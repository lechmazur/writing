    Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through scientific precision ("iridescent dust," "spiral arms," "neutron star's crust") mixed with poetic observation. The prose modulates effectively from clinical observation to emotional recognition, though the philosophical register in places ("poetry of decay," "kindled humility") slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature of glass artist seeing world through fracture/light. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. However, register drift into philosophical abstraction ("the kind that lingers") in final section breaks from established concrete voice. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("cathedral of sound...tomb of winterglass") and selective perception focused on vibration, texture, temperature. Some register elevation in peak moments ("raw, unshaken marvel") slightly strains the established voice. The perceptual signature of a musician feeling sound through scars and salt is compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "cracked from salt and sorrow" and "pulse slow, like the breath of a sleeping beast," with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure. The perceptual signature—how Elias notices decay and persistence simultaneously—remains consistent while allowing compression during the climb sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception ("He should have burned it. Instead..."). However, the piece occasionally drifts into overly literary register ("like water wearing down stone") and relies on telling rather than dramatizing key moments like the community joining the runs.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and metaphoric density ("spine of crumbling stone," "breath formed shapes"). The perceptual signature stays distinct—Elias notices light that "whispers," fog that "curls"—though occasional register elevation ("pilgrimaging toward") slightly strains the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Liora's geometric/architectural lens ("fractal patterns," "hyperbolic geometry") and tactile focus on textures. Syntax mirrors stress through fragmentation ("Find the texture. Find the seam.") and elongation during revelation. Minor register drift occurs with "retrocognitively trapped" feeling more clinical than the established lyric voice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with evocative phrasing like "the wall was already forgotten" and controlled rhythm that accelerates during the guard encounter. Some register elevation in places ("grace so staggering") slightly exceeds the established voice. The perceptual signature of noticing decay and potential ("stuffed bears with one eye," seeds that "glinted") is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthesia ("violet hum of rust," "bruise of indigo") creates a unique consciousness. Voice maintains consistency through technical precision (hearing aid designer) applied to emotional phenomena. Minor compression in emotional peaks is purposeful, and the shift to short declaratives in the ending ("Let them drown him") effectively signals surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with gems like "shadow with a gilded edge" and "the golden hour stretching into something endless." However, register occasionally drifts toward overwrought ("the kind of night that only exists in memories and thieves' tales") and the stationmaster's dialogue lacks distinction from narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices through her glassblower's lens—"coaxing it to remember its fire," seeing cracks as records not wounds. The rhythmic control during the valve-turning sequence effectively heightens pressure, though occasional filter phrases ("she thought of") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("cliff dives with frayed ropes, car flips with faulty harnesses") and character-specific perception. Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Yeah, well. I'm good at breaking rules"). Some filter verb accumulation ("Lena hesitated," "Lena moved") and occasional register elevation ("The betrayal coiled tighter") that doesn't fully match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through silence-as-substance: "ambered hush," "silence could be a wound or a cradle." Lyric compression teaches its pattern early and maintains consistency. The shift from "His voice...was not a sound but a shape" demonstrates exceptional control of register under conceptual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent close-third POV with robot-specific perception ("optical sensors zooming," "processors hummed"). Some register drift into philosophical abstraction ("the act of reaching into the unknown") that exceeds a janitor robot's initial lexicon. Dialogue from the violin works as supernatural element but voice could be more distinctly mechanical early on.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("water trickling through crystal pavers, each step releasing a whisper of light"). POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation ("resonant hush," "luminous") slightly exceeds Lena's established lexicon but serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception (focusing on tactile garden details) and appropriate register, but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntax that would elevate it. Dialogue feels serviceable rather than charged with subtext—"Your section is deficient" and "This wasn't in the tally" convey information without the indirection of natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("mechanically warm," "sideways current") that suits the philosophical sci-fi tone. POV remains stable with Elias. Some register elevation in peak moments ("metal fatigues singing") slightly exceeds the technician's established lexicon, though the overall texture remains compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through musical metaphor ("breath held too long in unstruck chords," "water lapped like a slow, patient tongue"). Voice maintains consistency under pressure. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("liminal place") that briefly diverges from Elias's embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with selective perception: "The station's radio crackled, a voice from the lowland observatory asking for her forecast." The metaphorical register fits an oracle figure, and syntactic variety supports the accumulative mode. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices barometric pressure, wind shifts, and the smell of "ozone and old blood."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Elias's scavenger-skeptic lens ("appraised it not by touch but by the way his pulse jumped"). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, atmospheric sentences give way to staccato fragments during the apparition ("The tunnel groaned. A geyser of black water erupted"). No head-hopping, controlled psychic distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through selective attention to texture (moss, paper edges, water's breath) and temporal distortion ("time did not pass so much as pool"). Syntax mirrors consciousness—long, flowing sentences for dissolution moments, shorter fragments for physical actions. The voice maintains consistency even as the keeper's identity blurs.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias's perceptual signature is distinct ("noticed two things immediately," musical metaphors throughout). Some lovely compression ("voice rough as dried sage"). Dialogue limited but functional. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the established voice ("celestial spectacle").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinctly literary with controlled lyricism ("bronze quiet hum," "grooves of a colossal phonograph"). The perceptual signature is consistently selective—Elias notices textures, temperatures, and resonances others might miss. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close interiority to wider observation. Minor weakness in occasional over-elevation ("ghost of heat") that slightly exceeds the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through Chen's fortune-writer lens - "vague enough to fit any life, sharp enough to cut when timing aligned." Brief dialogue maintains naturalism ("They're coming for the film" / "What about you?"). Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative fortune-writing to urgent departure, though some filter verbs ("Chen knew how this worked") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and effective use of italicized dialogue as thought-action. The perceptual signature around color and geometry is consistent. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the mystical-practical hybrid voice ("telegraphed its own obsolescence").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Li Wei's synesthetic awareness ("air tasted of ice and old electricity") and his tendency to map time through sensory memory. The prose rhythm successfully modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the fragmentary memories, maintaining coherent POV throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("Not backward, but *sideways*") and purposeful compression. POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in how Elias experiences gravity and time differently. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("procedural generation") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon, though it serves the speculative concept.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm that mirrors Elias's interior state ("time moved only in the slow pulse of crafting"). Sign language dialogue feels natural and advances plot efficiently. Perceptual signature is strong—Elias experiences the world through vibration and pressure rather than sound, creating a distinct sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature tracks atmospheric data through meteorological expertise ("needle that quivered at the faintest shift in barometric pressure"). Voice maintains consistency through measured, precise diction that mirrors Elias's scientific discipline. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice holds under pressure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("The greenhouse hummed with the breath of forgotten things"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and selective perception focused on light and scent. Free indirect style works well in the flashback. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("erosion" metaphor) that slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("tick—what was. tick—what could be") and selective perception focused on texture and pattern. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, accelerating during the rope's resonant snap. Minor register elevation in places ("currency, their art") slightly exceeds the drifting poet's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora's perceptual signature as an "acoustically perceptive" artist shapes descriptions through sound—the violin suspending air, the hush that makes ears ache, drops unbinding silence. The prose rhythm varies effectively between longer atmospheric passages and shorter urgent moments when the girl appears. Minor dialogue feels natural with subtext ("You're real"/"So are you"). Slight deduction for occasional elevation into writerly register ("cathedral of silence").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("calibrated to read the static charge") with lyrical perception ("walls pulsing with trapped sunlight"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("the pause between a lie and the moment you decide to tell the truth") slightly exceeds the POV's established range but maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's voice maintains consistency with phrases like "calculus of profit" and commercial metaphors throughout. The dialogue feels natural with proper subtext ("You're the one who leaves oranges"). Minor weakness in the slightly elevated register of some narration ("dissolved into the salt-kissed breeze") that occasionally drifts from Elias's merchant perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive lyric voice with selective perception ("hands remembered...before her mind did"). The prose modulates effectively between crystalline description and embodied action. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful - "You didn't have to look"/"But we did" carries strong subtext about chosen connection.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong perceptual signature throughout—"canals carved into rooftops," "moth with wings like stained glass." The dialogue between Elspeth and the boy carries effective subtext about time's nature. Minor issues with filter verbs ("she knew," "she already knew") slightly dull immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: "each fracture a variable, each color a coefficient" shows how the mathematical mind processes physical reality. Minor filter verb clustering in middle sections ("He thought," "He understood") slightly dulls immediacy but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's perceptual signature—tactile focus on metal pipes, acute awareness of sounds through vents, cataloging of cached objects—creates a distinct focalizer who experiences the world through hidden infrastructure. Voice modulates effectively from methodical observation to urgency during the outage. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("You were there," "There are more"). Some filter verbs ("he knew," "he remembered") slightly dull immediacy in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains botanical precision mixed with wonder ("serrated edges," "unspooling of their very nature"), though occasional register drifts toward abstract philosophizing weaken immediacy. The perceptual signature—a botanist noticing cellular patterns and plant behaviors—stays consistent, and the rhythm appropriately accelerates during the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinctive voice through compressed, comma-heavy syntax ("Elias—who hadn't slept through a full night since the water wars ended—pried it free") and wry observations. The parenthetical aside "(He should've turned back...)" effectively modulates distance. Dialogue carries subtext well—"You're late" / "Late for what?" exchange conveys otherworldly authority meeting human bewilderment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical compression ("dusk bled into violet") and Liora's perceptual signature filters throughout, particularly in how she experiences the cave's synesthesia. The entity's dialogue ("magic isn't in the grand gestures") carries appropriate otherworldliness, though brief passages drift toward elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("ocean-spray archivist," "heartbeat, not steady, but syncopated"). Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("herald's trumpet valve" formality). The child's presence late creates minor POV wobble but dialogue lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice combines precise cartographic language with lyrical compression ("mist curled," "stars bleeding through like wounds"). The perceptual signature of seeing patterns and fractures everywhere reflects Elias's character. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("fortress of unspoken truths") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("space *stretched*—not outward, but *inward*"). Perceptual signature clear in how Liora notices astronomical/navigational details. Some register drift occurs in philosophical passages ("cartographer of echoes," "frequency only the brave or broken could hear") that doesn't fully match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to an ancient immortal, with perceptual signature filtering reality through dimensional awareness—"geometry gone feral," "spatial mutiny." Slight register drift occurs with "compared notes on goodbyes" feeling contemporary against the mythic tone. Psychic distance modulates effectively from observation to immersion as transformation approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on mathematical/transactional details fitting Lira's background. The girl's dialogue carries authentic urgency ("You count what's missing"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("porcelain surface streaked with ghosts") that slightly exceeds the established voice range.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical control with distinctive rhythms—"his breath fogging the glass dome over the bonsai forest." The perceptual signature is selective and character-specific, focusing on textures and frequencies. Psychic distance remains appropriately close throughout, though occasional elevated diction ("incandescent restraint") slightly exceeds the POV's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("salt and rust," hearing port rhythm as "layers"), with controlled modulation as Daniel moves from observer to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent texture through "drunken dream," "anarchic carnival folk," and physical details like "brass cuff...gears whirring." Dialogue feels natural ("They'll see it as vandalism"/"Let them"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in abstract moments ("dual allegiance gnawed") but perceptual signature stays distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "kicking up ghosts of light" and the camera's "hungry" lens. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical observation to terse action ("He snapped the shot. Then another."). The controlled rhythm in "But nights did end. And so did craters" heightens impact without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision filtered through tactile perception—"feedback," "refraction," "hairline fracture"—creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent intervention to quiet return. Captain's single line of dialogue carries appropriate authority and recognition.

    Distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices through cartographic precision ("north-by-northwest," "delta, a fork") that transforms into mythic recognition. The voice modulates from dry observation to participatory awe while maintaining coherence, and the lake's "voice" speaking in the dead tongue feels earned through prior textual preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fingers stained with the dust of forgotten things"). The prose modulates effectively with the town's awakening, maintaining consistency even under pressure, with purposeful compression that serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression like "the silence between echoes where time itself thinned like frayed silk." POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some filter phrases like "she knew" and "she thought" slightly dull immediacy in places but don't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinctive voice with inventive metaphors ("rusted needle in the throat of the sea"), controlled rhythm that modulates with tension. The whispers' dialogue carries authentic otherness.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "a man of frayed edges" whose voice is "a rasp from years of whispering verses to the wind." Rhythmic control modulates effectively between lyric description and urgent transformation. The purposeful elision of exact mechanics during sleepwalking is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.7)

The perceptual signature shows in unique observations like "each tick a path not taken." Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You're the one who listens"). Deduction for some register elevation that strains POV credibility ("adjacent possibilities," "unified narrative").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm—"each knot a whisper, each hollow a sigh." The prose modulates from contemplative to urgent ("What are you waiting for?") to serene resolution, maintaining coherent POV throughout with purposeful compression that serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains literary control with distinctive syntax ("shrewdly innocent that way") and selective perception filtering war and medical experience. Dialogue carries subtext—"I unknot them" reveals method while maintaining distance. Some register elevation in peaks ("labyrinthine grooves mirroring the atrium's archways") slightly exceeds the intimate POV established elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("paints mixed from captured light," "shadows blurred into dusk"). Perceptual signature strong—Liora notices through an artist's lens. Minor register elevation in places ("collective murk") but maintains coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm, especially in fragments like "The nickel glinted as it left her fingers, arcing into the painted sky—where it became a star, then a coin, then a key."

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism and strong perceptual signature in how Elara experiences the archive. Some register drift into elevated diction ("monument to dead lies," "gestation") that occasionally strains the POV. The extended ending shifts into more distant, omniscient territory that weakens voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with musical metaphors threading throughout ("coos...only sound that didn't make him flinch," "lyrics he could no longer sing," "wings cutting through dust-mote constellations"). Perceptual signature is distinct—Elias reads dust patterns like sheet music, measures everything in musical terms even while avoiding music itself.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature with architectural/analytical vocabulary ("calculated to make losers question," "analyzing the way the fibers curled"). Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively from external search to intimate understanding. Minor deduction for Liora's dialogue occasionally exceeding plausible child register ("Some thresholds need to be crossed alone").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice through specialized lexicon ("photophores," "vane," "celestial scope") and lyrical compression ("softly ingenious"). POV remains controlled with clear perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with distinctive perceptual signature ("sea-foam recollectionist," "breadcrumbs of possibility"), though occasional register drift occurs ("transliterating emotions"). The prose successfully teaches its pattern of metaphorical density early and maintains it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains distinctive texture through musical metaphors ("violin case propped open like a hungry mouth") and precise sensory selection reflecting Lior's performer's eye.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "blade unsheathed," "where the last light bled into shadow." Rhythm modulates from flowing observation to staccato ritual moments ("She watched. / A heron..."). The parenthetical ending "(They would call it heresy, later...)" effectively shifts perspective while maintaining voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice maintains a distinct meditative register with controlled rhythm that mirrors Elias's careful attention ("The stone broke the surface with a sound like a sigh").

Free indirect style is clean, and the prose modulates effectively between description and interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to Elias's trauma and the story's accumulative mode. Strong perceptual signature in how he notices textures and scars. However, some phrases feel overwrought ("slow dance of celestial bodies" appears twice, "silvering the needles of the pines like scattered bones"). The lack of dialogue is appropriate but limits dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyrical-scientific register appropriate to Liora's character as "logical dreamer." Perceptual signature is distinct in how she sees "equations in the curve of a shell." Some passages lean toward overwrought ("the quiet, serene upheaval of a world remade"), but rhythm generally supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature with Elias's synesthetic ability to hear/map echoes others miss. Voice maintains consistency through lyrical descriptions and specialized vocabulary ("corridor echo cartographer"). Some elevated diction ("ivy-veiled," "sensitively perceptive") occasionally strains against the intimate POV, and dialogue absence limits full assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("each borrowed or stolen, each whispered to"), and Liora's perceptual signature shapes description ("fractured rainbows that bled across the damp flagstones"). Minor register drift occurs in explanatory passages about her gift, but the voice coheres at crucial moments, particularly in the controlled final vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("the grain dark as the void between stars"). Dialogue carries strong subtext, particularly "You'll break this one too"/"Probably."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains Elias's selective perception ("traced the cracks with his fingertips," "warm as a secret") with controlled distance that modulates during the egg placement. However, occasional register elevations ("slow violence of a drought," "counterpoint: a single, stubborn note") strain against the otherwise grounded diction, and some syntactic patterns repeat ("He had...," "He would...").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance and purposeful compression in lyric passages. Some elevated diction ("chaste courtesan," "living poem") fits the mythic register but occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The perceptual signature shows selectivity—focusing on texture, temperature, and sound—though a few passages slip into omniscient certainty about what "the world would call" her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinctive voice balances lyrical compression ("meteor hush," "the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match") with precise physical detail. POV remains tightly controlled through Elias's selective perception—noticing acoustic curves, grain patterns, the weight of inherited objects. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative passages and the sharp violence of the miner's intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent philosophical-poetic register appropriate to an "esoteric realist." Perceptual signature is distinct: Lior notices weight of wind, papery wing texture, the way light slants. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Minor repetition in sentence openings ("The monarchs were gone," "The wind remembered") doesn't significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception ("fingers—still gentle despite decades of wax and flame"). Some passages achieve genuine beauty, but occasional overwriting ("snowmelt ardor given form") and abstract constructions weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Lior's specific consciousness ("the kind her grandmother had warned her about in riddles"), with controlled psychic distance that tightens during peak moments. The italicized other-Lior dialogue and terminal messages create textural variety without breaking POV consistency.

The perceptual signature remains consistent with an astronomer's precise observation. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression. Strong perceptual signature in how Lior experiences the sanctuary's shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains lyric control through selective perception—the mirror maker notices frost "like shattered glass," feels the sextant's "faintest hum." The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the breathing sequence. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly controlled even as boundaries dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through craft metaphors (quartz-eye mender, stitching wound to wound). Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively from external observation to intimate reflection. Minor register elevation in places ("gilt," "deciduous") stays within bounds of this POV's lexicon as a skilled craftsperson.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct curatorial voice with academic precision ("palimpsest," "nonlinear inheritance") that fragments under pressure. The reflection's dialogue creates effective uncanny doubling. Some register elevation in places ("astral orchard pulsed with violet blossoms") slightly exceeds Veyra's established lexicon but serves the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with academic precision ("arcane linguist," "Chronoarchivist's vault") that modulates into vulnerability at closure.

The perceptual signature of noticing decay and transformation is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's perceptual signature—seeing records in rope braids, translating confusion methodically—remains consistent. The prose modulates effectively from precise observation to lyrical impossibility, though some phrases like "cathedral of brass and silence" edge toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through Eldrin's sensory focus on vibration, texture, and geological memory. Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching emotional beats. Some filter verbs ("understood," "felt") slightly dull immediacy in places. The voice maintains consistency through pressure, though a few moments of elevated diction ("harmonic caves had always hummed with the breath of the world") slightly exceed the POV's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinctive perceptual signature: the custodian notices through retrocognitive filtering, seeing "echoes of what had been" in present objects. Rhythmic control intensifies during the beacon sequence with shorter, breathless sentences ("The prism groaned. Then, with a sound like a held breath released, it *mended*"). The lyric compression serves the accumulative design without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "the slow creak of the tower settling" and "crystal flags humming under the weight of the rain's afterecho." Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though occasional drift into elevated register ("the breath of the unspoken") slightly exceeds POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression: "petals like embers caught in slow motion," "the hush was thick enough to chew." Liora's perceptual signature filters through pyrotechnic awareness—she notices "the metallic tang of old wishes," binds "gunpowder and colored salts into a spiral." Some elevated diction ("fleeting constellation, defiant and bright") occasionally drifts from her wanderer's register but supports the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the chronicler notices through marine metaphors ("like a crab sidles toward its prey"), tangential observation, and textural detail. Prose rhythm modulates effectively, particularly in the grotto sequence. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("metallic tang," "tangential approach") that slightly exceeds the naturalistic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic silence-tasting ("coppery and thick, like licking a battery") and the child's selective attention to textures. Purposeful compression works through taught elision (mother never explained, father's past untold). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "intangibly tangible" and "xenial" that briefly tensions the child-POV.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's professional attention to silence gradients and the storm glass's states. Voice modulates effectively from meditative observation to sparse dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Lina's pyramid-scheme-survivor lens colors everything ("recognized a relic of broken faith"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the reality-shift sequence. Minor convergence in message dialogue lacks distinction but POV remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register ("golden shadows stretched like lazy fingers") that maintains consistency through pressure. The mirror-self's silent communication adds textural variety.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose maintains a distinct gothic-lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density: "sky split like rotten silk," "banners dissolved into moths."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception fitting an archivist ("scraps—receipts, whispered confessions"). The prose modulates effectively between lyrical observation ("sky bled violet") and stark declaration ("Indifference was the real tyrant"). Some filter verb clustering in middle sections ("would be," "would still be") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with distinctive phrasings like "subtraction" of sound and "vested hush," though occasional abstractions ("weight of unspoken things") reduce immediacy. POV control is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature of experiencing sound as negative space is consistent. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("ghosts testing the edges of the living") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct mythic voice with controlled diction ("the hush, the breath between") and consistent POV that filters perception through Liora's seed-sorter lens.

Strong perceptual signature in how she reads with fingertips and sorts by sound.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (the tinkerer notices mechanical details, broken patterns).

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct alchemist voice with controlled lexicon ("crucible," "retort," "transmutation") and rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature appears in phrases like "seep into Echo Gorge" and "tuning fork vibrates against bone." The spectral dialogue maintains naturalistic indirection ("I haven't done that in a hundred years").

Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly the painter's cryptic guidance that advances plot through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's technical reading of dust as language and his horologist's understanding of mechanisms—"fatigue didn't leave cracks that pulsed faintly, like a slow breath."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature with Elias moving in "deliberate silence," sensing books that "hummed when touched." Strong rhythmic control accelerates during the pressing sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("volatile," "negotiable") that slightly exceeds the established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "threads unspooling from the wrists of its citizens until the day the threads snapped."

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct voice modulates from controlled observation ("brass walls vibrating") to fractured intensity ("The walls screamed as they unspooled").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "the way a held object could whisper its past if you were quiet enough" and controlled rhythm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("blue dot winking out like a dying star"). POV maintains consistent close third with effective free indirect style. Minor register elevation in philosophical moments slightly exceeds character lexicon but serves the piece's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lyric voice maintains consistent texture through fragments, repetition, and rhythmic control: "The pavilion stood. / The flowers listened. / And the world, for a moment, was perfect." POV remains stable with Liora's selective perception filtering details like the jasmine's night-blooming and the glass's hidden layers. The fragmentary structure in the final third effectively mimics the "hush" the story explores, though occasionally drifts toward overwrought lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice emerges through selective perception ("wound in the earth," "retroactive fever dream") and controlled register shifts that match emotional intensity. The prose maintains consistent focalization through Elias's archival lens, though dialogue is minimal and the Historical Revision Board's speech feels slightly generic ("trespassing on restricted memory").

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("lanterns bobbed like fireflies," "ghost's kitchen"). POV remains stable with the alchemist's perceptual signature intact. The child's single line of dialogue feels natural with appropriate informality. Minor weakness in occasional elevated diction ("crucible," "vessel") that slightly distances during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice maintains distinct texture through selective perception (Elias notices grooves, ink smudges, childhood memories) and specialized lexicon fitting an oath scribe. The Akkadian emergence and shift to direct address create purposeful distance modulation. Prose rhythm accelerates during the prophecy's emergence ("The water darkened") then slows for reflection, supporting emotional beats without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with selective perception ("brittle crescent moon," "blue half-light") that matches the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains distinctive texture through specialized diction ("microclimate variations," "whale-sinew") and rhythmic control that mirrors Elias's methodical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent contemplative register with moments of genuine poetry ("where the universe whispered secrets only the patient could hear").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice maintains lyrical consistency throughout, with controlled rhythm that mirrors the story's meditative pace. Perceptual signature strong—"learning to read the wind's warnings in the way light bent through its cracks." No dialogue preserves the silence motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong perceptual signature with selective noticing ("cracked lens," "eyes like cracked porcelain"). The lyric voice maintains consistency through metaphorical density.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature where the poet notices edges, fragments, and incomplete things others would overlook. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the compressed final sections. Elision is purposeful (not writing down what he sees) and paid off. Minor register elevation in places ("harmonizing discord") but largely consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third-person with selective perception (Elira notices botanical details, oxidation patterns). Dialogue between Elira and Tomas carries subtext effectively ("teaching them to ask" vs "beg"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in narrative voice during some descriptive passages that doesn't fully match Elira's practical perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-scientific register with controlled moments like "leaving the tower's stone skin slick with memory" and dialogue that carries subtext ("That's not a warning.

The POV maintains stable focalization throughout with purposeful withholding that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "needle of black ice piercing the belly of the wrong sky." Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I think it's a thing to be amended").

    Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("cathedral of forgotten kings," "luminous absence"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature in how Liora reads gestures and absences.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyric voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (focusing on threads, metallic veins, frozen moments). The brief dialogue feels natural and carries subtext. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("the quiet alchemy of forgiveness") that doesn't fully match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains lyric intensity with controlled compression: "The canyon breathed before dawn, its walls of bone humming with the weight of unspoken names." POV remains tightly focused through Liora's perception, with selective attention to tactile details ("chalked with the dust of old carvings"). The rhythmic control during the climax—short, urgent sentences as she carves—heightens pressure without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm acceleration toward closure ("The key turned. The world held its breath."). Some register elevation in places ("gnawed at the hull," "wound from a time before memory") but serves the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent maritime metaphor throughout ("fathoms," "divining rod," "ship of its own"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext—riddles that require translation, the woman's hitching breath. The perceptual signature of a navigator pervades: everything becomes coordinates, charts, courses. Brief dialogue convergence at "Is this—?" / "The way back" reads intentional at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Lior notices textures ("rough as a scar"), counts time by mist patterns, processes grief through taste. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (shorter, sharper sentences during the warlord's men encounter), and the controlled elision about the sister's death pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "breath of the sea at nautical twilight" while staying grounded in Elias's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout with parenthetical asides creating temporal uncertainty ("Or never here. Or both."). Prose modulates effectively between lyric compression and scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct narrative voice balances lyrical description ("liquid twilight") with sharp dialogue ("Words are easy. This?"), maintaining consistency through emotional intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinctive perceptual signature: "signs for sounds that had no voice," "thread of smoke in the damp air." Lyric compression serves the accumulative mode well, with taught patterns like italicized phrases marking different registers of meaning.
