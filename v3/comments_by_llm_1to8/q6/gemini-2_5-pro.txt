Minor weakness in the slightly elevated register during action ("folded the world around himself") that briefly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent formal register with controlled rhythm that modulates effectively during Elara's declaration ("We receive this gift").

The performative framing device works well but sometimes strains under emotional pressure rather than naturally modulating.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with stunt-double perception ("When a wire snaps, you adapt"). Controlled psychic distance shifts appropriately during stress. Julian's dialogue carries actor's artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)

    Distinct perceptual signature with Elara's focus on textures (silk, grit, liquid light) and her royal perspective coloring observations. Clean POV control throughout with intentional psychic distance shifts. Minor register elevation in "delicate filigree of light" slightly exceeds established voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's synesthetic reading of emotional terrain from physical cues. The prose rhythm effectively slows during the screw reading, matching contemplative discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive formal register suits the rune scholar POV, with controlled syntax maintaining the "saturated hush" tone. Some filter constructions ("he had tried," "he had learned") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signatures: Julian's emotional filtering versus Vex's clinical-mystical observations ("gravel wrapped in silk"). Some filter verbs remain but serve the ethereal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent wry distance with phrases like "soft thud of moss on brick" and "Grand Central Malaise."

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with maritime precision ("coiled," "sublittoral fringe") and mythic register for the island.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct voice through the theatrical register ("our hero procures the vessel") contrasting with flat affect ("his voice flat, stripped of all theatricality").

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent limited third-person POV through Elian's colorblind perception shapes the entire narrative texture. Voice modulates appropriately during the climactic breath across the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct voices: Elara's measured architectural vocabulary versus Julian's hesitant vulnerability. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara sees cards as "stark, onyx-ink designs."

    Perceptual signature crystallizes in clinical-poetic duality ("court-mandated motivation," "universe of soft blue light"). Rhythm accelerates in descent ("narrowing to flashlight beam"), compressing stress without syntax collapse. Zero register drift despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature excels via scent-based noticing ("burnt sugar, clean snow"), but syntactic uniformity under peak stress (transformation) lacks the compression expected during such a physically/psychologically shattering moment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: cartomancer’s tactile focus ("cool ceramic," "thrumming energy") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control elevates climax ("The silver clasp gave way with a soft click"), though "fractured heart" slightly dilutes voice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("salt-stung clothes," "vibrant hush") modulates with cosmic pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("plume of steam rose... glowing with soft, verdant luminescence") avoids lyric overwriting while teaching compression pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("winking hush," "pearlescent light") and rhythmic control under pressure ("For a moment, nothing happened") modulate tension. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure’s crystalline moment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("frictionless wall of water," "panicked fractals") persists under stress; rhythmic control in climax ("The wave did not crash; it split") modulates tension without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("sea of clouds churned, silently blasted") modulates with stress: long lyrical sentences fracture into staccato beats during timer countdown. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices "burnished composite" light on brass gears while ignoring the brook’s sound during fencing. Rhythmic control under pressure—sentences tighten during lunges ("a whirlwind of dignified chaos")—with patterned elision (no Elara’s arrival) taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature shines: Silas notices "water-warped spines" and "rusted girders," reflecting Architect’s salvager lens. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences when drifters appear ("Silas’s breath caught")—without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: musician translates visual glitches into staccato notes. Rhythmic control peaks in "brute-force attack" crescendo, with compression taught early (film study) and paid off in sonic translation—zero head-hopping, voice modulates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical world," "chaotic dream-notes") modulates under stress; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's "drops as promise" with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: bonsai focus shapes noticing ("errant needle," "spiral knot"). Rhythm modulates with stress, though "concentrated agony" drifts slightly from Kenji’s lexicon during climax.
