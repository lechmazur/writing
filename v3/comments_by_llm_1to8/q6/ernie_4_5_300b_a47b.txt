  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close-third POV with scientific precision filtering perception ("waveform of a dying pulsar," "accretion disks"). Voice modulates effectively between technical observation and wonder. Some register elevation in places like "raw, unfiltered process" slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("melting scrap glass into vases that caught the sun in liquid swirls"). The perceptual signature—seeing through an artist's eye—stays distinct, though occasional abstractions ("drifting resonance of the words") slightly dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception filtered through Lirael's composer's sensibility ("leaves curled like musical notes"). The prose modulates effectively between technical precision and emotional intensity. Minor inconsistency in register when describing the worldwide performances feels slightly elevated beyond the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with undertaker-specific perception like "each coffin a promise" and "hands, calloused and stained with embalming fluid." Dialogue between Elias and Marisol carries subtext effectively, particularly in their exchange about grief and mechanics. Some passages drift into elevated register ("the city's heart stopped beating") that doesn't quite match Elias's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("amplified quiet") and appropriate register. However, dialogue lacks distinction—Mira's speech and the storytellers' voices converge into similar rhythms. The piece relies heavily on summary narration where scene work would strengthen immediacy, particularly during the council debate and community response.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register with phrases like "foggy lucidity" and "pilgrim of sparks," though Lira's voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond artistic observation. No dialogue appears, and the narration occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("She understood now").

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong perceptual signature with Elara's designer-eye noting "hyperbolic geometry" and spatial impossibilities. The prose maintains consistent psychic distance and filters the magical realism through her professional lens, though some passages drift toward overwrought ("quaking reverie," "pixelate, dissolving into a swarm of fireflies").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency through selective perception focused on puzzle elements and tactile details. "Staggering grace" appears in Lirael's movement at the climax. Some phrases like "ghost's whisper" and "liquid starlight" feel elevated beyond the established register, and filter verbs ("knew she had moments") occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lira's synesthetic perception creates a distinct voice ("heard colors faintly as vibrations in her cochlea"), with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization. The prose modulates effectively from technical precision ("liquid memory—clear, viscous substances labeled with dates") to visceral sensation ("a scream of glass shattering"), though some filter constructions could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elegance with phrases like "golden-hour portrait thief" and "liquid starlight," though occasionally drifts toward overwriting ("dormant star," "second skin"). The perceptual signature of noticing light and shadow is distinctive. Some filter phrases ("she believed," "she thought") slightly dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael's theatrical self-narration ("I now dislodge a rusted screw...Its resistance mirrors the rigidity of those who fear change") creates a distinct voice that blends whimsy with contemplation. The prose maintains consistent POV and psychic distance, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("entropy," "insulated from the world's chaos") that occasionally disconnects from the character's craftsman perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Lila's fear-driven awareness ("boots echoed," "knees protesting"). Dialogue between Lila and enforcer carries subtext and advances plot. However, the mother's dialogue lacks distinction from Lila's register, and some interiority relies on telling ("firmly adaptive despite her fears").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through sound's absence and tactile sensation ("fingers tracing," "air hummed," "silence so thick it seemed to pulse"). Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent sketching to peaceful acceptance. Minor voice drift occurs with "palimpsest of echoes" feeling slightly academic for the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with mechanical precision appropriate to a robot protagonist, and phrases like "remarkably composed rhythm" establish character-specific perception. However, the dialogue feels stilted and overly articulate for both characters, lacking naturalistic subtext or genuine conversational rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent formality fitting a night registrar's precision, with controlled rhythm in descriptive passages. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You're late" revealing prior expectation). However, Lira's speech tends toward abstract pronouncements ("honesty is the only currency left") that lack naturalistic grounding, and some filter constructions ("Elias thought of") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture—Elara's perceptual signature doesn't differentiate from standard third-person description. Dialogue between Elara and Joren is functional but lacks subtext; their exchange proceeds through direct questions and explanations without indirection or character-specific speech patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Technical vocabulary ("magnetic nexus," "holographic grids," "secondary coils") maintains consistency with Veyra's mechanic expertise. Brief dialogue from LUX and the director serves functional purposes. POV remains stable, though perceptual signature could be more distinct—Veyra notices equipment but her unique way of seeing doesn't fully emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("Clara had always felt most alive in these in-between spaces"). Some filter verb clusters ("seemed to," "began to") slightly dull immediacy. The perceptual signature of a musician noticing sound and silence is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Lirael's focus on margins, edges, and botanical details. The prose modulates effectively from analytical precision to more fragmented perception under stress. Minor dialogue between Lirael and the herbalist feels slightly convenient, though the director's earlier line lands well.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's "religiously skeptical" voice maintains consistency through phrases like "Science met superstition, his usual MO" and perceptual details like "drowsy alertness sharpening." The mechanical voice's layered static and the hologram's stuttering effectively distinguish non-human speakers, though some passages drift into explanatory register ("human failure, amplified by greed and fear").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm ("Here, they were not a guardian of history but a witness to its slow unraveling"). The perceptual signature shows in selective noticing of decay and transformation, though occasional elevated diction ("festered like rot") slightly strains the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with musical metaphors ("sound like wind chimes," "notes spiraled upward") appropriate to the music therapist POV. Dialogue differentiates characters effectively—Mara's bluntness ("You brought the curl") against Elara's softer expansiveness, though some philosophical exchanges feel slightly writerly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent intellectual curiosity with phrases like "whispers of inanimate things" and "bronze quiet" that feel particular to Elias's historian perspective. The free indirect style effectively modulates between observation and reflection. Minor weakness in the slightly elevated register during the final paragraph that doesn't quite match earlier diction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphors ("carved through fog like a silver blade") and character-specific perception. The POV holds steady through third-limited, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("Her fortunes were never random") without sufficient grounding in Elara's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice through philosophical register and rhythmic control—"walls lined with velvet so thick it swallowed sound" shows texture. The loop pedal conceit allows natural repetition that serves pressure. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("cacophony of possibilities") that doesn't fully match the priest's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to Lirael's artistic sensibility, with controlled rhythm in lines like "the dawn's first light fractured through prismatic walls." POV remains stable in close third. Some filter verbs ("she imagined," "she'd learned") slightly dull immediacy but serve the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting Mara's detached perspective ("spectral light," "fractured timeline"). Some passages achieve lyric compression effectively. However, register occasionally drifts into conceptual abstractions that strain the POV's immediacy, particularly in timeline navigation sections.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective sensory perception appropriate to a deaf narrator—emphasis on vibration, texture, visual rhythm. The perceptual signature is distinct ("translating sound into vibrations, rhythms into light"). However, some passages drift into elevated register ("palimpsest of emotion") that doesn't fully align with the established voice, and dialogue lacks sufficient distinctiveness between characters.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("brass device no larger than a fist"). Voice modulates appropriately from measured observation to urgency. Some register drift into elevated diction ("bulwark against chaos," "layered tranquility") that doesn't fully match Elias's pragmatic character, and dialogue feels slightly functional rather than naturalistic.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"The greenhouse for extinct plants hummed with a quiet, almost sacred energy." POV remains stable in close third, though some passages edge toward omniscient summary ("The perfume wasn't just a scent; it was a vessel for memory"). Perceptual signature is strong in sensory selectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's voice shows distinct texture in "ink-stained fingers," "ethically playful" laugh, and poet's sensibility, but the being's dialogue often shifts into abstract philosophy-speak ("Impossible choices are the loom of existence") that creates register drift. Some filter-heavy passages ("Kael felt," "He'd always believed") dull immediacy during crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature—"glass cathedral," "echo-harbor violinist," "chronic hush." The POV's acoustic sensitivity colors perception throughout ("drip of condensation, the creak of shipwreck hulls"). Minor register elevation in "mend the cracks in the world" slightly exceeds the established voice but doesn't break it.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent formality matching Elias's "professionally thorough nature" with controlled diction: "purveyor," "concoctions," "attune." The perceptual signature focuses on precise sensory details relevant to his craft. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext—Lira's whispered request, Elias's measured response—though both characters' speech patterns could be more distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains competent literary prose but lacks distinctive texture - Clara's interiority could belong to any educated protagonist. The perceptual signature wavers between business calculation and sudden lyricism ("lighthouse eyes"). Most problematic: no dialogue appears despite multiple character interactions, creating distance where immediacy would strengthen the compassion theme.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a sculptor's attention to light and form. Dialogue between Kael and Lira feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some phrases like "liquid mercury" and "vibrant tapestry" trend toward writerly cliché rather than character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct voice with lyrical precision ("silver serpent," "loom of time"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the tunnel sequence. The italicized voice and Lila's thoughts create effective layers. Minor register elevation in places ("resonant hum vibrated") slightly above natural idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lyrical voice with controlled mystical register ("shimmered like liquid starlight") maintains consistency. Perceptual signature shows through mathematical/pattern-seeking focus. Minor repetition of "fractal" and some elevated diction in emotional peaks ("ethereal blue") but rhythm modulates effectively with scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature with Mara's methodical, spatial intelligence evident in how she navigates and maps spaces. Voice maintains consistency through technical precision ("ferromagnetic," "pipe chases"). Dialogue from the tape reads authentically urgent. Minor deduction for some filter-heavy passages ("she could see," "she heard").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature through botanical attention and scientific framing ("retraction," "metamorphosis," "chlorophyll"). Dialogue between Eleanor and Mara feels natural with appropriate subtext about control. Some filter verb accumulation ("She thought of," "She'd built") slightly dulls immediacy in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent wry earnestness through controlled diction ("water wars that had drowned the mainland's arrogance") and selective perception focused on artistic/sensory details. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("haggard awe prickled Marin's skin"), and dialogue occasionally feels writerly rather than spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature through musical and crystalline imagery maintains consistency. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext ("You didn't see me coming"), though the pilgrim's telepathic speech and some elevated diction ("conspire to create beauty from chaos") occasionally strain the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent distance with Lirael's scholarly perspective coloring observations ("ocean-spray archivist" idiom). Dialogue from fisherman and girl carries authentic roughness and youth respectively. However, the narrative voice tends toward expository summary ("Her method was staggered intervals...") rather than immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with effective free indirect style ("It wasn't just a tool; it was a key, he'd decided"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices patterns and geometry while also seeing beauty. The woman's dialogue feels slightly stilted ("The fortress isn't a destination. It's a choice"), creating register mismatch with Elias's more grounded observations.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting Clara's scientific-yet-searching mindset. Some filter verb clusters ("Clara felt," "She realized") in middle sections reduce immediacy. Strong perceptual signature in how she notices patterns and celestial details.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with character-specific perception ("dimensionally aware senses tingled") and controlled modulation during stress. Dialogue between Kael and Lira carries appropriate urgency, though occasional register elevation ("fractured rainbow," "defiant moon") slightly exceeds the POV's established baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency through Elara's twelve-year-old perspective, with appropriate observations like "crouched behind a mahogany casket." Dialogue differentiates characters adequately (agents' sneering, Harrow's protests, Elara's steady negotiation). Some phrases feel overwrought for the POV ("liquefying rigid thinking," "mathematics of equity"), creating occasional register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in passages like "each page a portal to a time that never was but could have been." However, the narrative voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Althea notices things generically rather than through her specific stationer's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature with Kael seeing "the green of jealousy in a smuggler's coat, the violet of regret in a widow's veil" establishes unique filtering. Dialogue feels natural when present ("Disappeared into the tide, they say"), though the narrative occasionally drifts into elevated register ("labyrinth swallowed them whole") slightly beyond the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled shifts in psychic distance, particularly effective when channeling the astronomer's voice in italics. Some register elevation appears in peak moments ("fossilized question," "universal riddle") that slightly exceeds Lira's established lexicon. The perceptual signature of a skeptic encountering wonder comes through, though occasional abstract phrasing ("dismantling legends with logic") weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception—Lira notices layout, patterns, encoded messages. Dialogue differentiates characters adequately (Jax's casual "madwoman" vs. Council's "ice" formality). Some filter verb accumulation ("told her," "felt") dulls immediacy in transition passages.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited through Lira's section with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("the moon wasn't a conquest. It was a mirror"). The shift to the archivist's POV at section break is clean, though this multi-POV structure slightly dilutes the intimacy of Lira's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and controlled diction appropriate to the technical setting. Dialogue between Lira and Marlow feels natural with proper subtext. Some filter phrases ("she could feel") slightly dull immediacy, and occasional register elevation ("liquid sunlight") doesn't fully match the workshop pragmatism.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clara's voice maintains dry wit ("The falcon's never late. It's the world that's out of sync") and professional precision (testing salinity, noting tectonic plates). Jorn's mechanic's rasp ("You'll die out there") contrasts effectively. Some passages drift toward elevated register during discovery ("rivers' source wasn't water. It was *light*") that slightly exceeds Clara's established lexicon, and the final paragraph's "quiet between heartbeats" feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with strong phrases like "ivy clawed at weathered stone" and "the wild hush of forgotten things." The prose rhythm mirrors the story's thematic concern with pattern and repetition effectively. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("tapestry of shared balance"), and the townsfolk lack distinct voices when they appear.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains underwater/archaeological register with selective perception focused on temple details and sensory cues. Some register drift into elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "ephemeral") that doesn't fully match Mara's practical diver persona. Clean POV control throughout with no head-hopping, though occasional filter verbs ("She needed to unsnarl") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical elements. POV remains stable with Elias throughout. Perceptual signature shows in details like "copperlight repose" and the lattice's "ironwork twisted like a question." However, dialogue between Elias and the ghost/double lacks distinction—all voices share similar cryptic registers without character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive Gothic register with "ashen-veil," "spectral iridescence," maintaining lyric consistency. The ghost's voice as "rustle of dead leaves" fits perfectly. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("latent magic," "ephemeral cameo") that slightly exceeds the POV's established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent lyric voice with controlled diction ("exhausted eyes," "nervous system" corridors) and strong perceptual signature in how Lira notices thread luminescence and wall grooves. Some register elevation in places ("residual magic," "silent pact") slightly exceeds the character's established voice. Rhythm modulates effectively with the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism: "warmly curious about every shadow." Perceptual signature consistent in how Lirael reads the landscape through archaeological and spiritual lenses. Minor repetition in descriptive patterns ("roots" appears frequently) prevents higher scoring, though this supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent techno-poetic register with selective perception ("ebony clipboard," "synth-coffee"). POV stays firmly with Lira throughout. Dialogue from vendor and carrier feels functional rather than distinctive. Some filter phrases ("Lira frowned," "She ignored him") slightly distance the reader during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with moments of effective free indirect style ("Today, however, the shadows felt heavier"). Dialogue feels slightly stilted but carries subtext about the rebellion. The perceptual signature focuses appropriately on textile and celestial details, though some phrases ("wind chimes laugh") feel forced.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Lirael experiences the spirits' songs as "fierce tenderness, a paradox that made her throat tighten." The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against character voice ("ephemeral," "coalesced").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Lira's translator lens shapes what she notices ("frayed words into bridges"). Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. Minor register elevation in "lotus-hearted ache" fits the lyrical mode but occasionally distances from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Lira notices light and color ("stolen sunbeam," "streaks of gold and violet") reflects her artist's eye. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical description to intimate revelation ("You're a message," she whispered"). The prose rhythm accelerates during the celebration scene through shorter, active sentences, then slows for reflection without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in "The garden's creator, a reclusive acoustician named Dr. Lysander, had designed the space to manipulate sound waves into tangible forms." Dialogue carries appropriate formality for the characters, though Lysander's entrances feel slightly convenient. The perceptual signature—Marisol's synesthetic attention to color-as-memory—distinguishes the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains scholarly whimsy ("oblique poetry," "candidly cryptic") but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond botanical focus. Dialogue between Elias and Lillian carries appropriate subtext and advances plot, though the masked figures remain voiceless ciphers. Some register elevation in peak moments ("fractal shadows," "symphony") strains against established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("reef-shadow joy," "half-sung lullabies") that maintains consistency. The perceptual signature—how Lira experiences exhaustion, perceives the postcard's pulse, feels the moss bloom—remains character-specific throughout. Rhythmic control especially strong in the final paragraph's cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled metaphor ("prismatic whispers," "iridescent mist") though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("labyrinthine archive"). The perceptual signature strengthens in moments like "The tubes sang, their voices a tapestry of old and new," showing distinct texture without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains scholarly precision appropriate to Elara's profession - "arcane linguist with ink-stained fingers and a mind like a labyrinth." The prose modulates effectively between technical description and emotional revelation. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext. However, Henrik's voice could be more distinct, and some phrases like "carefully reckless" feel forced rather than organic to the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistency through technical precision ("antique surveyor's chain coiled in her tool belt") and lyrical observation ("secrets waiting to be unlocked"). The perceptual signature—an engineer reading emotional patterns in physical residue—is distinct. Minor register drift occurs with "harmonize conflicting values" and occasional overwriting, but rhythm control under pressure succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies") and character-specific observations. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("blooming and withering all at once") that strains against Elias's established pragmatic courier perspective, particularly in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyrical register with controlled imagery like "fractured hush" and "featherly determined," though occasional drift into abstraction ("gaps between safety and the unknown") weakens immediacy. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature—focusing on patterns, codes, grain—stays consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara's perceptual signature as a "landscape astrologer" shapes her unique way of seeing patterns others miss. The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "shadowseam wonder." Some passages drift toward elevated register ("grand, chaotic symphony of existence") that slightly exceeds the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions fitting a "sea-foam recollectionist" perspective. The perceptual signature shows in how Lira translates everything into emotional textures ("viscous...like molasses"). No dialogue to evaluate. Some filter verb accumulation ("she saw," "she felt," "she believed") dulls immediacy in middle sections without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains analytical distance appropriate to Lira's character—"her analytical mind cataloging the reactions." Perceptual signature shows in how she reads the arcade as chessboard. Dialogue feels natural ("You're... ordering the chaos"). Minor weakness in occasional register elevation ("ephemeral sounds") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyric voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "obsidian grace" and "a darkness that shimmered like polished onyx," though it occasionally tips into purple prose. POV remains stable with Lirael, and her perceptual signature—attuned to gaps, pauses, fractures—distinguishes her perspective. Some register drift occurs with abstract concepts like "cosmic verse" that feel more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent contemplative register appropriate to Elara's reflective nature, with perceptual signature evident in how she notices light patterns and glass-like qualities in water. Prose rhythm modulates effectively between longer descriptive passages and shorter sensory moments. Some filter verb clusters ("she believed," "she thought," "she felt") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature of a scarred firefighter ("reading the land's breath, anticipating its rage") with controlled psychic distance shifts. Some elevated diction occasionally strains the POV ("celestial bodies pirouetted") but mostly maintains consistency. The narrative stance effectively modulates between memory and present observation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("altitude gauge," "calibrated," "vectors") balanced against poetic observation ("liquid mercury," "breath hitched"). The perceptual signature of a "logical dreamer" who charts and measures while seeking transcendence is distinct. Minor deduction for occasional drift toward elevated register ("liminal space," "latent power") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices textures "sensitively perceptive" and moves "as if tracing the spine of a forgotten map." Voice maintains consistency through stress, with controlled modulation during the walls' groaning. Some elevated diction ("ivy-veiled," "vaulted ceiling") fits the literary tone. Minor filter verb clusters ("she sensed," "she glimpsed") slightly dull immediacy in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains a lyrical register appropriate to the protagonist's artistic nature - "The echoing terrace in spring smelled of wet stone and jasmine." POV remains tightly controlled through Lirael's perceptions. The prose rhythm modulates effectively from calm opening to urgent climax when bells interrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, diplomatic diction befitting Elara's role ("operatively gentle," "fragile balance"). The brief dialogue exchange about the clipboard ("It's seen more peace than most men") carries appropriate subtext. However, the narrative occasionally drifts into elevated register ("languid arc," "testament to the fragile line") that, while atmospheric, occasionally obscures the immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains a controlled, literary distance appropriate to the philanthropist's calculating nature—"a stark contrast to the cracked earth beneath his boots." Perceptual signature shows in how he reads the landscape as economic opportunity while harboring secret sentiment. Minor repetition in structure ("He'd funded... He'd stolen... He'd commissioned") creates rhythm but borders on template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive phrasings like "between sigh and smile" and "liquid sunshine." POV remains stable in close third. However, register occasionally drifts into overly elevated diction ("fractured light," "archive of unspoken truths") that feels more authorial than character-driven, and some metaphors strain credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains an elevated literary register appropriate to an urbane calligrapher ("meteor hush," "serifed verses smooth as lies") with consistent POV control. Dialogue differentiates characters effectively—the drifter's skepticism, Mara's thoughtful engagement, Elias's measured responses. Some interiority tends toward the declarative ("Stories are thieves") rather than perceptual specificity, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with appropriate psychic distance. However, the prose frequently drifts into abstract philosophical register ("transiently rooted existence," "ephemeral monuments to the unseen") that feels more authorial than character-driven. No dialogue to evaluate, and the perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness beyond general poetic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled imagery ("green-gold veils," "rope coiled like a serpent"). POV remains stable with Kael's perceptual signature of technical gentleness despite scarred hands. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("void between stars"), but rhythm generally supports the meditative pace and mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to Mara's character, with controlled syntax like "whose foresight was matched only by her hindsight." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("transcended waking life," "nexus of decay and renewal") that strain against the intimate POV. The perceptual signature shows in selective details but loses specificity during peak moments, defaulting to conceptual language.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice combining scientific precision and poetic observation ("dusky harmony," "void's indifference"). Dialogue between Elara and the voice maintains appropriate register. Some filter verb accumulation ("She recognized," "She felt") dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice remains consistent with appropriate distance for third-limited, and Lirael's perception colors the sanctuary descriptions. Dialogue differentiates characters minimally—each visitor speaks with similar articulation despite different backgrounds. The prose maintains control but lacks distinctive texture; "sharp as flint and heart soft as moss" exemplifies the competent but conventional figurative language throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with phrases like "frost-kissed leaves" and "viscous liquid that smelled of midnight and memory." POV stays cleanly with Elias throughout. Slight elevation in register during mystical moments fits the genre without breaking character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, fairy-tale quality appropriate to the magical realist premise, with phrases like "quartz-eye mender" and "liquid starlight" creating texture. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("bridge generational wisdom") and some passages feel overwritten. Dialogue integration is smooth but limited to recalled speech.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's perceptual signature is distinct—she notices patterns that shift, feels voices in her bones, seeks philosophical breakthroughs in unusual spaces. Minor filter verb clusters ("she felt," "she realized") slightly dull immediacy in middle beats, though the voice maintains consistency through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision ("arcane linguist," "Old Thalassic") and some distinctive touches like "air hummed like a struck chord." Dialogue between Elara and the guardian feels functional. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("labyrinthine bookstore carved into the mountain's heart") that strains against the POV's naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voices for Lira (hopeful seeker) and Veyra (growl-hiss skeptic) with dialogue carrying subtext and goal pursuit. Some register drift in peak moments ("narrative threads," "symbiosis of chaos and order") that exceeds the POV's established lexicon. Clean free indirect style maintains consistent psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's scholarly voice maintains consistency through academic diction ("ceremonial rope," "schematics," "reconfigure") and her habit of connecting artifacts to larger patterns. The perceptual signature—noticing symbols, textures, and historical connections—stays character-specific throughout, though some phrases like "ghost's whisper" feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature focuses on sound-as-substance ("sound bent like light," "fossilized echo"). Voice modulates appropriately with intensity, though some moments drift toward elevated register ("hammered repose"). The single line of dialogue works effectively as ritual invocation. Minor inconsistency in describing energy beings shifts between "static" and "translucent forms."

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.7)
    Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature in how Elara experiences retrocognitive visions as flooding sensations and physical vibrations. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("fragile alchemy of hope and memory") that strains against the otherwise grounded voice, and dialogue remains minimal, limiting character distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Lirael's archivist perspective with selective perception ("pearl-like droplets," "poured milk"). The prose modulates effectively between observation and interiority. Some filter verb accumulation ("She realized," "Lirael realized," "understanding now") dulls immediacy in key moments, and occasional academic phrasing ("collective memory," "residual vibrations") could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on fire and light, and the chanting creates a distinct rhythmic texture. Some phrases feel overwrought ("velvet void, starless") and the shift to present tense in the final paragraph, while intentional, slightly disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    The POV maintains consistent close third with Elara, using free indirect style effectively: "Wasn't that what she and Kael were undergoing?" Dialogue feels natural with subtext - Kael's "What's your point?" carries curiosity beneath defensive tone. However, some interiority becomes overly explanatory, particularly the bracketed interpretations of the grotto's "quiet insistence."

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Lila's synesthetic collection of silence flavors. Some filter verb clusters ("she'd learned," "she'd heard") slightly dull immediacy. The father's voice stays consistent but minimal. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the trellis sequence, moving closer for sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elegance with controlled rhythm—"towers of crystal and obsidian that refracted the moonlight into liquid fractals." The perceptual signature focuses on sound and stillness appropriately, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("vaulting hush," "cocoon of possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent fantasy-literary register with controlled diction ("cathedral of shadows," "spectral guardian"), though it occasionally drifts toward elevated prose that doesn't fully match Lira's practical lore-keeper persona. The perceptual signature shows her scholarly attention to detail (tracing edges, studying murals), and the narrative distance remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception filtered through Elara's role as "tender shadow keeper." Dialogue carries subtext effectively (Kael's "You burned that bridge" works as both accusation and test). Some elevated diction ("metaphysical," "equilibrium") occasionally drifts from the established register. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of noticing shadows and thresholds is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Mara's survivor mentality ("knack for spotting lies," seeing Dr. Voss's "manic curiosity"). The glitchy text messages provide effective voice variation, though dialogue between Mara and Dr. Voss could carry more subtext beyond functional exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with appropriate psychic distance, using free indirect style effectively ("Listen," he seemed to say). The prose has distinct texture in phrases like "first yawn of evening" and "golden shadows deepened, stretching across the floor like liquid gold." However, some register shifts into elevated diction ("bridge of intuition between the past and whatever lay beyond the veil of her ignorance") don't fully align with Lirael's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice maintains gothic-fantasy register with controlled rhythm ("Factually mystical, he thought") and selective perception focused on alchemical details. Some moments drift toward overwrought ("shivering bliss prickled his skin") but generally the prose texture supports the uncanny atmosphere without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable with consistent focalization through Elias. Voice shows distinct texture in archival language ("cataloging the lives of children who'd slipped through society's cracks"). However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction inconsistent with character's embodied perspective, particularly in reflective passages about "language of neglect."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("steel vultures," water holding secrets). Dialogue differentiates characters adequately ("You're late" versus "Carefully resourceful, as always"). Some filter phrases ("Mara's mind raced," "she saw") dull immediacy during action beats, and vocabulary occasionally drifts toward generic thriller register.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled mystical vocabulary ("liminal space," "vested hush"), though some phrases lean purple ("ghost's whisper," "quietly vivid glow"). The perceptual signature focuses on moisture, light refraction, and sound/silence interplay, creating a distinct atmospheric voice despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature with Elinor's orderly perspective coloring every observation (seeds in "neat rows," "meticulously arranged"). Voice modulates effectively from routine precision to wonder. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance shifts are controlled, moving closer during the monument-building. Minor filter verb usage ("she believed," "she knew") doesn't significantly dull immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with technically-minded protagonist through specific diction (gears, solder, calibrate) and thought patterns that reflect a tinkerer's analytical mindset. POV control is stable throughout with no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately during action sequences, tightening during the waterfall plunge.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative phrasing like "molten gold that mirrored the zodiac coin" and character-specific perception. However, Lira's dialogue occasionally drifts into overly articulate territory for a spectral manifestation ("By exploring your limits. By admitting that some questions don't have answers"), creating mild register inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyrical register appropriate to the mystical subject matter. The spectral figure's "chorus of whispers" differentiates it from Lira's grounded perspective. Perceptual signature evident in how Lira notices spectral details through her collector's lens. Minor filter verb accumulation ("she heard," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent trauma-survivor perspective with effective perceptual signature ("every muscle twitch...echoed with the precision of a metronome set to chaos"). Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("halo of forgiveness"), and the woman's dialogue occasionally feels staged rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "tapestry of smoke" and "spiral staircase of mist." Perceptual signature evident in how Lira notices runes others can't decipher. Some register elevation ("eternal instant," "fractured histories") occasionally strains against the intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice shows some distinction in technical observation ("dust accumulation patterns—a swirl here, a ridge there") though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("their weightless burden pressing against his chest like a second skin"). The ghost's single line of dialogue feels natural. Perceptual signature of noticing patterns others miss is established but could be more consistently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains an elevated, consistent register appropriate to the fantastical setting ("prismatic volumes," "fractured rainbows"). However, some constructions feel overwrought ("a time when truths shifted like tides and memories frayed at the edges") and the voice occasionally drifts toward explanatory distance rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with baroque register matching the asteroid setting ("burnished sorrow," "palimpsest of erased voices"). POV remains stable with Kael's archaeological-poetic perception filtering everything. Some moments edge toward overwriting but generally the elevated diction serves the story's ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent philosophical-fantastical register with distinctive phrases like "infected by midnight" and "threads of spun starlight." Dialogue carries appropriate formality for the world while advancing plot through subtext. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("syrup of sound") that slightly strains the craftsman POV, and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice through specialized vocabulary ("petrichor collector," "psychometry reading") and Lira's particular way of perceiving ("hinged awakenings"), maintaining consistency through pressure. Some filter phrases ("Lira felt," "she realized") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "tasting like salt and iron," but dialogue lacks naturalism—the grandmother's "You're late" and "The alliances hold" read as cryptic exposition. The POV occasionally leaps to knowledge Lira shouldn't have, like understanding the slides are "covenants."

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("amber pavilion," "fiery confetti," "umbral tenderness"). The perceptual signature of an artist noticing light patterns and visual details remains strong. Minor register elevation in places ("liminal space between night and day") but largely coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency through Mara's archival perspective ("ink-stained fingers," attention to documents) and the prose rhythm accelerates appropriately during the tunnel sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Distinctive touches like "lanterns...flickered like half-forgotten dreams" and "spectral echoes of a ghost town revival" create atmospheric texture. Some phrases edge toward purple ("salt-laden air," "gaunt face") but serve the melancholic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature with Voss experiencing the garden through touch ("fingers tracing grooves") and sound (the phonograph's layers). The Old High Martian adds texture without becoming ornamental. Minor issues with register drift ("velvet disquiet" feels authorial) and the Chinese character insertion disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative descriptions like "sky like shattered glass" and "wings like fractured mirrors." The perceptual signature shows in selective details - Lirael notices spirals, textures, and entropy shifts. Some elevated diction ("harbinger," "atrium") occasionally strains against the intimate POV, and dialogue is minimal, limiting character distinction through speech.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with appropriate perceptual filtering ("her ears prick," "brow furrowing"). Dialogue between Lira and Veyra carries some subtext but trends toward exposition, particularly Veyra's explanatory lines.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("when the sky hung low and the stars burned so close"). Zara's perceptual signature filters cosmic events through spiritual metaphor ("tears from the heavens"). Dialogue between Zara and Veyra carries naturalistic tension, though limited exchanges prevent full voice distinction. Some elevated diction ("primal elegance") occasionally drifts from Zara's janitor perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance. Voice modulates effectively during the vision sequence and speaking moment. Some register elevation in phrases like "tangled covenant" and "tranquilly perceptive" that don't fully match Elias's decades of isolation, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the concept-driven narrative, with selective perception reflecting Elias's banker-turned-timekeeper lens ("numbers had changed meaning").

Some passages drift toward academic abstraction ("entropy," "syntactic uniformity") that slightly distances from embodied POV.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("The cobalt lagoon breathed softly") and character-specific perception focused on artistic transformation. Some register elevation ("burnished hush," "resonant reconfiguration") occasionally strains against the contemplative POV but generally serves the piece's meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception focused on botanical and architectural details. The spirit's dialogue ("Why?" "It hurts") contrasts effectively with Lira's measured tone. Some filter phrases ("Lira recalled," "She'd learned") slightly dull immediacy in non-critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature in "luminous skeptic with a mind sharper than the storm's edge" and controlled shifts during the reality-inversion sequence. Dialogue between Lirael and Kael carries appropriate subtext but occasionally drifts toward exposition ("The Enclave believes it can be bottled. I believe it can't."). Voice maintains consistency through the pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("twilight seeped," "roots seeking purchase"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization. The shift to elevated diction in reflective passages ("narrow vastness of hope") fits the coachman's learned background. Some register elevation in peak moments ("the space between breaths") but it's character-motivated through his linguistic expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent post-apocalyptic register ("wild hush," "resource war") with some evocative moments like "reading the silence." However, dialogue lacks distinction between speakers, and Hush's POV occasionally slips into omniscient territory ("She wanted to translate distance into closeness") without sufficient grounding in embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to Elio's scholarly background ("ferment without judgment," "temporally stretched perception") while modulating effectively during the apparition scene. The perceptual signature shows in how he notices astronomical and temporal details others might miss. Dialogue between Elio and his grandmother carries authentic subtext about legacy and understanding. Minor filter verb clustering in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception (noting constellations, chess piece details). Voice modulates appropriately with tension, shortening during the swap sequence. Some register drift into elevated fantasy prose ("icebound spire pierced the clouds") that doesn't fully match Kael's thief perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("spell *unbind* with her footsteps"), though occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("nomadic penumbra, that elusive state"). The perceptual signature—Elara reading the gallery's shifts as communication—stays distinct, and the modulation from whispers to silence tracks emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "shadows as sharp as knives" and controlled psychic distance. Mother's dialogue carries appropriate weight ("The stone isn't a map. It's a mirror"), though some passages lean toward elevated register that occasionally obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled imagery ("fierce repose," "woven hush"). The brief dialogue between young Alaric and the prince feels natural and advances the guilt that drives the story. Some filter phrases ("Alaric knew," "He saw") could be stronger, but overall the prose texture supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains poetic consistency with controlled rhythm ("towers of bone rose like crooked teeth"). Kael's dialogue carries subtext and advances his goals. Some register elevation in narration ("monolithic lies," "kaleidoscope") slightly exceeds his artist-rebel lexicon without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct voice through alchemical lexicon ("vials of liquid light, vials of shattered starlight") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during pressure moments. The statue's sudden speech feels slightly unmotivated, but overall POV consistency and perceptual signature (seeing patterns in quilts, acid, father's hands) maintain coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains an artistic sensibility fitting the painter protagonist - "sapphire paint," "pearlescent seashell." Some elevated diction ("intimately aloof," "unburdened by grief") occasionally drifts from the established register. The mother's dialogue lacks naturalism but functions symbolically.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "dawn bled gold into the bruised sky" and "whispers slip through cracks." The perceptual signature—Elara's attention to scents, vibrations, and subtle frequencies—stays coherent. Some elevated diction ("sentinel," "intoxicating") occasionally strains against the intimate register, and Thalos's dialogue feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "skeletal fingers" and "moon's breath," though some sections drift toward overwrought metaphor ("geography of loss"). The cryptic phone dialogue effectively uses indirection and subtext. Minor register drift in places where poetic diction overwhelms the character's practical navigator identity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting Mara's methodical nature, and the prose modulates appropriately during Jorn's panicked arrival. Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Not here," "The storm's coming"), though Mara's internal voice occasionally drifts into elevated register that doesn't match her practical character.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's voice maintains consistency with phrases like "brittle as moth wings" and "nest of silver and seaweed." The woman's dialogue ("He borrowed mine") carries appropriate weight. Minor filter verb accumulation ("Elias felt," "he knew") slightly dulls immediacy in places.

    Consistent close third POV with distinct perceptual signature in details like "wire-rimmed glasses" and map-dealer specificity. Dialogue between Lila and her father feels natural with subtext. Minor register elevation in places like "cartographer of her own heart" slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent royal register with moments of genuine texture ("cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise"). The light-being's dialogue achieves an appropriately otherworldly tone, though the queen's responses occasionally flatten into generic protest rather than maintaining her established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled technical vocabulary ("prismatic lens," "logarithmic curl") that fits the alchemist POV. Dialogue carries subtext effectively—Jorin's "And if you can't?" conveys concern without stating it. Minor convergence in emotional peaks and some filter-verb reliance ("she realized her mistake").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("feral nostalgia," "liminal space between breaths") and consistent first-person retrospective stance that matches a chronicler's sensibility. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to written artifacts and temporal markers. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("green-eyed monster," "bittersweet clarity") slightly exceeds the established lexicon without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's perceptual signature—tracing edges, feeling history "like a phantom scent"—creates distinct voice. The prose modulates from meditative observation to focused discovery. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("vessel of fear, pride, and relief") that doesn't fully match a repair shop owner's natural diction, and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled mystical register and selective perception (ink like "liquid starlight," mist "pooled like spilled milk"). Some filter-verb clusters ("He realized," "he feared," "he knew") slightly dull immediacy. The italicized mentor quotes effectively punctuate the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara's voice as a cynical professional who thinks in metaphors ("regret was her currency") is distinctive. The narrative maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Lila's accusatory "You left me here in the silence."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    The elevated register maintains consistency with mystical language ("resounding hush," "spiral arbitration") that matches the cosmic scope, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose. The POV remains stable in third-limited following the Witness. Dialogue from the mural figures ("To see the truth, you must first see yourself") carries appropriate weight but lacks naturalistic texture. The narrative voice modulates effectively during the vision sequence, shifting to "vast, star-strewn expanse."

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong perceptual signature through Lorn's selective attention to mechanical details and temporal phenomena. The lyrical register suits the contemplative tone, though occasional elevated diction ("eminently peculiar") slightly strains the working-class POV.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with technical precision befitting an intrusion specialist, using terms like "fractal patterns" and "oscillations." Some register drift occurs with phrases like "smooth as mycelium threading through soil" that feel authorial rather than character-driven. Dialogue between Kael and Lira carries appropriate subtext about trust and fear.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong perceptual signature with Clara's probability-inflected observations ("probability curves," "theoretical rebellion") and consistent focus on patterns and contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent control with phrases like "the subway's breath echoes through concrete veins" establishing distinct texture. The perceptual signature stays grounded in Mara's underground perspective, though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("melodically haunted souls").

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and lyric touches like "the horizon a bruise of violets and gold." The perceptual signature shows in selective details - an archivist notices edges, frames, preservation methods. Some filter verbs ("she wondered," "she thought") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voices emerge—Elias's "desperate, jocular bark" versus Lira's sharp precision ("That's the catalyst"). The conductor's layered whispers and Lira's "Polite anarchy wins again" maintain character-specific registers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature filtering everything through touch, vibration, and non-visual sensation. The prose rhythm modulates with the forest's frequencies. Minor filter-verb clustering ("seemed to say") and some register elevation ("celestial hush") that doesn't fully match Elias's grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("celestial signal interpreter," "optimize") shifting to more philosophical registers during Lira's teaching. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I edit the *why* of things"). Some filter verb clustering ("Elias saw," "he thought") and occasional register elevation ("the strange comfort of the anomaly lingered") create minor friction but don't break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and carries a contemplative rhythm that matches the story's meditative subject. Dialogue between Kael and Lira effectively mixes signing and speech to advance plot. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liquid silver," "symphony of stillness") that feels slightly performative rather than emerging from Kael's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "volcanic tenderness" enacted through prose rhythm. The perceptual signature shows in how Mara reads brushstrokes and architectural responses. Some register elevation ("tactile memory of paper and ink") occasionally drifts from character grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    The unmotivated POV shift from third to first person mid-story is a critical failure that disrupts narrative coherence. Before the shift, voice shows promise with phrases like "the hush of the universe inhaling," but consistency breaks completely. The sudden "I" appears without transition or purpose, suggesting either error or uncontrolled experimental impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistency through technical vocabulary (quadrants, containers, valves) appropriate to Elias's profession, with perceptual focus on sounds and vibrations fitting his theory. Dialogue remains minimal but functional ("Which way?" / "Not long enough"). However, some passages drift into elevated register ("talisman," "creak and echo") that doesn't fully align with a maintenance worker's internal lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("her presence a shadow without a voice"). POV remains stable in limited third, and the perceptual signature—Lira's way of seeing patterns in light—is consistent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with effective compression ("the hush where past meets prophecy lingered like a breath held too long"). Clara's perceptual signature—hearing unspoken words—shapes narration distinctly. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("magnetic grotto," "cobalt library") but serves the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Lira's perspective, with controlled rhythm in passages like "She treaded water, laughing through her tears." However, some abstract declarations ("someone free," "true nature") lack the perceptual specificity that would ground the POV more firmly in Lira's particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lirael's flat affect creates a distinctive narrative texture with controlled psychic distance, the monotone performance voice contrasting with philosophical depth. The performative framing ("Today, I will carve a spoon") establishes purposeful distance, and diction remains consistent with her blank-faced persona, though some passages ("Joy is a Choice!") feel slightly external to her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("lantern-moth hush," "liquid glass"). However, register occasionally drifts elevated beyond Lirael's established lexicon ("the sacred and the profane"), and no dialogue tests character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias's perceptual signature as a colorblind painter shapes the narrative texture, with descriptions emphasizing gray/beige seeing "vibrancy where others saw void." Dialogue between Elias and Marla carries subtext about deeper magic, though Marla's voice occasionally drifts into overly articulate exposition ("The phoenix was dying. Its fire needed fuel") that doesn't match her established wry character.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception like "each fiber catching the dim light like a whisper" and character-specific diction. The prose modulates effectively between technical precision ("equations that shimmered faintly") and sensory immersion. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("powerfully gentle" appears multiple times), but overall the voice serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the mourning jewelry maker's perspective, with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to light, shadow, and craftsmanship details. However, some passages drift into elevated literary diction ("ardor," "atonement") that feels slightly removed from embodied character experience, and the prose occasionally tells emotional states rather than rendering them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent mystical-analytical register appropriate to Elara's hybrid role. Perceptual signature strong: "She'd learned to confide in the silence here, to let the loft's inherited mystery seep into her bones." Dialogue differentiates characters adequately. Some filter verb accumulation ("she explained," "she said") slightly dulls immediacy in teaching sequences but doesn't break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated register with phrases like "saffron-veil historian" and "atoms of nostalgia," creating atmospheric texture. Dialogue between Lirael and Kael carries some subtext about fear versus curiosity. However, both characters speak in similar registers despite different stances, and Kael's voice lacks distinction ("That's what they called it" could be either character).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with deliberate, observational prose fitting Lirael's character. Dialogue between Lirael and Thalos carries appropriate weight though occasionally veers toward exposition ("The dream-sharing network isn't just for sharing dreams. It's for sharing *time*").

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with selective perception focused on delicate details ("forceps, a magnifying glass, a vial of biodegradable adhesive"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively, slowing during reconstruction and quickening at emotional peaks. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("hinge in time") that slightly exceeds Lira's established lexicon, and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with moments like "meteor hush" and "the tunnel twisted." However, the plant whispers (*They know*, *Follow the rings*) feel artificially inserted. POV remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond poetic description.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style during visions. Some register elevation during emotional peaks ("the theater of light where love went to die") that slightly strains the established voice. Perceptual signature clear in how Mara experiences the world as "a lattice of memories."

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with "eyes like fractured galaxies" and "moonstruck dreamer" establishes lyric register consistently. POV maintains control through sensory immersion ("air tasted of ozone and old paper"), though occasional elevation ("the aurora's rage") slightly exceeds Kael's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "cataloging flickers like a librarian of lost fire" and selective attention to luminescence. Dialogue occasionally slips into exposition ("It's a charm, a key to the unlit corners") but maintains subtext about Kael's unique position. POV holds steady though some passages drift toward omniscient certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains philosophical-poetic register appropriate to Elara's wandering philosopher identity, though some passages drift toward overwrought ("ghostly whirring," "primordial chaos"). Perceptual signature shows in how she processes the forest musically and mechanically simultaneously. Brief dialogue from the father-hologram carries appropriate synthesis of "wind and machinery."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains a consistent mythic-lyric register appropriate to the fable-like narrative. Lira's dialogue carries weight and wisdom ("The ridgeway reveals itself to those who listen, not those who demand"), while Jorin's questions feel naturally younger. The narration's selective perception focuses on magical transformations and philosophical moments. Some passages edge toward elevated diction that slightly distances from immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register with controlled elevation ("shadow's breath," "seraphically mundane"). POV control is stable throughout with appropriate access to Elric's interiority. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("cobalt-infused salves and whispered hymns") and the somewhat artificial precision of descriptions like "the third night of the new moon."

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and mythic register appropriate to the fantasy setting. Distinctive touches like "diminutive titan" and "star trapped in her chest" create texture. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative (library research) to active (the confrontation). Limited dialogue ("Behold the truth") serves its purpose without feeling forced, though more varied sentence structures could enhance rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's tapping creates a distinct perceptual signature and the prose modulates effectively between scientific observation and mystical revelation. However, register drift appears in elevated abstractions like "mosaic of grief" and "periodically eternal dark" that clash with the established scientific POV, and Kael's minimal dialogue prevents voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's perceptual signature is distinct—she notices hums others miss, sees patterns in stones dismissed as decor. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative ("Silence was a lie") to urgent command ("Now!"). Minor dialogue stiffness ("Use it how?") prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinct voice - Nana's perspective colors descriptions ("like a cauldron left on the stove"). The free indirect style works well ("This was her chance"). Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match a 72-year-old insurgent's likely lexicon ("night-blooming cereus," "chlorophyll").

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with selective perception filtered through Lila's trauma-affected consciousness. Diction matches her artistic background ("painting wedding invitations," "bold and sure" strokes). Mrs. Voss's dialogue carries distinct wisdom-elder cadence. Some filter verbs appear but serve the dissociative PTSD experience ("she'd begun to believe").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency through Elias's artist-philosopher perspective, with selective perception focused on visual and tactile details. The rhetorical questions function as character trait rather than affectation. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent as pressure builds, though some philosophical abstractions ("fragments," "half-truths") could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception fitting a tracker ("bleached bone," "earth-toned tents"). Dialogue between Lira and the child feels natural with appropriate subtext. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "consciously wild intuition" that doesn't fully match established diction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with formal, archival tone appropriate to Lirael's role ("guardian of a thousand years' worth of frozen truths"). Some effective modulation occurs under pressure. However, Kael's immediate coherent speech after a century frozen strains credibility, and both characters' dialogue lacks distinct registers despite vastly different temporal origins.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "mosaic of shattered rhythms" and character-specific perception ("senselessly perceptive to the farm's whispers"). Some passages achieve excellent rhythm control ("The blade, once used to sever, now served to plant") while others accumulate abstractions that slightly distance us from Lira's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinctive voice balances technical precision ("frequency emitter," "transliterate emotions") with lyrical imagery ("lullaby sung by wolves"), maintaining Kael's scientific-mystical perspective throughout. Some filter verbs in observation sections slightly dull immediacy but don't compromise the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with clear focalization through Clara. Dialogue distinguishes characters effectively (journalist's urgency vs. mother's emotion). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgency ("orbits of regret," "dance in their gravity"), and some interiority feels explanatory rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with distinctive touches like "her needle a silver quill against the canvas of flesh" and controlled psychic distance. However, Elara's dialogue tends toward exposition ("The firmware's haunted by the scientists who encoded their guilt into it"), and the shift into the digital labyrinth lacks sufficient perceptual grounding to maintain POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with artistic perception ("ephemeral galaxies," "whispering gallery") and selective noticing aligned with Mara's chalk artist identity. The italicized whispers effectively distinguish the grotto's communication. Minor weakness in occasional register elevation ("profound, almost sacred silence") that slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "vendors laughing, children chasing pigeons." The retrocognitive shifts are handled cleanly without confusion. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from Elias's established voice ("testament to the aberrant mercy that had become his creed"), and some constructions feel written rather than perceived.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism: "his form flickering like old film, trailing the scent of violets and forgotten melodies." The synesthetic perception creates a unique perceptual signature throughout. Dialogue is minimal but effective—the flapper's "You're... earlier" and "Again" carry weight through implication rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's voice shows distinct texture in specialized vocabulary ("fractally precise facets," "somatic markers") and maintains consistency. Dialogue carries some subtext and character differentiation. However, register occasionally drifts into academic explanation ("adverse synaptic rewiring"), and Mara's voice lacks the same specificity as Elias's, creating imbalance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent blend of scientific precision ("pendant-sized heat-mapper") with lyrical perception ("liminal silence where the ocean's breath replaced"). POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated diction in emotional peaks ("palimpsest of emotions") fits Lira's educated perspective, though occasionally strains naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative diction ("unearthed silence," "amber light pulsed") that matches the mythic register. Some passages show syntactic monotony with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions, and the perceptual signature could be more distinctive to Mara specifically rather than generically poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through spy-specific awareness ("read the silence between heartbeats," paranoia keeping her alive) with controlled modulation during memory sequences. Voice maintains consistency through literary register appropriate to the character, though some phrases edge toward writerly display ("liminal space," "benediction").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with contemplative, literary register appropriate to Thaddeus's philosophical nature. Perceptual signature shows in his attention to vibrations, rhythms, and ambient details. Some repetitive phrasing ("closely attentive" appears verbatim twice) and the absence of dialogue limits voice demonstration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains zen-potter perspective through phrases like "mind like still water" and methodical observation patterns. Some elevated diction ("scorched wasteland," "skeletal hives") fits the contemplative tone but occasionally drifts toward writerly. The perceptual signature of tracing light patterns is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception ("calloused hands," focus on small details of persistence). The prose rhythm modulates appropriately from contemplative to active. Brief dialogue feels natural with subtext. However, some phrases like "wistfully pragmatic understanding" and "luminous harbor by moonlight" occasionally drift toward writerly construction over authentic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with controlled rhythm in passages like "woolly rhinos, dodo birds, and her own ancestors, their forms dissolving like smoke." POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of noticing extinction and transformation is distinct. Some filter phrases ("Lirael realized," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy in crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Lila's interiority with phrases like "her chest tightened" and "tears pricking her eyes." Elara's dialogue has a distinct whimsical register ("curator? Guide? It depends on the day"). Some passages drift toward elevated literary diction that doesn't fully match Lila's professional background.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic/technical register appropriate to the protagonist. Some effective moments ("wind chimes made of starlight") but dialogue lacks subtext - Professor Hale's lines are purely functional without character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("the shadowed nexus under starlight swallowing him whole"). However, several instances of elevated diction feel disconnected from Elias's established voice ("spatial mutiny," "wistful rebellion"), and internal thoughts occasionally explain rather than embody ("Was this a test? A trick?").

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature through Clara's texture-focused observation compensating for face-blindness. Dialogue between Clara and Voss feels natural with appropriate subtext. Minor register drift in moments like "the quarry's hush following them like a benediction" that elevates beyond the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV through Clara with appropriate psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in how Clara notices margins and faded ink as a map librarian would. The brief dialogue with the director feels natural and advances plot. Some filter verb accumulation ("Clara wondered," "she knew") dulls immediacy in places but doesn't overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias's POV maintains consistency with selective perception ("dynamically observant") filtering details like wind patterns and shadow shifts. Voice modulates effectively during the fiddle-playing sequence with accelerated syntax. Marisol's dialogue shifts believably from "rusted hinges" to "polished stone," though her expository final lines ("It's not just a map—it's a choice") feel overly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture—prose reads competent but generic. Heavy reliance on abstract interiority ("he wondered if his father had been right") over embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with selective perception fitting a dream chronicler ("light bending through dimensions only dreamers could perceive"). Some register elevation in places ("celestial mapping observatory clung...like a silver moth trapped in amber") that slightly exceeds the character's established voice. Dialogue is minimal but functional with appropriate subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with nature-focused imagery fitting a druid's perspective ("bark-rough hands," organic metaphors). POV remains stable in close third. Some filter phrases ("She saw herself," "Mira waited") slightly dull immediacy during key moments, and the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("warlike serenity") that doesn't fully match Mira's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("time pooled like spilled ink"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature—Lirael notices through touch and physical sensation. Dialogue between Lirael and her double carries subtext about fear and acceptance, advancing the internal conflict naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm ("Her bones nourish the soil"), though occasional register drift appears ("residual energy," "diagnostic pose"). Dialogue carries appropriate mystical weight but sometimes explains rather than dramatizes ("Your past is ash, but from ash, new growth rises").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lenny's perceptual signature shows in how he catalogs objects ("faux-Tiffany lamp as 'Victorian era'") and shields himself with facts. Internal voice maintains consistency through roadie vernacular and appraisal terminology. Dialogue between Lenny and Gus feels natural with subtext ("Looks like a dish towel"), though the bassist conversation summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent scholarly-mystical register appropriate to Elara's character, with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the seed's transformation. The perceptual signature focuses on patterns and connections ("spirals," "magnetic currents," "analogical thinking"). Some filter-heavy passages ("She realized then," "Elara believed") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("After tomorrow disappeared—when the world's clocks had all melted into saltwater") and consistent POV through the librarian's perspective. Some phrases like "titan-gear automaton" and dialogue ("Fear is a tide. It recedes.") feel slightly mannered but maintain coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the material, with distinctive perceptual signatures ("a light that wasn't light—a hum beneath the rocks"). Some passages drift into elevated diction that strains the POV ("latent radiance," "resonant hush"), and the narrative occasionally tells what could be shown ("He realized the shell wasn't just a record—it was a key").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Mara's chronicler lens ("patched with electrical tape and weather-stained"). The prose modulates effectively between clinical observation and raw emotion, though occasional phrases like "festering and bloomed" feel slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on light patterns and temporal anomalies fitting Lira's quest. Some register elevation appears ("ghostly serpents," "veiled dreamer") but generally serves the atmospheric tone without breaking POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira's perceptual signature shines through botanical awareness ("accidentally telepathic with plants") and her provenance researcher's attention to objects' histories. The voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm: "The stain bloomed across the porcelain, a Rorschach test of possibility." No dialogue appears, appropriately for this interior piece.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"her voice a whisper swallowed by the radiant hush." POV remains stable in close third. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("latent magic," "pure potentiality") that slightly exceeds character lexicon during action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with contemplative, slightly elevated register appropriate to Lirael's caretaker role. Perceptual signature shows in how she reads the grotto's details. Dialogue between sisters feels natural with appropriate subtext. Minor deduction for occasional drift into overly literary phrasing ("umbral grotto," "vineyard hush") that doesn't fully integrate.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong perceptual signature in how Elias processes through sound and texture ("hummed in his grip," parsing chime tones). Dialogue carries effective subtext, especially "Doubt doesn't keep a schedule." Minor convergence in voice when both characters use similar registers during emotional peaks weakens distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice through phrases like "sycamore hush" and "honey through the patterns" creates consistent texture. POV maintains Elara's perspective with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("fractal patterns," "resonant reconfiguration") that slightly exceeds the established mystical-poetic range.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to the world, with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on patterns and echoes. Phrases like "harmonic stone skimmer" and "pulse left wandering" create distinctive texture. Some repetitive structures appear ("Kael had...", "He had...") but generally the voice coheres around the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with fantasy register appropriate to the genre, though lacks distinctive perceptual signature. Phrases like "weathered stone archway etched with runes that pulsed like a heartbeat" feel genre-typical rather than character-specific, and some constructions ("brilliant dimness," "lingering luminance") strain for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled metaphor ("meteor hush," "skeleton finger"). POV stays grounded in Elias's perception. Some elevated diction ("coalescing into a swirl") slightly exceeds a lamplighter's natural lexicon but supports the magical realist tone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature: Kael experiences the cosmos through tactile interaction with coins and console, not visual sweep. Voice maintains consistency through technical-mystical register appropriate to the character. Minor slip: "quietly enthusiastic" appears twice verbatim, suggesting template insertion rather than organic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled syntax and selective perception (focusing on decay, light, mechanical details). The italicized echoes and questions create effective texture. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("amber light of dusk," "distant intimacy") but generally serve the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent earnestness through Elias's perceptual signature of seeing puzzles where others see futility, with dialogue carrying naturalistic skepticism from Marla ("You're mad"). Some register elevation occurs in descriptive passages ("bridge of frozen light") that slightly exceeds Elias's likely lexicon, though the rhythmic control during the calibration sequence effectively mirrors the dripping tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong perceptual signature in Mara's warden-trained observation ("scanned the water's surface for cracks") modulating to memory-haunted recognition. The woman's dialogue carries some exposition weight but "You've always been vigilant. Now you need to be something else" lands with subtext. Minor voice convergence when both women speak in similar registers despite different backgrounds.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (alchemist noticing crystal's hum others can't hear). Some elevated diction ("fractured light," "liquid stained glass") fits the fantastical setting. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully integrate with Elara's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on patterns and technical details ("binary switches," "fractal light"). Some passages achieve strong rhythm, particularly action sequences. However, occasional filter constructions ("he knew," "he understood") and explanatory interiority dilute immediacy during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction - Kael's interiority could belong to any fantasy protagonist. Dialogue serves its purpose but "You're obsolete...I'm the future" reads generic. The narrative maintains third-limited cleanly but without memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature as a puzzle-designer shapes descriptions ("his mind remained a labyrinth of curiosity"). The prose modulates effectively between technical investigation and lyrical moments, though some phrases like "storm-born silence" feel slightly elevated beyond the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "the unspoken finding voice through his efforts." POV remains stable in close third. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory with constructions like "mournfully eager expression never wavering," and the lack of dialogue means we miss opportunities for voice distinction and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice blends feral physicality with lyrical abstraction ("liminal hour," "interiorizing exteriors"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively—the cultist's "You invite it" reveals understanding while pursuing opposed goals. Some register elevation in peak moments ("dimensionally homesick") slightly strains the feral guardian's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice emerges through selective perception (alchemist noticing silver's resistance, ivory's hum) and controlled rhythm that accelerates during the vivification sequence. Some register elevation appears ("grotesque question mark," "smog-choked sky") but generally serves the fantasy setting; dialogue functions well as haunting memory rather than present conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "serenely electric static" and "mosaic of shattered glass and circuitry." Some elevated diction ("spectral fingers," "labyrinth of steel") occasionally drifts from Kael's technical mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("night when clocks ran sideways") and consistent POV control. The perceptual signature shows in how Kael processes the supernatural through physical details—"fingers tightened," "antenna trembling." Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("spectral grotto beneath a sky thick with liquid starlight") that slightly exceeds a deckhand's natural lexicon during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("liquid fractals," "fever dream architect") and controlled psychic distance. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("rational enchantment," "texture of connection") that feels more conceptual than lived. The curator's dialogue carries appropriate mystery but borders on exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate register for an instructor-protagonist, and Tarel's dialogue feels natural. However, the narration lacks distinct perceptual signature - descriptions like "somber marvel" and "faint glow" could belong to any contemplative narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance. Lila's perceptual signature shows in details like "mist curling around her ankles like spectral cats." Dialogue between Lila and the widow feels natural with appropriate subtext, though the spectral man's "Assure her I loved her" is somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Lira's specific way of noticing ("skeletal map of dried seaweed," "star trapped in amber"). Voice maintains consistency through technical observations filtered by emotional urgency. Some register elevation occurs in explanatory passages ("electromagnetic field") that slightly strains the established voice. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (counting heartbeats, seeing patterns in ink). Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("midnight solace of existence") slightly strains the POV's established lexicon. Dialogue with OBS-7 effectively carries subtext about system versus human logic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature with copper-veined skin and synesthetic perception ("translate texture into sound"). Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm: "The canyon itself was a throat of endless echoes." The POV remains stable with appropriate narrative certainty, though peak moments occasionally drift toward elevated register ("a geometry of vibrations") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through scientific observation ("moss-caked roots") shifting to embodied sensation ("hands clawed, back arched like a bow"). Voice modulates effectively under transformation pressure. Dialogue carries subtext well ("They're restless tonight"), though limited quantity prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "resonantly soft" and "liquid starlight" that match the enchanted setting. POV remains stable in close third, with Lira's perceptions filtering the fantastical elements. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("bled gold through the trees") but rhythm generally supports the mystical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled metaphors ("twilight's bruise," "wound stitched with light") and character-specific perception. POV remains stable with Elias's selective attention to borders, gaps, and connections. Prose rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative passages and the storm's explosive arrival, though occasional filter phrases ("Elias watched," "he wondered") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in phrases like "whispering gleam" and "misting hush of forgotten dreams." POV remains stable in close third, with Elio's selective perception filtering details appropriately. Some phrasing edges toward purple ("eternal, silent race"), and the elevated diction occasionally strains against the character's humble carpenter identity, but overall coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor's perceptual signature is distinct—she notices "raised threads," thinks in terms of "analog memories," and perceives books as "living things." The prose modulates effectively from measured observation to heightened awareness during the transformation. The dialogue between Eleanor and the patron feels natural with appropriate subtext about impossibility, though the internal poem's diction doesn't quite match Eleanor's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm - "In the hush of improbable beginnings, when the world still tasted of salt." The dream's dialogue "You've been chasing me, but I've been chasing you" maintains subtext. Some register elevation in "vitalized through the lens" and "liminal hours" that occasionally drifts from character-grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical-literary register with controlled distance, using selective perception ("his eyes burned with quiet intensity") and atmospheric filtering. The narrative stance holds steady through the reality shift. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("the hush of cosmic possibility"), but overall the voice supports the story's aims with distinct texture in word choice and rhythm that modulates during the unlocking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature through Elias's folklorist lens ("measuring tides, sketching fungal growths, muttering... about 'forgotten thresholds'") with controlled psychic distance. Minor register drift occurs in philosophical moments ("When habits break... the past whispers loudest"), but voice remains largely consistent through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signatures (backwards walking, tea-leaf geometry, shadow patterns). Dialogue between Lirael and the woman feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some filter-verb clustering ("she felt a restlessness") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't compromise closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with controlled diction like "verdant parapet" and "liquid gold." Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads the orchard through a pruner's expertise. Some elevated diction ("insatiably creative," "fracture in the air") occasionally strains against the folktalke tone but doesn't break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent mystical-literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in "Each knot held a fragment of a voice, a laugh, a sob, all muffled by time." Elias's riddle-speak ("A key to a door that was never locked") fits his characterization, though some passages drift toward abstract meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature through Elias's map-framer lens: "borders where others saw blankness," perceiving the tear as "threshold" not divide. Some register elevation in peak moments ("methodology curious," "resonant reconfiguration") slightly strains the established voice, though the overall texture remains distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive academic voice with controlled scientific diction ("entropy and wavefunction collapse") that reflects Elara's physicist perspective. The perceptual signature is consistent—she notices frequencies, patterns, decay rates. Some register elevation in emotional moments ("quiet, analytic ache") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with inventive phrases like "tinkersong wonder" and "charcoal stick dipped in moonlight," creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, though occasional overwriting ("driftingly alert" used twice) slightly dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's voice shows distinct perception ("sparkled like starlight," "ink into paper"), and the elevated register fits the atmospheric setting. Dialogue between Mara and widow carries appropriate subtext and formality. However, voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("wore grief like a second skin"), and the sudden shift to colloquial "You're clever for a servant" jars against established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation befitting an educated meteorologist, with specialized vocabulary ("wind shear," "pressure fronts," "updrafts") feeling natural. Dialogue between Lila and Voss carries subtext about belief versus skepticism without becoming overtly philosophical. Some filter phrases ("Lila's breath caught") and repetitive constructions ("She adjusted... She scribbled... She gestured") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through Lira's face-blindness shaping how she processes the world ("memorized souls through textures and hues"). Some filter verb clusters ("she saw," "she'd intended") slightly dull immediacy. Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though brief moments of elevated diction ("silent hymn to limits overcome") slightly strain the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent apprentice perspective with appropriate lexicon ("ink-stained fingers," "mind that hummed"). Dialogue differentiates characters effectively - Jax's gruffness versus Lira's precision. The narrative stance holds through the fantastical leap without breaking POV bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a craftsman (noting buttons, fabric, mechanical details). Prose rhythm varies appropriately, though some filter constructions ("he felt," "he knew") slightly distance during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register but lacks distinct perceptual signature. Elara's ghostly perspective doesn't meaningfully alter how events are perceived. The settlers' dialogue is minimal and undifferentiated, missing opportunities for voice distinction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("measured steps of someone who knew the weight of seconds"). Some elevated diction fits the mythic tone though occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature consistent, though dialogue absence prevents full assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature in how Kael notices decay ("bruised sky," "veins beneath") and interprets the birds' mechanical nature. Voice modulates effectively under pressure with shorter, more urgent sentences during the rescue. The single line of dialogue "Go" carries appropriate urgency, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct scientific voice with polymer/chemistry lens coloring perception ("surfactants swirled," "symphonically minded"). Some filter verb clustering ("she realized," "she thought") dulls immediacy in places. Dialogue is minimal but naturalistic when present.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent ethereal register with controlled diction like "incise the void" and "glimmering parole." The perceptual signature focuses on absences and potentials fitting Elara's role. Dialogue between Elara and the hooded man carries appropriate formality and subtext about creation's risks.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Nessar's perceptual signature—tasting memories in condensation, feeling drawn to forbidden spaces—creates a distinct voice, and the prose modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent when the guard approaches. The narrative maintains clean focalization through Nessar's sensory-driven POV, though some passages like "stored remorse, he knew, pooled here" feel slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical flourishes appropriate to the fairy-tale register. The multilingual element adds texture though the actual foreign phrases are told rather than shown. Some phrases like "vigorous tenderness" and "harmonize a dissonant choir" feel overwrought but fit the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to the "helix-minded engineer" POV. Perceptual signature is distinct ("fractal patterns," "chaotically precise"). Some filter verbs ("he realized," "seemed to") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira's scholarly voice maintains consistency through precise observations and academic language like "kaleidoscope of overlapping timelines." The prose modulates effectively during the gravity inversion with shorter, more visceral sentences. Some phrases feel overwrought ("prism-minded," "serpentine grotto in mist") and occasional filter verbs ("felt the world tilt") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with musical metaphors threading throughout ("symphony," "chord," "resonator"). However, register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's established lexicon ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") creating mild distance. Perceptual signature focuses appropriately on tactile/vibrational rather than auditory sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains scholarly precision filtered through mystical experience ("Thoughtfully precise," "silence that speaks in stones"). Free indirect style works well in the memory sequence. The star-mage's omnidirectional voice creates appropriate otherworldliness. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match Alaric's established lexicon ("celestial alignment that would eclipse the sun and moon simultaneously").

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("cobwebs clung," "static of unspoken things"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the humming sequence. However, occasional register drift appears ("intuitively descriptive," "catalog the varieties") that feels writerly rather than character-driven. The grandmother's diary voice distinguishes itself briefly but could differentiate more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance and sensory-filtered perception fitting an herbalist. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("At the turning of the tide's thought") that feels artificially literary rather than organic to Lira's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice maintains an exploratory, wonder-tinged quality appropriate to the pilot-discoverer. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("vine-woven glider," "liquid spheres that glowed faintly") fits the otherworldly setting, though occasional explanatory moments slightly flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains professional precision appropriate to an investigator—"documenting airspeed and direction"—with occasional lyric touches like "silence had settled like a second skin." The shift to more ominous register in the climax supports the genre turn, though some phrases like "the machine was hungry" edge toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lira's synesthetic perception creates a distinct voice ("silence pooled like indigo ink"), with consistent focalization. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and character distinction, though Veyra's voice could differentiate more sharply from Lira's register in places.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("gilded reed flute from its oilskin wrapper") and character-specific diction. The phrase "avalanchingly quiet" demonstrates purposeful compression that pays off thematically. Dialogue between Kael and the specter carries subtext about teaching methods. Minor issue: "avalanchingly quiet" appears twice with identical phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's analytical nature, with distinctive phrases like "stars bled into the horizon" and "lucid turbulence." POV control stays clean through the merger sequence despite perspective shift. Some filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") during peak pressure slightly dull immediacy, and dialogue could carry more subtext beyond direct statements.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong atmospheric voice with consistent POV filtering through Kail's jittery perception ("clicking faintly," "nerves already frayed"). The mysterious woman's dialogue carries appropriate cryptic weight. Minor weakness in the epiphany section where internal voice becomes slightly more articulate than established character baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains mystical specificity ("commune with the earth," "read the silence") with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the vision sequence. Some filter-heavy passages ("She realized, with a sickening lurch") and the slightly generic "mind at peace" ending prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with some lyrical texture ("where sunlight dripped through leaves like liquid gold"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction inconsistent with Mara's perspective ("suffocating hush that smothered laughter"). No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature could be more distinct to Mara's weaver-specific way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with measured, deliberate prose matching Jorin's character. Dialogue between Jorin and Lira feels stilted and expository ("Why do you trespass?" "Veyra dies"). The narrative voice works best in descriptive passages but loses naturalism in character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong perceptual signature through the sensory map maker's visor creates a distinct way of seeing ("translated the echoes of a thousand universes into light"). Voice maintains consistency through technical precision and measured introspection. Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Not exactly. But I've been waiting for you").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent maritime gruffness filtered through Elias's perspective with selective details like noticing "the pattern of rust on the iron railing." The prose modulates effectively from practical observation to lyrical moments like "the ache of the dark remained, but now it was luminescent," though occasional filter phrases slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-contemporary register with distinctive touches like "accidentally discovered its prophetic nature" and "total internal reflection." The perceptual signature—focusing on light, shadow, and prophetic fragments—stays coherent. Minor weakness: some moments edge toward overwrought ("restless gods"), though this mostly serves the heightened tone.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary elevation with controlled rhythm and selective perception that reflects Lin's watchful nature. The prose modulates effectively during the wing's light display, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("tiny, angry star"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance for Lin's contemplative character.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's perceptual signature is distinct—he notices technical details like "brass gears rusted," feels textures precisely, and interprets the tower's language of "fractures." The prose maintains consistent psychic distance and POV control, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("mundane miracle of his existence") slightly outside a maintenance worker's natural lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with phrases like "time pooled like mercury" and controlled rhythm throughout. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("conduit for the forgotten songs") that slightly exceeds Lira's established perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive touches like "pulsed in her mind" and selective perception filtered through grief. Dialogue carries appropriate formality for the secret society setting with subtext, though some interior moments drift toward elevated register ("enlarged tranquility wrapped around her like a cloak") that slightly exceeds Eleanor's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "heuristically gentle" and "creeping normality" establishing Elias's analytical perspective. The perceptual signature shows in how he notices patterns others miss, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("liminal space," "tenuous absolution") slightly beyond his established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent, controlled voice with distinctive perceptual signature ("quartz hush," "bleaching like old ink") that reflects Elara's orderly precision. Focalization remains stable throughout, and the narrative modulates effectively between technical description and emotional beats, though some filter phrases ("Elara frowned," "Elara smiled") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive touches like "stubbornness with a thesaurus" and selective perception under stress. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly the lisp-man's recognition of Lira and the buyer's taunting. Some filter verbs ("Lira froze," "She smiled") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments, and the buyer's voice description as "shattered glass" then "slicing the air" creates minor metaphor inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael's perceptual signature—tasting atmospheric changes—is distinctive and consistent throughout. The prose modulates from lyrical description to urgent physical reaction during the copper taste crisis. Lira's dialogue carries subtext about belonging to these mysterious places, though her voice could be more distinct. The narrative maintains POV discipline without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with evocative phrases like "auroral sorrow" and "prismatic crystals refracted the faint light." The grandmother's italicized dialogue carries authentic weight. However, some passages drift into overwrought territory ("the inescapable calling that had gnawed at him since childhood") and the narrative voice occasionally tells what could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent formality befitting a calligrapher—"gilded-leaf pen," "zinc-etched," "viscous lies." The keeper's synthesized voice and grief-lined face create effective contrast. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in places ("viscous," "balm") that occasionally distances from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting Elara's artistic sensibility. Phrases like "fingers deft as they adjusted the tension of each bronze curve" show character-specific noticing. The elevated diction occasionally strains ("harmonious bell tuner" feels redundant) but generally serves the contemplative tone. No dialogue appears, appropriately supporting the silence theme.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent android-consciousness with technical precision ("optics flickered," "circuits surged") while reaching for organic metaphors. The perceptual signature is distinct—an AI perceiving through technological frames. Some passages drift into elevated register ("harsh, inexorable drift") that slightly strains the established voice. Clean POV control throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with selective access to Clara's thoughts. Voice modulates appropriately between descriptive passages and dialogue. The perceptual signature (curator's eye for history in objects) is distinctive, though prose occasionally drifts toward generic literary description ("courtyard basked in dawn's glow").

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with lyrical touches ("as a spider spins its web—methodical, patient") and controlled psychic distance. The prose modulates effectively during the dance sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("liberating truth," "calm defiance") that slightly exceeds the established voice's natural range.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual details reflect Elias's focus ("shadows that seemed to pull at the edges of his mind"). However, the voice lacks distinction during emotional peaks—when memories flood him, the narration remains measured rather than reflecting his psychological state through syntax or rhythm changes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register with controlled rhythm and some distinctive phrases ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush"). The voice coheres around the summoner's perspective with appropriate lexicon. However, the reliance on abstract descriptors and elevated diction occasionally obscures immediacy, particularly in moments that should carry emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong narrative voice with distinctive diction ("dialects of stone and timber," "patience was the currency of their trade") that maintains consistency throughout. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly in the sugar-borrowing revelation that recontextualizes their relationship. The shift to embodied sensation when Elias speaks the building's language ("not from his throat, but from his bones") demonstrates excellent control of psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions ("petals as soft as mourning veils") and character-specific perception ("archived every failure... in the hollows of her ribs"). However, register occasionally drifts into overly elevated diction ("sibilant hiss," "wraithlike extension") that strains against accessibility. The POV remains stable, though some passages feel more like prose poetry than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("stalactites dripping like liquid time") and selective perception focused on tactile details of forgery. The prose modulates effectively between reflection and action, though occasional elevated diction ("calibrated treason," "mosaic of broken promises") slightly distances from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm - "where stone coils like a sleeping serpent." The "reed-blown melancholy" permeates diction choices. Minor convergence occurs in the hooded figure's speech which echoes Kael's register too closely, though the mystical context partially justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with phrases like "candle-lit shrine casting flickering shadows that danced like ghosts" establishing atmosphere. POV control remains stable in close third, with Kael's perceptual signature evident in how he reads emotional currents in dreams. Some sentences drift toward purple prose ("rustle of wind through frozen reeds"), and the three dream sequences lack sufficient rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong perceptual signature filters the world through Kael's philosophical lens—"the spaces between the fireflies' pulses, the quiet where the patterns hid." The prose rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to quickened discovery, maintaining consistent voice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close-third POV with appropriate narrative certainty. Voice modulates effectively from investigative precision to urgent realization. Some filter verb reliance ("Mara's breath fogged") and occasional register drift into academic tone ("trickle of stasis seeping"). Perceptual signature of pattern-recognition is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature - Kael notices through the lens of frequencies, patterns, and cosmic significance. Prose modulates effectively between technical precision and lyrical prophecy. Minor deduction for register drift into academic abstraction ("variant allegiance between factions or ideologies") that breaks the established mystical-technical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice shows lyrical ambition with phrases like "orchestra of ghosts" and maintains consistent register through most passages. Critical flaw: the parenthetical editorial comments "(Oops—too long. Let's trim.)" rupture POV and read as workshop scaffolding left in the text. The self-conscious poetry revision sequence undermines narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to an engineer-protagonist with controlled modulation during stress. Dialogue between Elias and ghost carries subtext about understanding versus conflict, though some phrases like "logically emotional" and "sonic absolution" feel artificially inserted rather than voice-organic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception focused on magnetic and lunar phenomena fitting Kael's role. Some repetitive phrasing ("softly purposeful" appears twice verbatim) and the elders' dialogue lacks distinction, but overall texture supports the meditative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: "Its brass frame was etched with symbols she'd traced to 19th-century abolitionists." Internal thought stays controlled through free indirect style. Cole's dialogue "Sentimental nonsense" and "Memory is a weapon" carries appropriate menace. Minor weakness: some filter phrases like "Mara knew better" and "she felt the weight" could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marcus's clerical voice comes through in measured observations and the fragment "By the way light breaks through storm clouds" that arrives unbidden. Mrs. Elms speaks with gentle authority befitting her role. Some filter verb accumulation ("he thought," "he knew") slightly dulls immediacy in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent inventive diction ("gears with feet," "unspool the future") and rhythm that accelerates during action. POV control holds steady with selective perception fitting Lira's obsessive focus. Dialogue serves character efficiently. Minor strain appears in explanatory passages ("She'd spent years studying the tip's grooves") that momentarily flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with tech-savvy diction appropriate to Lira's role. Phrases like "digital echoes" and "ghostly impressions in the system's memory" create a distinct texture. However, some register drift occurs ("oily with false sympathy" feels writerly rather than character-driven), and the dialogue lacks naturalistic subtext - both Hale and Elara speak in overly articulate exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature with Elara moving "as if she were a part of the landscape itself" and selective attention to the aurora's effects. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical description and tighter action during the mirror sequence. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strays from character voice ("manifestation of collective fear").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary distance with selective perception ("skeletal network of docks") that reflects Lila's detached state. The prose modulates effectively—tightening during the rescue, expanding in reflection. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("We all are"). Minor deduction for occasional overwriting ("mournful wail that seemed to emanate from the ice itself").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited through Elias with controlled psychic distance and clean prose mechanics. Dialogue differentiates the characters adequately—Elias speaks in measured philosophy while Lila responds in fragments—but both occasionally drift into overly articulate registers that don't reflect stress or emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains mystical consistency but relies heavily on abstract concepts ("whisperfield calm," "peripheral awareness") that distance rather than immerse. POV remains stable with Mara, but her perceptual signature lacks specificity—we get mystical terminology rather than how she uniquely experiences this world.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent perceptual signature through artistic observation ("arcs in their images...secrets waiting to be deciphered"). However, register occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("collective healing," "transmute pain"). No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains scholarly distance appropriate to Elias but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond academic observation. Repetitive sentence structures ("Elias began," "Elias placed," "He thought of") create monotony. Filter constructions like "he realized" and "he felt" distance us from immediate experience. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "fog clung...like a second skin" and selective attention to echoes over visual clarity. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent searching to peaceful acceptance. Some filter phrases ("he felt the familiar tug") and one instance of elevated diction ("monument to forgotten things") slightly above POV's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's scholarly perspective, with some effective perceptual signature ("hands steady as star charts"). However, purple prose intrusions ("luminous ache in his chest") and register drift into overly literary phrasing occasionally break character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("the sunrise flooding the radiant haven"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively in Elias's fragmented singing. Some register elevation ("alchemy of melody," "pulsing stillness") slightly mismatches the intimate hospice moment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains scholarly precision appropriate to Lirael's character, with selective perception focused on astronomical and runic details. Prose modulates effectively from patient observation to the energized discovery moment. Some filter phrases ("She felt it then") slightly dull immediacy at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's perceptual signature shows through her skeptical testing of thorns and analytical approach to the fountain. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Elias's "You still think you can outsmart the garden?" which wounds while revealing history. Some filter verbs ("Mara frowned," "she murmured") slightly dull immediacy during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with mystical register appropriate to the star watcher. Some elevated diction ("serpentine grotto," "zephyr bloom") fits the otherworldly setting. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads constellations others can't decipher. Minor template cadence in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent interiority with selective perception ("honeyed hush," "skeletal remains of servers"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext—"They're anchors...Without them, the place would float away." Minor deduction for occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she wondered") that slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains literary texture with phrases like "kelp in a storm" and "swirling hush," though occasionally drifts toward writerly self-consciousness ("unsettling clarity"). The guide-figure's dialogue lacks distinction from narration. Free indirect style works well in passages like "She'd come to collect the shapes of different hopes."

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains whimsical consistency with controlled vocabulary ("verdant arbor," "liquid gold," "forgotten tongues") that suits the fairy-tale register. However, POV modulation under pressure is minimal—Lira's perception doesn't narrow or fragment during the intense ritual. The talking animals' dialogue ("It worked," "Again tomorrow?") lacks distinctive voice or subtext, reading as functional rather than characterful.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with selective perception focused on tactile and visual details of the ritual. Strong moments like "frost-bitten lanterns" and "safekept starlight" create texture. Some filter phrases ("Elias believed," "he felt") occasionally dull immediacy without serving voice.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception matching Elias's peripheral focus—"he'd wondered if reason's cellar wasn't just another name for a grave." The prose modulates appropriately, though some passages drift toward explanatory register ("The timer had been designed to harmonize with these fluctuations") rather than staying in embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Kael's professional attention—"orient the lamp's flame just so," seeing the grotto as "a great beast." Voice modulates effectively from technical precision to emotional vulnerability at the mother's niche. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("Kael imagined") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in details like "threads that blurred the city's skyline into a watercolor haze." Some phrases drift toward writerly abstraction ("crystallized time," "harvest lessons") that feel imposed rather than character-authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent melancholic lyricism with selective perception focused on decay and fragments. Dialogue between Veyra and the ghost carries subtext about self-blame effectively ("You cling to fragments. The lagoon doesn't care"). Some phrases feel overwritten ("bruised violet," "electric gold") but the voice coheres around the POV's exhausted persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with purposeful diction like "functional creativity" and "redirected flows" that reflects Lila's engineering mindset. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—descriptions feel competent but generic rather than filtered through Lila's specific way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature: Lira notices through a clockmaker's precision ("excruciatingly gentle movements") and experiences the world in mechanical metaphors ("her heart that ticked in time"). The prose modulates effectively from technical precision to lyric expansion when the forecourt sings.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, and perceptual details like "eyes like drowned coins" show POV coloring. However, peak moments slip into elevated diction ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies") that feels writerly rather than character-driven, and the captain's warning dialogue lacks naturalistic subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's perceptual signature shows through selective attention to natural forms and patient observation ("infinitely patient hands," focus on patterns). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext, though the woman's speech occasionally drifts toward abstract pronouncement rather than naturalistic exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled psychic distance, and Elara's perceptual signature shows in her writer's attention to narrative and metaphor. The italicized passages effectively distinguish her written observations. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("lonesome splendor" appears three times), and some constructions feel artificially elevated beyond the POV's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent fairy-tale register with controlled diction ("bedraggled," "cacophony," "bioluminescent"). POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, some phrases feel overwrought ("frozen tear," "quaking reverie") and dialogue lacks naturalism—both characters speak in similar elevated registers despite different roles. The voice doesn't modulate sufficiently under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close-third POV with firefighter-specific perception ("gracefully alert," tactical assessment of the wing break). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, especially Mara's "What if she forgets me?"

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through paradoxical observations like "bruised sky" and "fractured starlight eyes."

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("The ancient greenhouse at dusk hummed with the quiet electricity"). The spectral voice distinction could be stronger. Marlow's poem demonstrates voice under pressure, and perceptual signature shows in how he notices craft details and textures.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct narrative voice with consistent POV and effective perceptual signature (Lirael notices mechanical details, iron veins, gear thirst). Some figurative language feels overwrought ("searing reverie that clouded her vision") and the phrase "the earth and sea fought a war only the pendulum could mediate" strains credibility within the established world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with phrases like "velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes." POV remains stable with Elara's perspective filtering all observations, though some passages drift toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds her gardener persona.

    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive diction ("Ignorance Cartographer," "predictive modeling") that reflects Lira's analytical mind. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, particularly the blacksmith's skepticism. The perceptual signature shows in how Lira sees patterns everywhere—stars as "celestial ledger," the spire as "giant clock." Minor register drift occurs when the narration explains concepts that Lira would take for granted.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("ember alcove where mist curled like smoke") and character-specific perception (musical transcription informing how she decodes lyrics).

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara's voice maintains consistency with her involuntary truthfulness coloring perception ("It tastes like regret"). The shift to public speaking mode feels earned given her character. Some register drift into explanatory mode during Voss's exposition weakens the middle section's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception—Lira notices "half an inch" leans and mismatched rhythms. Phrases like "While the streetlights daydreamed" show controlled lyricism. However, some passages drift into explanatory register ("Items that didn't belong, yet fit perfectly") that weakens immediacy, and filter constructions ("she thought," "she wondered") accumulate without adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    The telepathic communication method is distinctive and consistent ("flicker of warmth, tingle of curiosity"). Third-person limited POV maintains focus on Mara's experience. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("testament to nuance") that doesn't fully align with the underwater diving context and Mara's presumed voice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, mathematical precision ("counted each rise and fall as if the numbers might unlock something") that suits Kael's character. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, shifting from analytical to visceral ("slammed his fist into the stone"), though occasional abstractions like "infinite made of silence" slightly blur specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature with Lila's artistic lens filtering everything through color and texture. Voice maintains consistency through fatigue and revelation. Dialogue between Lila and Mr. Voss feels natural with appropriate subtext, though limited exchange prevents higher score.

    Voice maintains consistent cultural register with selective perception ("cultured museum guide" noting "moss-carved arches"). Dialogue stays minimal but effective ("Why's it green?" / "Teach us").

    Distinctive voice through phrases like "slow exhale of low tide" and "latent radiance" creates atmospheric texture. POV remains stable with Elias's technical perspective filtering perception ("reverse-engineered its mechanics," "feedback loop").

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara's voice maintains consistency with evocative descriptions filtered through her fractured perception ("eyes like fractured glass" echoed in how she sees). Vey's dialogue carries appropriate coldness and cryptic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature through sound-focused narration and musical metaphors ("cumulus scrolls...like sheet music").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains scholarly precision appropriate to a historian ("recapture," "recontextualize") with occasional elevation that fits discovery moments. Tomas's dialogue carries effective subtext about parallels and anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled diction ("stoically sensitive gaze," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") and consistent close-third POV.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, craft-focused perspective with distinct perceptual signature ("facets catching twilight like a thousand captured stars") and controlled modulation during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Distinct voice with strong rhythm control ("Elara laughed, a sound like shattered glass") and effective short declaratives under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira's voice maintains consistency through technical observations ("augmented reality overlays," "frequency spectrum") that fit her drone pilot expertise. The dialogue between Lira and pilgrim carries subtext about trust and shared purpose. The pilgrim's layered harmonics distinguish their speech, though their voice could be more individually textured beyond the mystical register.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's profession-filtered observations ("manufacturing false memories," reading carved histories). Prose modulates with discovery—short, sharp sentences during visions. Some filter-verb clustering ("He saw," "He knew," "He understood") dulls immediacy in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled imagery ("cartomancer's robes pooling like ink") and character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct voice with poetic compression ("ghostly resolve of centuries-old systems") and character-specific perception (Lira seeing stitching/fraying everywhere). The AI's "chorus of rustling static" adds texture. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("viscous shadows," "bioluminescent trees singing") slightly exceeds Lira's established lexicon, and occasional filter phrases ("she saw," "she had learned") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voices emerge in dialogue—Elyra's "diplomatic" precision versus Kael's more assertive declarations. The narrative maintains consistent close-third POV through Kael, with mechanical arm details providing perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong perceptual signature with Cedar's mismatched eyes and moth-wing coat creating distinct texture. The prose modulates effectively during the molting scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, somber rhythm suited to the subject. Dialogue is spare but potent, carrying significant subtext (“You occupy impossible spaces already”).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a narrative voice that is often lyrical and evocative.

    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, with a distinct narrative voice that is both lyrical and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice has moments of distinct texture. However, the dialogue feels stiff and primarily functional, serving as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than revealing character through subtext.

    The third-person limited POV is well-controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and filtering the fantastical events through Elara’s perceptions. The narrative voice is evocative and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, melancholic tone. The piece is weakened by a recurring use of abstract, almost academic phrasing to describe Lirael's process ("reactively visionary," "staggered intervals," "collisions of past and present"). This creates a narrative distance that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct narrative voice that successfully balances Elias's analytical and artistic sides.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, literary narrative voice that suits the calligrapher protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline until the final line, which is a jarring break into an impossible, omniscient perspective. This flaw severely damages an otherwise controlled and distinctive narrative voice. The prose has a lyrical texture, but some of the philosophical phrasing feels more authorial than character-driven, creating a slight distance. The final sentence represents a critical failure in POV integrity at the most important moment.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the story’s mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)

The narrative voice frequently slips from a plausibly animalistic perception into an elevated, lyrical register that feels external to the character ("riddle, etched into the grooves," "vibrations of words trapped in wax").

    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a narrative voice that is lyrical and well-matched to the mythic tone. The prose texture is distinct and engaging.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is the story's greatest strength, establishing a consistent, lyrical, and wholly unique perceptual signature rooted in the character's synesthesia. POV control is flawless, and the minimal dialogue is purposeful. Every description is filtered through Elias’s specific way of sensing the world, creating a memorable and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and effective, grounding the conceptual story in Elias's specific sensory experience. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, creating a lyrical and introspective voice appropriate for the story. Elara’s dialogue, while on-the-nose, is framed as "inevitably whimsical," which provides some internal justification. A minor weakness is the repetition of the authorial phrase "prismatic quiet," which feels slightly imposed on the character's perception at both the beginning and end.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Lila's focused, professional character.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Point of view is consistent and the prose maintains a controlled, literary voice.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the voice has a distinct, elevated, and lyrical quality appropriate for the cosmic scale. The prose effectively captures a sense of awe and temporal weight.

    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for a fable-like story. The use of a second POV is handled cleanly per Track C rules, with a clear break and no head-hopping.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Marcus's deliberate character. Dialogue is purposeful, though Mrs. Elms's speech leans more toward thematic exposition than naturalism.

    The voice is highly distinct, confident, and sustained, perfectly matching the character's blend of mechanical expertise and mystical obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)

    Perceptual signature dazzles: dawn "bled gold into the bruised sky" filters through Elara’s emotional lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, tense sentences during Thalos’ approach ("She froze"), flowing cadence in hum ("low and slow"). Thalos’ dialogue ("current, not a wave") distinct in lexicon yet consistent with his keeper role. Zero filter verbs; psychic distance stays anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("antennae like skeletal fingers," "tide dragging pebbles"), with rhythmic control tightening during construction ("soldered wires, air thick with burning insulation"); minor register drift in "patina bronze censer foot" momentarily disrupts voice authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV voice is distinct ("methodical grace," "lies curdled in air"), with stress-appropriate compression during the storm; Jorn’s fragmented dialogue ("They’re coming for me") reveals paranoia without over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature (“beard a nest of silver and seaweed”) filters details through Elias’s lens. Dialogue carries subtext (“You’re here for the memories”), with syntax tightening under stress (“Show me”) to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("brittle as dried leaves," "emerald shards") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in descent sequence flawless, with no head-hopping despite vision shift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight bled... pooling like liquid silver") but "lacy menace" violates queen’s plausible lexicon during high stress.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("logarithmic curl," "density of presence") modulates under pressure; Jorin's pragmatic dialogue contrasts Elara's poetic interiority. Rhythmic control in climax ("thousand crickets waking"). Minor register drift in "philosophy" mention.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines ("mossy marker," "snow crunched"); minor register drift in "primal place" disrupts voice consistency under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("phantom scent," gear rhythms) modulates perfectly from foggy opacity to clarity. Voice avoids POV leakage despite backstory. Minor register drift in "humanize the inanimate" prevents 9.0; otherwise exemplary rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "mist pooled like spilled milk" and "ink like liquid starlight" modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks with short sentences during crystallization ("The quill’s tip scraped the stone"), taught early and paid off in closure’s breath-holding moment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("dust smelled of regret") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "prismatic shards" during climax slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t fracture the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of aged paper," flickering candlelight) with rhythmic control in mural sequence. Minor register drift: "spiral arbitration" academic phrasing distances during high-pressure soul-confrontation. "Resounding hush" repetition borders on mannered but pays off in closure's hush-as-reminder.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("water so calm it mirrored the moon like a second sky") and rhythmic control shine, but "eminent peculiar" diction slightly clashes with Lorn’s blue-collar role. Compression in counting ritual is taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines: Kael notices "fractal patterns" and "energy patterns mirroring rhythms," with syntax tightening under stress ("He frowned. Afraid of what?"). Dialogue carries subtext (Lira’s "you’re late" implying history), and rhythmic control ("symphony of soft light") sustains voice without drift, though "conceptually" slightly strains specialist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: math metaphors ("ledger she couldn’t balance") persist under stress; rhythm accelerates at fork choice with clipped syntax. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during subway-car lurch.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature shines: "ring thrummed against his thumb" filters world through vibration. Rhythmic control under pressure ("humming under breath" to silt plunge) with zero head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: notices "prismatic shards that prickled skin" not just visual effects. Compression ("Three days prior...") anchors present guilt; Lira's dialogue carries subtext through implication ("Don't thank me. Thank the web").

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in harbor descriptions, but POV leaks during climax ("violin weeping and laughing" exceeds Kael’s observable reality). Stress-response syntax lacks degradation—tension flattened by lyrical uniformity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines in brushstroke analysis, but "volcanic tenderness" description slips into abstract label. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless during healing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV perceptual signature excels ("hum of flowers became a chorus"), but interiority over-articulates during crisis ("understood. The entanglement wasn’t a curse; it was a gift"). The second character’s dialogue lacks voice distinction, sounding thematic rather than character-particular ("To breathe life into a shared dream").

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted like ozone," map creases "sharp as knife cuts") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift with "geomagnetic storm" jarring for blue-collar POV.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice has distinct lyrical texture ("bruised sky like a bruise on glass"), but overwriting risks dilute immediacy—e.g., "serenity that wound through her like ivy" feels ornamental. Consistent POV filters details through Lira’s sensory focus, though stress compression undercuts peak-beat urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Clara’s magnetic sensitivity ("pieces rattling softly," "magnetic field tugged") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift in "humble rebellion" risks thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz veins singing," "lantern-moth hush") sustains rhythmic control under pressure; zero register drift despite lyrical density; patterned elision taught early pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fibers catching light like a whisper") shines, but filter verbs proliferate under pressure ("she realized," "she gasped"). In cave climax, abstraction ("texture raw and ancient") dilutes immediacy where tactile urgency should dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature shines: jeweler's precision ("meteorite iron," "fractal of stars") shapes noticing. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, fractured sentences during lantern lighting ("He worked through the night") contrast with flowing dawn prose. Zero POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("damp wood," "silver serpent" tape) and rhythmic control shine, but Elara’s lexicon drifts toward academic diction ("conceptual repricing") under pressure, muddying voice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes... atoms of nostalgia") and rhythmic control excel, but Lirael's dialogue "Corruption is just another pattern" drifts into academic register during confrontation, violating stress-appropriate diction for a historian avoiding "therapeutic self-awareness".

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp eyes tracing dusk’s approach") and rhythmic control under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally during shadow confrontation. Minor diction drift ("luminous with regret" slightly corporate for librarian POV).

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature (light/scale observations) and rhythmic control under pressure; syntax modulates from fragmented ("The workshop’s shimmering stillness seemed to hold its breath") to flowing at dawn, with zero POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines: Mara’s post-anesthesia hyperawareness filters details ("roots tapping Morse code," sand "vibrating in her teeth"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, fractured sentences during visions ("Mara gasped, the scar burning") contrast with flowing cadence in epiphany. Purposeful compression (condensed altar scene) teaches the pattern early, paying off in the resonant final image without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes like fractured galaxies") modulates rhythm under pressure, but spatial anchors evaporate during chamber dissolution. "Dust motes swirled" risks white-room syndrome amid intimate sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in Kael’s tactile noticing ("boots sinking," "hum in his bones"), and rhythmic control accelerates during the transformation beat; minor register drift occurs when "wave function" terminology briefly overrides character-bound lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "gears grew like leaves," copperwillows "trill like tuning forks" filter world through mechanic’s lens. Tension modulates syntax ("Elara closed her eyes, letting..."). Near-flaw: "prickling awareness" slightly over-explains sixth sense.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature (Lira’s "shoreline lullaby" voice vs. Jorin’s fidgeting) modulates well. However, verbatim repetition of "shoreline lullaby" phrase creates paraphrase loop, dulling rhythm under pressure and violating consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Veyra notices constellations as "frozen dance of fate," tomes as "whispering secrets." Rhythmic control under pressure—"steps echoing like a heartbeat"—avoids syntactic monotony. Purposeful compression (e.g., "eons deciphering") taught early pays off in climax velocity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s perceptual signature ("tapping a language only she understood") and rhythmic prose under pressure excel; slight register drift in "periodically eternal" momentarily distances voice during high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines: Lira filters sky as "bled from amber," notices grime on symbols. Voice modulates from lyrical ("silence clung like cobwebs") to staccato ("Now!") under pressure. Jax’s dialogue distinct in skepticism-turned-practicality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in plant telepathy ("melody of roots") and stress-tightened syntax ("Dig here. Before drones return"). Minor register drift with "implanted destiny" phrase, but justified as plant-whispered.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV perceptual signature shines in stress ("ears ringing, Elias’s blood on her dress" vs. calm "humming their song"). Rhythmic control during the flashback (short staccato phrases) modulates perfectly with pressure without head-hopping.

Psychic distance shifts intentionally when child speaks, preserving Lira's tactile focus.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ice crystals bloomed beneath her touch") persists under stress; minor register drift in "bravely conflicted" label slightly disrupts voice coherence during high-pressure awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers tracing rail spike") with rhythmic control, but "sorrow so profound it threatened to unravel composure" edges toward therapy-speak, narrowly missing 9+ threshold despite strong pressure modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature excels: "traced constellations etched into rosewood desk" filters astronomy through tactile heritage. Stress compression ("Her breath hitched. The nib trembled") avoids uniformity, though "proof by contradiction" slightly strains Clara’s plausible lexicon mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("walls hummed with forgotten frequencies," "flesh as canvas"), with rhythm accelerating during firmware entry; no head-hopping, and compression ("lab dissolved into static") is taught early and paid off in the digital labyrinth.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature thrives in artist-specific noticing ("cerulean blue," "galaxy’s arm"), but "emergent hush" diction slightly clashes with Mara's lexicon during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("stars burned like fractured glass") and rhythmic control under pressure, though "retrocognitively trapped" risks academic register drift in a high-stress beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: synesthesia filters all observation ("apples tasted of autumn twilight"). Rhythmic control peaks in echo-weaving ("dancer’s laugh... poet’s whisper... child’s giggle"). No head-hopping; voice modulates tension through sensory compression.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature shines in "sawdust carpet" and "moth-eaten maps" details; rhythmic control accelerates during echo's dissonant chorus. No head-hopping, though "librarian of half-remembered tales" momentarily drifts into authorial abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (spy noticing "silence between heartbeats") and rhythmic control under pressure excel, but "prudently daring" briefly drifts into academic diction, slightly disrupting voice coherence during high-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature shines: "fog rolled in like a second skin" filters through Thaddeus’s reflective lens. Minor register drift ("percolate through ambient awareness") slightly jars against otherwise consistent voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("mind like still water" filtering ash-taste, sun patterns) modulates rhythm under pressure; minor filter-verb stacks ("Mara realized," "Mara understood") dilute immediacy during the vision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature (tool notches as "tiny stars," salt/diesel smells) shines. But voice doesn't degrade under stress—Elias's poetic "luminous harbor" observations continue uninterrupted when emotionally vulnerable at Mara's door.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature shines in "pages fluttering like wings" and hum "coaxing shelves to sway"; syntax compresses under pressure ("She smiled, her reflection wavering but steady") without losing rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in technical details ("subsonic frequencies ripple through ionosphere"), though Professor Hale's "crossed himself" momentarily drifts from his established skepticism without character justification.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature excels: "breath came in shallow bursts," starlight "painting fractured blues" filters through Elias’s urgency. Rhythmic compression under stress ("He lunged forward") heightens pressure. Slight POV drift in "prudently adventurous" label mars otherwise controlled voice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Clara notices texture/shadow, not faces; Voss’s dialogue rasps with procedural weariness. Rhythmic control under pressure—e.g., "furrowed hush" lines—teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks as quarry details intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Clara’s map-librarian POV: charts are "margins," storms "cataloged," stanzas "unraveled." Rhythmic control peaks during roof scene—"sky turned sickly green, wind howled"—compressing diction under stress while maintaining voice coherence. No dialogue artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("wind curled around pine boughs") and rhythmic control shine, especially in high-pressure beats ("notes weaving like threads of light"). Marisol’s dialogue shift from "rusted hinges" to "polished stone" subtly charges her transformation without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "dusky harmony" and "polished calm" diction reflects Elias' controlled worldview. Rhythmic control excels during high-pressure beats (bill placements), though minor scaffolding appears in reflection blocks ("He remembered his father’s laugh"). No POV slippage; voice modulates effectively from observational to introspective without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: astronomy terms ("Whispering Veil," "variable stars") filter all descriptions. Rhythmic control peaks in the temple immersion ("I lost my child. I fear I'm unworthy. I miss the stars") where fragmented syntax embodies sensory overload.

No head-hopping; interiority modulates from methodical to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature shines: librarian notices "pale wintersun" light, not generic glow. Rhythm modulates perfectly—short sentences during transformation ("She plunged. For a moment, nothing.")—with zero head-hopping. Dialogue subtext ("Fear is a tide. It recedes.") reveals character. Slight deduction for "wintersun serenity" repeating motif without fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature distinct: "light that wasn’t light," "dripped like frozen tears" filters reality through inspector’s precision. Rhythm modulates under pressure—terse during climax ("During the heartbeat of a hesitation"), lyrical in closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally as confessions surge ("he wasn’t just an inspector; he was a conduit").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "green fingers" ivy and "sluggish" Thames—Mara's river chronicler lens filters all observation. Rhythm modulates perfectly from clinical ("daringly methodical") to raw ("creaking" accordion). No head-hopping; unreliability signaled through sensory precision.

Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from melancholic to resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "dripping rates" and "viaduct’s pulse" like a mage-scientist. Rhythm shifts under pressure (staccato "Drip. Drip. Drip." during climax), and Marla’s dialogue carries subtext ("less so") without voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("precisely humane," "broken teeth" for foundations) filters all detail through Mara’s warden lens. Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences when flashlight slices dark, lyrical flow in closure. No head-hopping; Elias’s daughter’s rasp voice contrasts Mara’s internal cadence perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature gleams in technical-poetic diction ("serenely electric static," "holographic map of infrastructure"). Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented syntax during console dismantling ("He slammed... dislodging... began dismantling") mirrors crisis without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "hollow echo," "static that formed constellations") reflects Kael’s profession and stress. Repetition of "resiliently positive" slightly flattens voice, but compression during climax ("lurch—not forward, but sideways") teaches and pays off its pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fever dream architect" noticing patterns) and rhythmic control shine under pressure; minor register drift with "rational enchantment" jargon at 80 words prevents 9.0.

    Distinct perceptual signature: Lumen’s telepathic "impressions" (tingle of curiosity) contrast Mara’s tactile urgency; rhythmic control intensifies during ampoule drinking without elision issues.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature strong ("tasted of ozone and regret"), but "balancedly daring" violates POV lexicon with academic drift; rhythmic control under pressure otherwise exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("orchids bloomed like defiant lips") and rhythmic control shine, though "methodically hopeful" borders on tell-y abstraction before cataloging action redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature in museum-guide precision ("moss-carved arches") and tactile baking details; tense shifts in "Lila’s mind raced" disrupt POV modesty but final loaf imagery recovers rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature sharp: "cogs shifted," "frayed at odd angle" reflects clockmaker's gaze. Rhythm accelerates during activation ("coil hummed... flared... erupted") then breathes at closure, avoiding uniform stress patterns under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes like fractured glass," condensation-slick mirrors) modulates rhythm under stress; no POV slippage, with syntax tightening during confrontation ("She scoffed. 'A lie? How?'").

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "clouds resembling crescendo" and "fractal rhythms"; rhythmic control peaks with "apples thudding to the deck in time," though minor psychic distance slip in "she’d found the mallet years ago."

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct cartographer perceptual signature ("traced grooves," "fracture widened") and stress-appropriate rhythm ("The shells did. They began to shift") falter slightly in "cold sweat broke out," a borderline cliché in peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines via surveyor's professional noticing ("fissure in the stone," "erosion"); voice modulates rhythm from reflective ("sunlight once danced") to tense ("Heart racing") without POV leakage, though "thoughts roared" borders cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines ("tranquilly perceptive gaze adjusted to gloom"), rhythm modulates under pressure. Minor register drift: "logical indexer" label slightly over-explained early versus later subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature distinct: "facets catching twilight like captured stars" mirrors her lens on grief. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences when shadow returns. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "polish until stone weeps."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: stress narrows focus to "ozone and ash," while lyrical fragments ("Perturbation. She knew that word") mirror her fractured psyche. Rhythmic control heightens pressure—short sentences for alarms, flowing cadence for transformation—without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Lira's augmented reality lens ("fractal patterns," "brilliant dimness") modulates under pressure. Pilgrim's harmonics-laced dialogue creates subtext, though "belonging is resonance" risks thematic echo if not for immediate narrative consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of salt and secrets") with rhythmic control; pressure modulates syntax (short phrases during visions); no head-hopping; "barnacles of conscience" exemplifies character-particular metaphor; tension in Lila’s withheld brother name carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Clara notices tactile details ("floral scrollwork worn smooth") under stress, with rhythmic compression ("Clara’s stomach tightened") during peak pressure. Dialogue carries subtext—Elias’s terse pragmatism contrasts Clara’s lyricism without convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature distinct: navigator’s eye notices "utility poles as land’s bones" and "sextant’s edge" voice. Rhythmic control under pressure—lyrical during reflection, sparse at climax ("She stood. She placed..."). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during lighthouse climb. Voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV voice is distinct ("guilt surfaced like ink in water") with pressure-appropriate compression, but J.T.'s "rustle of autumn leaves" voice lacks differentiation from Mara's internal rhythm, slightly diluting the Accumulative texture during pivotal dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Lira's beast-whisperer POV filters scents as "language older than speech," with stress compressing diction during transformation ("bones shifted, elongating"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via orchard's "silvered stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature is distinct ("air tasted of ozone," "robes pooling like ink"), with rhythm modulating under pressure—shorter phrases as the crack widens. Minor register drift in "willingly perplexed" slightly disrupts cartomancer voice during high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines in stress: Lira’s focus narrows to hush vibrations and bug light during confrontation. Voice modulates rhythm from lyrical (“stars burned low and slow”) to staccato (“She didn’t know what tomorrow would bring”) without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature (Kieran's angle-focused observations), but "burned like an ember" overwrites internal tension. Dialogue subtext ("Still at it, Sentinel?") elevates naturalism without voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "sand bleeding colors" and "star dust screamed"; rhythmic compression during vision-fracture ("The storm returned, a howling void") taught early and paid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in ash-filtered observations ("clouds roiled like liquid mercury") and rhythmic control via darkroom timer’s "click." Voice modulates from fragmented storm descriptions to steady verse-writing cadence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.6)
    Distinct perceptual signatures: Kael notices mechanical rhythms ("gears clicking"), Elyra tracks light patterns. Rhythmic control shifts from staccato fencing to lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via fragmented backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("flickering bulbs like desperate fireflies") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor filter-verb accumulation ("his mind wandered") in reflection beat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("compasses... fate’s way of laughing") and rhythmic control shine in "She played until her fingers ached, until the horizon outside finally invited night in with a sigh," compressing time while deepening emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("violets bled into golds," "scent of jasmine and iron") modulates under stress, though dream-sequence dialogue risks uniformity in the woman’s chorus-like voice during high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Yorick’s voice carries a distinct perceptual signature (“calloused thumb,” “rhythm of roots”) with rhythmic control (“slow as melting snow”). Lace metaphors modulate under pressure; no POV leakage despite dual characters. Dialogue indirection (“find the color of what my father never said”) carries subtext.
