    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision applied to natural observation. However, register drift occurs with phrases like "kindled humility" and "cathedral" that feel imposed rather than emerging from Elena's scientific mindset. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture or rhythm modulation under pressure—the prose remains evenly contemplative throughout without acceleration during the revelation. Phrases like "luminous glass artist" and "ethereal creations" feel like prompt-fulfillment rather than organic voice. No dialogue to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV but lacks distinctive voice - it reads as generic literary description. Repetitive phrasing plagues the text ("capsize survivor" appears 5 times, "tuning fork case" 6 times, "winterglass conservatory" 6 times). The narrative voice doesn't modulate with Elena's emotional state, remaining uniformly distant throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent melancholic beauty with phrases like "chased stillness that mimicked his own inner landscape." POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation in peak moments ("ethereal figures began to manifest") slightly exceeds Elias's established lexicon but doesn't break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Elias with controlled psychic distance. Voice carries quiet authority matching the "amplified quiet" tone, though prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("architects of their own future"). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot, particularly Mira's coded warning about checkpoints, though character voices could be more distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The mystical register suits Elara's spiritual seeking, with phrases like "pilgrim of sparks" and "keeper of light" creating consistent texture. Voice maintains appropriate distance for this reflective mode, though some passages drift toward abstract spirituality rather than grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization on Elara, with some effective perceptual shifts during temporal episodes ("viewing them like fading photographs"). However, register drift appears in peak moments ("hyperbolic geometry principles," "temporal landscape") that reads more like technical documentation than Elara's lived experience under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and clear focalization through Elara. Phrases like "staggering grace" create distinctive texture, and the prose modulates appropriately between action and reflection. Some formulaic constructions appear ("In the weeks that followed," "And in the fields where") but don't overwhelm the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains consistency with elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to the concept-driven narrative. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Kael's synesthesia could create more unique syntax or rhythm patterns. The prose remains in a literary register throughout without modulation for emotional intensity, missing opportunities to let stress affect the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages like "Time was accelerating, as it always did during these precious minutes." Dialogue feels natural and advances plot, though Lillian's internal voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("temporal light") that strains POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's theatrical narration ("Thus, inquiry finds its shelter!") creates a distinct if overwrought voice, but the repetitive structure—"Elias [verb]" opening most paragraphs—creates monotonous cadence. The contemplative register matches his character, yet lacks the syntactic variety and compression that would elevate dramatic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains Maya's perspective consistently with appropriate psychic distance for her emotional state. Phrases like "heart-pounding fear" and "trembling certainty" align with character stress. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal patterns," "unstoppable power of absolute truth") that doesn't fully match a panicked stunt double's immediate thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains mystical register appropriately through "pebble-shore oracle" and "ambered hush," with syntax that mirrors the marbled quality of alternating sound and silence. Dialogue remains minimal and weighted ("Each silence speaks"). However, occasional register drift into abstract philosophizing ("architecture of darkness rather than light") weakens immediacy during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    The robotic POV maintains consistency with selective perception appropriate to a sentient janitor. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("reverent atmosphere," "primordial") that strains against the established voice. The Chinese character "某种" appears unexplained, creating unnecessary opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture or perceptual signature. Elara observes but her way of noticing doesn't reveal character—descriptions like "gleaming under the moonlight" could belong to any narrator. The voice doesn't modulate with discovery or decision; emotional peaks read the same as quieter moments.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains consistency with appropriate diction for a philosophical gardener, and the free indirect style works. Perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices botanical details and interprets garden responses. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("singular artistic stance") that doesn't fully match the established voice, and some passages read as authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains scientific precision with phrases like "obliging soul" and "mechanically warm" creating mild distinctiveness, though register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("temporal interfaces otherwise invisible"). POV remains stable in third-limited, and technical vocabulary fits the xenobiologist context. However, perceptual signature lacks the selective bias that would make Aris's scientific mind truly distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with appropriate distance for Elias's perspective. Some diction elevates beyond necessity ("capricious nature," "liminal threshold") without clear voice motivation. The perceptual signature shows a musician's attention to sound and silence, though syntactic variety could better support emotional modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency through academic precision mixed with fevered intensity ("metaphysicist and fault-tolerant oracle"). The perceptual signature shows in selective details like the botanical illustration's importance, though some passages drift into overwrought territory ("celestial tears shed for truths too heavy to voice aloud").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with explorer-appropriate diction and controlled psychic distance. However, register drifts into academic abstraction during peak moments ("drowsy alertness that had been creeping over him") and the dialogue from the radio lacks naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct narrative texture with phrases like "drift of untold seasons" and "fractured sunlight" creating a timeless, contemplative register. Some elevated diction ("impermeable silence," "entropy's inevitable advance") occasionally strains against immediacy but serves the chronicle-keeper's detached perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV through Maya with appropriate psychic distance. Some passages drift into elevated register ("aromatic sentinels," "suspended moment") that doesn't fully match the character's mellow therapist persona. Dialogue is minimal but functional, though Lila's first words feel slightly precocious for a traumatized ten-year-old.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical phrases like "bronze quiet" creating texture, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic reverence. Repetitive sentence structures ("The historian's motivation..." "The odd historian's sensitively perceptive...") create monotony. No dialogue to evaluate, and the POV remains stable but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited voice maintains consistency and creates a contemplative tone appropriate to the character. Diction suits the philosophical writer ("transpose life into a new key," "cosmic current"). However, the prose lacks rhythmic variation—most sentences follow similar compound structures, creating monotony. No dialogue appears to test character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent omniscient distance with occasional effective moments like "muffled clarity." However, prose tends toward abstract theological register ("sonic architecture," "dimensional anchor") that distances reader from visceral experience. Dialogue (the incantations and entity's response) serves its purpose but lacks distinctive character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the protagonist's artistic sensibility, with phrases like "chronologically homesick" and "upturned hush" creating distinctive texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract territory ("vibrations building within and around him") without sufficient grounding in physical sensation, and lacks the perceptual signature that would make this specific writer's consciousness unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.7)
    The POV maintains consistency and the narrative voice suits the speculative premise. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices things generically ("intricate patterns," "bruised purple sky") without character-specific selection. The register occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("According to the inscriptions") that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct texture or perceptual signature specific to Eleanor's deafness. Phrases like "filament of hush" and "mirrored hush" feel artificially literary rather than emerging from Eleanor's consciousness. The prose doesn't embody how a deaf person might perceive and process the world differently.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some effective perceptual detail ("meticulous storm recorder," "silver feathers"), but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntax. Multiple instances of telling rather than showing ("credibly curious," "layered tranquility") and repetitive phrasing weaken voice specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent melancholic register appropriate to the grieving POV, with some lovely rhythmic moments ("echoes in aroma"). However, voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("sorrow-filled eyes," "molecular structure"), and some passages read more like creative writing exercise than authentic interiority. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "ethically playful smile" and "passionate subtlety," but relies heavily on filter constructions ("seemed to," "felt," "realized"). The perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—any contemplative character could notice these same details.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong—Kael's acoustic sensitivity colors descriptions ("detecting vibrations others could never hear"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tapestry of sound," "seeds of a new beginning") that doesn't fully match the character's grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited perspective with controlled psychic distance and professional register appropriate to Elias's character. However, the voice lacks distinctive texture—sentences follow similar patterns ("Elias picked up," "Elias moved closer," "Elias reflected") creating monotony. No dialogue appears to test voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("unparalleled ability to navigate," "familiar stirring"). Voice modulates appropriately between business precision and emotional recognition. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext, particularly Eleanor's understated responses revealing professional isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with phrases like "shaped whispers from marsh-reeds" and "rootless yearning," though occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("boldly sympathetic regard") that feels forced. The Chinese character intrusion "沟通推进" breaks immersion completely and suggests editing oversight.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with an illustrator's observational precision ("meticulous drawings," "crystalline patterns"). Some effective modulation during stress moments. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic fantasy register ("ethereal light," "suppressed sound") rather than maintaining the naturalist's specific perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with selective perception focused on magical elements and emotional undertones. Prose rhythm varies appropriately, though some passages drift into elevated register ("ambiguous loss," "mathematics of emotion") that feels slightly removed from embodied experience during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent close third POV with selective perception reflecting the protagonist's archival expertise and spatial knowledge. Strong perceptual signature in how they navigate by touch and memory. However, some register drift into elevated diction ("sapphire hush," "kindly methodical grace") that doesn't match the character's practical mindset during physical navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("Tilia species," "genetic anomaly") appropriately softening as Elara transforms. However, some passages slip into telling mode ("Her reluctant metamorphosis was complete") and the dialogue feels slightly stilted.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with effective free indirect style showing Lena's artistic perspective: "restless oceans and fragmented memories." Her "wryly earnest" quality comes through in dialogue and perception. However, voice occasionally drifts toward explanatory register ("The brooch felt like a piece of unearthed convergence"), and the old woman's dialogue lacks distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistency with Elara's perceptual signature focused on patterns and possibilities. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("nascent," "manifest") that feels authorial rather than character-driven. Some phrases like "shadows began to inhabit the very air" and "bright darkness made manifest" border on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct texture—Elina's perceptual signature doesn't emerge beyond her visions. Prose tends toward the abstract ("navigated absences," "systematic removal") rather than embodied perception. No dialogue appears to test character voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains Ethan's analytical perspective consistently, with phrases like "geometric symphonies" and "analytically artistic mind" establishing his distinct perceptual signature. The prose modulates effectively from precise observation to wonder as he enters the vault. Some repetitive constructions ("trembling certainty" appears twice) and occasional filter-heavy passages slightly diminish immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically rather than through the specific lens of a skeptical astronomer's granddaughter. Voice doesn't modulate with emotional intensity; the same measured tone persists whether describing routine transcription or transformative visions.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.6)
    The omniscient narration maintains consistent distance and formal register appropriate to the immortal protagonist, with phrases like "taffy in his immortal mind" showing occasional distinctiveness. However, the voice lacks a unique perceptual signature—descriptions could belong to any educated narrator rather than specifically to someone who has lived millennia. No dialogue appears to test character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate formality for Maya's profession and background. POV control is clean throughout, though the narrative occasionally drifts toward explanatory modes ("Maya had always found comfort...") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains an appropriately contemplative register with phrases like "incandescent restraint" and "temporal texture." POV remains stable in close third. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("reverently handled," "sacred duty") that feels slightly performative rather than emerging from Elias's specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistency with poetic compression and controlled diction, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond philosophical abstraction. Sentences like "I exist within the towering labyrinth" establish atmospheric tone but the narrator's specific way of noticing remains generic. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision appropriate to Evelyn's profession, modulating effectively during discovery moments ("miniature galaxies in the abandoned darkness"). POV control is clean with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature shows through her scientific framing. Some phrases feel overwrought ("whisper of closing pages") but overall the prose texture supports character and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture beyond competent description. Maya's perceptual signature as someone who "recognizes patterns others missed" drives plot but doesn't inflect the prose rhythm or diction. The single line of dialogue feels natural but appears too briefly to establish subtext or character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV focused on Elena, with some evocative descriptions like "swirling dance of light below." However, the narrative voice lacks distinctive character—phrases like "purposefully curious by nature" and "dawnlit melancholy" feel writerly rather than emerging from Elena's specific perception. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Elias's non-visual senses and technical expertise. The prose effectively modulates between technical precision and emotional resonance. Minor deductions for occasional elevated diction ("ethereal silence," "vulnerable nerves") that slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains dry precision befitting an atlas editor, with controlled diction like "practiced precision" and "methodical grace" that modulates into wonder without losing character consistency. POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature shown through Elmsley's attention to patterns and measurements. Dialogue is minimal but the "Rivers don't begin with springs...They begin with intention" line strains credibility as spoken utterance to an uncomprehending listener.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature focused on resonance and vibration. Voice modulates effectively between technical precision ("jagged scar in the town's harmonic foundation") and lyrical observation ("dusk bled into the wild hush"). Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("star-choked sky") slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency through scientific observation filtered through Elena's archaeological expertise. Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to hieroglyphs and temple architecture. Some register drift into elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "agonizing slowness") that doesn't fully match the established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.6)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with its repetitive, meditative rhythm appropriate to the accumulative structure. However, perceptual signature remains generic—the narrator could be anyone reflecting on inherited guilt. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lattice from confessional," "copperlight repose") without clear POV justification.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent omniscient distance with lyrical texture ("ashen-veil ghost bride drifted between rows of impossible fruits"). Voice modulates effectively between ethereal present-scene description and grounded backstory. However, several instances of template cadence appear ("She had rushed...Thomas survived...As he lay dying") and the narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness—the prose could describe any mystical transformation. Elara's POV filters little through specific perception, and the narrative distance remains uniformly distant without modulation during supposed peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("grotesque yet beautiful dance") reflecting Kaelen's archaeological reverence. Elena's brief dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext. However, some passages drift toward elevated diction ("grotesque yet beautiful dance that defied conventional burial practices") that doesn't fully match a returnee's immediate perception, and filter phrases like "he felt" appear without strong voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to Elara's role as a linguistic artist. Perceptual signature shows in how she reads the arcade's light and interprets chalk patterns. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract register ("hyper-connected yet emotionally distant future") that distances us from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with distinctive perceptual signature—Elara notices cosmic patterns others miss while performing studied obtuseness. Dialogue effectively carries subtext ("that dim-witted needle-woman") with natural indirection. The prose modulates between lyrical observation and practical action, though some phrases like "whispered secrets of the universe" lean toward the generic-mystical.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, filtering perception through Elara's mystical sensibility ("cryptic medium"). Some passages drift into elevated register ("fierce and tender," "harmonies speaking of unsent letters") that occasionally feels writerly rather than character-driven. The prose modulates appropriately during emotional peaks, though relies on some filter constructions ("she knew," "she understood") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with literary register and controlled rhythm, though repetitive phrasing ("shrewdly innocent" twice, "unknot" four times) creates template cadence. POV remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Kaelen's translator background doesn't sufficiently color his specific way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with specific perceptual details like "stones whispered secrets only she could hear." Dialogue feels natural in the few instances it appears ("We remember how to celebrate"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pensive mirth lifting her spirits") that doesn't fully align with Amelia's artist perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical-restoration voice with some effective sensory fusion ("acoustic patterns touching her skin like gentle rain"). However, register drift appears in abstract passages ("layers of understanding nested within her consciousness like Russian dolls") that clash with the tactile restoration work. The POV remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the art-sound connection.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with academic-tinged prose appropriate to the scholar protagonist, though diction occasionally drifts into overly formal register ("converging chaos of their methods"). POV remains stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond botanical awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyric voice maintains consistent poetic register with controlled rhythm ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy"), though no dialogue tests character distinction. POV distance remains stable in omniscient retrospective, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—the poet observes but rarely through character-particular bias or selective attention.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Eleth's role as caretaker of delicate, ethereal objects, with selective perception focused on preservation details and fragility. Phrases like "whisper-like disturbance" and "cloud-mist below continued its endless dance" create a distinct texture. Some filter verbs ("Eleth moved," "Eleth smiled") slightly dull immediacy in places where more direct narration would strengthen the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elena notices what any scholar might notice. Prose relies on abstract descriptors and therapy-speak ("cautious exuberance," "carefully reckless") rather than character-specific observation. No dialogue appears to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains consistency with engineering-minded observations ("molecular composition," "strategic channels") fitting Elara's profession. Some phrases feel overwrought ("dormant volcano's ancient heartbeat," "mystical embrace") creating register drift. The POV stays stable, though the prose occasionally reaches for elevated diction that doesn't match the character's practical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with poetic diction ("traces of her past...like discarded feathers") that suits the reflective tone. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads patterns others wouldn't see. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("extraterrestrial mysteries") beyond what stress would naturally produce, and some filter constructions ("she felt," "seemed to") dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "featherly determination" and "fractured hush," creating a dreamlike register appropriate to the reality-shifted setting. The father's brief dialogue carries authentic emotional weight, though some passages drift toward elevated abstraction ("liminal spaces her father had always been drawn to").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical-scientific register appropriate for a landscape astrologer, with phrases like "shadowseam wonder" creating distinct texture. However, abstract emotional declarations ("overwhelming connection," "profound simplicity") replace embodied perception during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct personality beyond gentle philosophical musing. Repetitive sentence structures ("The recollectionist..." begins too many paragraphs) create monotony. The narrative distance remains too uniform, never modulating to reflect emotional intensity or discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and Leo's analytical perspective colors observations like "calculating patterns in the chaos." However, the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("This was his method") and the woman's brief dialogue lacks distinctiveness beyond functional politeness.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register but lacks distinct character voice - Lira's interiority could belong to any mystical protagonist. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("obsidian grace," "cosmic truth," "profound vision") without grounding in specific perception. No dialogue to test naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with contemplative rhythm and elevated diction appropriate to Mara's reflective nature. However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature—the observations could belong to any thoughtful protagonist. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("shadows pooled," "stars wheeled slowly"). Prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity. Some filter verb usage ("he remembered," "he realized") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond generic poetic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains mystical distance appropriate to the material, with selective perception focused on magical elements. Some passages drift into elevated register ("grace that came from centuries of practice") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered, and dialogue is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elian notices things generically ("worn leather shoes," "weathered stone") without character-specific selection. No dialogue appears despite the negotiation frame, missing opportunities for subtext and character distinction. The narrative distance remains uniformly distant, observing Elian from outside rather than inhabiting their specific consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Silas reads the landscape through "cracks in dried riverbeds" and notices "sacred geometry only he could decipher." Voice modulates appropriately from corporate calculation to whispered ritual words. However, some register drift occurs with phrases like "manufactured drought had been a calculated business decision" that feel more like authorial summary than Silas's natural thought pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the mystical subject matter, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("liberation of consciousness itself"). The POV remains stable in close third. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's specific way of noticing doesn't distinguish her from a generic mystical protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and philosophical tone appropriate to Elias's character, with some effective rhythm in performance sequences. However, prose tends toward abstract declarations ("uncommonly serene," "meteor hush") rather than concrete perception. The lack of dialogue removes opportunities for subtext and voice distinction that would typically elevate this category.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in passages like "transiently rooted in the treetops that defied gravity." Some moments edge toward purple prose ("divine chorus," "cosmic forces") but generally the diction serves the elegiac mood. The perceptual signature focuses on patterns and interruptions fitting the character.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register appropriate to the sacred setting. "Snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" create distinctive texture. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("ethereal blues and greens") that slightly exceeds Elara's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a dreamlike, philosophical register appropriate to Elara's condition, with controlled rhythm during the ritual sequence. Some passages drift into elevated diction ("ethereal grit settling into her bones") that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent scholarly precision with mystical undertones ("dusky harmony in his soul"). Perceptual signature shows through Anu's astronomer's eye noting patterns and calculations. No dialogue appears, avoiding potential pitfalls. Minor register drift occurs with "dato felt like cooled honey" introducing an unexplained term.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable in third-limited focused on Marcus, with consistent psychic distance. However, dialogue lacks naturalism - both characters speak in elevated metaphorical registers ("shifting grace as reality transforms") that don't differentiate their voices or reflect stress.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains consistent register with controlled, craft-focused diction appropriate to the mirror maker's expertise, and rhythm effectively slows during the transformation sequence. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous butterfly of starlight and mathematics") that feels more authorial than character-driven, and lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond professional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices through a mender's lens ("bent nails, cracked porcelain, rope fragments, all waiting for new purpose"). The prose modulates effectively between action and reflection, though occasional filter phrases ("she knew the bridge was working") slightly distance the reader. No dialogue appears, avoiding potential voice convergence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent philosophical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Repetitive constructions ("Elias" starts numerous sentences) and filter-heavy narration ("he realized," "he felt," "he knew") distance us from immediate experience. The voice doesn't modulate with emotional intensity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision befitting an "arcane linguist" - "calculating pathways," "lexicons," "mercurial library spaces." The guardians' voice as "pages turning in a vast space" distinctively captures their nature. However, dialogue lacks subtext; characters state intentions directly ("Your terms no longer serve our mutual purpose") without indirection or goal-pursuit through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "memories alter within its rusty hull, shifting like the mist outside." Some passages drift into elevated register ("blissfully aberrant," "unkindled solace") that occasionally strain against the intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close third POV with Eleanor's archival mindset coloring perception - she "traces," "documents," and approaches with "methodical" precision. The prose maintains academic register appropriate to her profession. Minor weakness: her internal voice doesn't modulate enough under the pressure of extraordinary discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate fantasy register, though lacks distinctive texture. POV control is stable but the perceptual signature remains generic—the mapkeeper notices what any keeper would notice without character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the lone custodian. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara experiences time backward and forward simultaneously. Some phrases feel overwrought ("thistle-blown hope") and the prose occasionally drifts toward purple without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elthion's archival perspective, with phrases like "memories dripping like rain" and "deepening hush" creating atmospheric texture. The POV remains stable throughout, though the narrative voice occasionally explains rather than embodies ("His method was precise").

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with distinctive touches like "walking chant" and "ambient awareness" that feel character-specific. The prose modulates effectively from meditative opening to focused concentration during the performance. Perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices pattern breaks and filters the world through his craft expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited but suffers from filter-verb stacks ("Maya realized," "she understood," "Maya felt") that dull immediacy. Repetitive constructions like "Maya's [noun]" and "The jade cicada" create template cadence. No dialogue appears despite the framing "difficult conversation," missing opportunity for subtext and character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("intangibly tangible," "stretching contracted feeling") and exposition rather than embodied perception. Multiple filter constructions ("she felt," "she knew") distance us from immediate experience, particularly during what should be the story's most visceral moments of ascent and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with selective perception focused on light, sound, and passenger micro-reactions. Some syntactic repetition ("Elias believed," "Elias smiled," "Elias watched") creates mild template cadence that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent fantasy-adventure register with controlled vocabulary ("chronometer," "fractured light"). POV remains stable in third-limited without head-hopping. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything with equal clarity regardless of stress. The voice modulates minimally between exploration and discovery moments, missing opportunities for rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical, contemplative tone appropriate to the shadow keeper's nature. Perceptual signature evident in focus on shadows, ash, and threshold imagery. Some register elevation ("liminal space where shadows gained substance") fits the mythic tone but occasionally distances.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with appropriate psychic distance for Maya's journey, and specialized vocabulary around the farm and quantum concepts fits the POV. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register during emotional peaks ("shadowseam wonder," "quantum redemption") that feels imposed rather than character-driven. The glitchy text messages provide textural variety but their typography feels gimmicky rather than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.3)
    The formal, contemplative voice suits the protagonist's scholarly approach and maintains consistency. However, the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature - descriptions feel writerly rather than filtered through this specific character's expertise or emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated fantasy register appropriate to the mystical subject matter, using controlled syntax like "patterns of movement that could transcend the ordinary realm" to establish atmosphere. POV remains stable in third-person limited, filtering all perception through Galen's experience. However, occasional register drift into abstract declaration ("factually mystical nature of his experience contradicted everything") pulls away from embodied perception, and some phrases feel template-derived rather than voice-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    Eleanor's archival voice comes through in her methodical observations and dust pattern analysis. The prose modulates between clinical observation and emotional recognition. However, Benjamin's dialogue lacks distinction, and the narrative occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured souls," "invisible threads of compassion") that doesn't match Eleanor's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, filtering perception through Mara's rebel perspective ("carefully resourceful rebel few noticed"). Dialogue between Mara and the informant, then with Theodor, carries appropriate urgency and subtext. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into explanatory register ("Officially, these had been flooded; in truth...") that breaks from Mara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with atmospheric descriptions and musical metaphors, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Ethan could be any competent musician rather than this specific fog saxophonist. Repetitive phrase structures ("As dewdrops formed," "Ethan recalled," "Ethan knew") create mechanical cadence without purposeful rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic register with controlled diction ("chlorophyll and pollen," "sacred sliver"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices seed varieties and arbor responses. However, several passages drift into elevated abstraction ("the hush where past meets prophecy") without grounding in her specific consciousness, and repetitive constructions ("always emerges transformed always") create awkward echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance. Some formulaic constructions ("For years, he had..." "One afternoon...") and filter verb clusters ("Elias noticed," "he realized"). The POV maintains coherence but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the clock-maker's attention to rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate diction for a mystical alchemist ("factually mystical," "crucibles and molds"). Some effective rhythm variation. However, occasional register drift into overly philosophical territory ("the very foundations of being") and limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with soul-collector lexicon ("spectral whispers," "luminous ache"). Dialogue feels natural, especially Thomas's childlike "I'm afraid I'll forget how to laugh." However, Elias's interiority tends toward abstract telling ("beautiful suffering between worlds") rather than embodied perception during pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV maintains consistency through Kai's trauma-filtered perception, with proprioceptive awareness creating distinctive sensory signature. However, register drifts into clinical abstraction ("systematic deconstruction of his humanity," "proprioceptively enhanced senses mapping") that clashes with embodied trauma state. Voice loses specificity in philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains a dreamy, lyrical consistency appropriate to the premise, with controlled use of repetition ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition"). However, the POV lacks distinct perceptual signature—the narrator notices everything with equal, abstract poetry rather than selective, character-specific attention.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice maintains consistent technical precision filtered through Marcus's professional perspective ("practiced caution," "structural anomalies," "resonant energy"). The perceptual signature is distinct—he notices "minute vibrations," "dust accumulation patterns," and "vertical spaces" others miss. Some passages drift toward explanatory ("Marcus had pieced together these stories over months") but the overall texture remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical diction appropriate to the fantastical setting. POV remains stable in third-limited, though perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—Eldon notices what any archivist might notice. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "ornate labyrinth" and "burnished sorrow," matching Elias's poetic inclination. Perceptual signature shows in how he sees the shard "not as mere archaeological evidence but as a vessel of stories." Some register drift occurs with academic phrasing like "archaeological dispute" and "poetic interpretation" that occasionally distances from scene immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with musical metaphors ("fingers that danced," "symphony of echoes") that suit the repairman protagonist. The prose has distinct texture with controlled rhythm, particularly in describing Elias's work. Some phrases like "covenant of rust" and "tinkersong wonder" feel artificially elevated for the POV but don't significantly harm coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "sensibly eccentric" and "resonant hush" creating distinct texture. The mystical register suits the material, though some moments ("something ancient stirred within her") rely on familiar spiritual language rather than fresh perception.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistency but lacks distinctive voice - Elena's perceptions could belong to any contemplative artist. Repetitive phrasing appears throughout ("spirited driftwood sculptor" three times, "timewoven alliances" five times). The narrative voice doesn't modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with artistic perception ("scattered embers," "umbral tenderness") and modulates appropriately between description and discovery. Some elevated diction ("celestial light," "profound as the first snowfall") occasionally drifts from Elara's established register, but perceptual signature remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrases ("chromatic memories," "resurrected heart"). However, register drift into academic abstraction ("civil rights history had always been her professional domain") clashes with the mystical elements, and several passages read as authorial thesis rather than Ellara's authentic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elior's thoughts, though the voice lacks distinctive texture - phrases like "deeper mysteries" and "dormant potential" feel generic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to Elias's scholarly perspective, with selective perception focused on textures and historical weight. The prose modulates effectively during the prophecy sequence. However, some passages drift into overly explanatory register ("His motivation had shifted over the years") that tells rather than embodies the change.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception filtered through Anya's expertise. The "furious tranquility" and "wild serenity" paradoxes work linguistically.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "practiced hands and unwavering focus" that suit the patient observer.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.3)
    The cosmic register maintains consistency but lacks distinct personality—Elion's voice could belong to any spiritual seeker. Prose relies on abstract descriptors ("ethereal痕迹," "flourishing stillness") without the perceptual signature that would make his consciousness specific.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("moonlight spilled across the scorched wasteland") and controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery moments. The perceptual signature of noticing spirit behaviors and glass imagery shows character-specific observation. Clean free indirect style maintains consistent psychic distance. However, some register elevation ("mute eloquence," "tangible manifestation") occasionally drifts from the established voice, and dialogue absence means no test of voice distinction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically rather than through a specific borrowed-time timekeeper's lens. Prose tends toward elevated register ("temporal resonance," "fractured chronology") without grounding in character-specific idiom. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the poet-protagonist, with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic poeticism. No dialogue appears to test naturalism, and the narrative distance remains uniformly contemplative without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled distance and some lovely perceptual signatures ("fingers tracing patterns in the air as he slept"). Prose rhythm generally supports the meditative pace. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite fit ("dormant bridges between human consciousness"), some filter verb reliance, and missed opportunities for more distinctive voice texture during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains consistency and attempts elevated register appropriate to the protagonist, though it tends toward purple prose ("celestial confetti," "whispered invitations from his own future"). No dialogue weakens dramatic immediacy. The POV remains stable but lacks the distinct perceptual signature that would make Elian's scientific skepticism shape how he notices and processes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, folkloric diction ("gloom-hill coachman," "fragile embrace") that suits the parable-like tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, and interiority often tells emotional states rather than embodying them through the coachman's specific way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third-person with appropriate lexicon ("arkadaş" suggesting cultural specificity). The perceptual signature of color detection and scent-memory suits the bloodhound character. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("wild hush," "tinted revelations") creates mild inconsistency with Silas's pragmatic voice. Clean POV maintenance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains basic consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically ("dim light," "vast emptiness") without character-specific selection. Prose alternates between overwrought metaphor ("cartographer of hope," "sacred duty") and repetitive phrasing about isolation and purpose. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The narrative voice reads as literary template rather than emerging from Elara's particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV focused on Kael, with phrases like "cautious abandon" and "sacredly playful" creating distinct texture. However, dialogue between Kael and his master lacks naturalistic rhythm and subtext, reading more like exposition delivery than genuine conversation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm in phrases like "fragmented murmurs" and "luminous absence," though occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction. The perceptual signature shows Elara reading movement as language and absence as presence. The Chinese text intrusion breaks voice consistency at the critical ending moment, and some passages lean heavily on abstract conceptual language rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic-literary register appropriate to the seer protagonist, with phrases like "mercury-glass seer" and "labyrinthine corridors" establishing tone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistency with elevated literary register appropriate to the premise. However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature - the tutor's chess-master perspective doesn't meaningfully filter what he notices. Phrases like "fierce repose" and "productive fidgeting" feel forced rather than organic to the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, poetic register appropriate to Elara's artist identity. Perceptual signature shows in how she sees the spire as "art daring convention to a duel."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "liminal space" and "beautiful isolation" that suit an alchemist's perspective. The controlled, contemplative rhythm matches Marcel's methodical nature, though occasional overwriting ("roiling acid sea," "iridescent sparks") slightly dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting an aging painter (attention to light, color, detail). Some passages achieve distinct texture ("porcelain impossibility"), but others fall into generic literary description.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, and some phrases like "cobalt lighthouse stood strong" and "screaming tenderness" show voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on navigation tools and signals. Phrases like "raw solace" and "geography of loss" create distinct texture. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("testament to this journey") that doesn't fully align with the practical navigator's perspective. Dialogue remains minimal but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on methodical details and physical sensations.

No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the isolation theme but limits voice distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's perceptual signature shows in his meticulous observations and brass spectacles adjustments, with the prose rhythm slowing during memory sequences to mirror his processing. The narrative distance remains stable in close third.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. Phrases like "parchment ghosts" and "measuring coastlines...never his own" show distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV remains stable and the voice has moments of distinction ("gilded cage of royalty"). However, phrases like "weary determination" and "ancient knowing" rely on telling rather than embodied perception, and the narrative distance feels inconsistent during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's perceptual signature—seeing "stories and emotions made solid and warm" in photons—distinguishes the narrative voice effectively. The prose modulates between technical precision ("geothermal activity," "photons and thermodynamics") and lyrical observation. However, some passages drift into elevated register that strains against the established voice ("the profound density of presence"), and dialogue is minimal, limiting character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled rhythm that modulates during the vision sequence ("boundaries blurring until cabin walls became transparent"). The perceptual signature—how Elias experiences time as "slippery, disjointed"—is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third-person with character-specific perception ("miniature dragons," "living creature emerging from myth"). Some filter verb accumulation ("she felt," "she watched") and occasional register elevation ("meticulously trimmed tip") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative descriptions and Eloise's distinctive metaphorical thinking ("paper coffins," "startled birds"). Beatrice's dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly weight ("Sometimes scissors cut clean").

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The elevated register maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—any cosmic observer could narrate this. Phrases like "liminal space between endings and beginnings" and "threads of light older than time" read as generic mystical prose without character-specific voice. The POV remains stable but impersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective details like "razor edges" and technical focus appropriate to a clock shepherd.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains Elara's spatially-gifted perspective consistently, with perception filtered through her unique awareness of "patterns others missed."

No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent academic register with distinctive touches ("cardiac interruption," "clover melancholy"). The perceptual signature—seeing mathematics everywhere—fits Elena's character. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the discovery moment. Minor weakness: occasional drift into overly writerly constructions ("irony followed her like a personal shadow") that distance rather than immerse.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "melodically haunted" and atmospheric descriptions, creating a melancholic tone. Dialogue between Elias and Meredith feels functional but lacks distinctive character voices—both speak in similar registers. The piece suffers from filter-verb stacks ("Elias believed," "Elias understood," "Elias felt") that distance us from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with appropriate lexicon for an archivist ("proximate causes," "regenerated covenant"), and perception filters through his preservationist lens.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent ironic distance with phrases like "improbable as it was ambitious," but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the jocular tone.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm, and Elion's perceptual signature comes through in how he experiences the forest.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "confidently uncertain" and cosmic imagery. However, it lacks a distinctive perceptual signature—Elara's profession as a signal interpreter doesn't sufficiently color how she perceives her world beyond generic mystical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, contemplative voice appropriate to the material, with controlled distance that serves the ethereal tone. Phrases like "mapping the unspoken words that hung in the salt-tinged air like invisible threads" show distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "volcanic tenderness" creating a distinct texture, and POV remains stable throughout.

    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision meeting lyrical description ("the hush of the universe inhaling"). Elena's perceptual signature—experiencing the world through rhythm and vibration—is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains consistency with Marlo's perspective, using specific perceptual signatures like his ability to identify walks. Dialogue between Marlo and Vance feels natural with appropriate subtext, though the narrative occasionally drifts into slight overwriting ("arcane ritual").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.9)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled, meditative voice matching the guardian's calm nature. Strong rhythmic control in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception filtered through Mara's yearning ("water the color of mercury," "fragments of liquid moonlight").

The perceptual signature of noticing grace in mundane dock work effectively characterizes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theatrical register of narrated mundane acts ("With this deliberate incision") distinctly characterizes the performer's voice. POV remains stable and the formal diction suits the ritualistic nature. Some register drift occurs in expository passages about the mandate that shift toward sociological commentary rather than maintaining the performer's theatrical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks distinct personality—phrases like "testament to ancient craftsmanship" and "tapestry of interconnected moments" read as generic fantasy voice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions like "botanical dialogues shaped the very air" fitting the story's magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("golden shadows," "dust motes that danced like tiny spirits"). Some passages drift into elevated diction that strains the intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.6)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent erudite distance appropriate to Elias's scholarly perspective, with selective perception focused on patterns, measurements, and geometries. Dialogue between Elias and the visitor carries appropriate academic register and subtext of mutual recognition. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elias believed," "Elias hesitated") slightly dull immediacy, and both characters' voices converge too closely in register.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance for Elara's increasingly absorbed state. Diction fits an academic historian ("purifying," "collective consciousness"). However, voice lacks distinctive texture beyond competent literary register, and some phrases ("captured sunset," "amber silence") feel writerly rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "petal-soft leaves" and "shadow unbound," though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("luminous regret filled Elara") that strains POV plausibility. The perceptual signature of a "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" shapes selective attention to light and shadow patterns throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistency with nature-focused observations and gentle tone appropriate to the wildlife handler POV. However, the prose frequently drifts into abstract philosophizing ("comfortable narratives," "conscious choice made with eyes wide open") that reads more like essay than embodied perspective, particularly in peak reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency with Elara as focalizer, and her perceptual signature includes unique elements like hearing plant thoughts. However, the prose lacks distinct rhythm or syntax that would elevate voice—sentences follow similar patterns throughout without modulation for emotional intensity. Filter constructions like "she saw now" and "Elara understood now" accumulate, dulling immediacy in key revelation moments.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena's perceptual signature as someone who senses vibrations and navigates spatial imagination is consistent. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("quantum archive of feeling") that strains against the intimate POV. The voice maintains its lyrical quality but lacks rhythmic variation under supposed emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled celestial vocabulary, though it tends toward purple prose ("shadowed rapture," "nebulous concepts"). The perceptual signature focuses appropriately on cosmic and sensory details, but the prose rhythm becomes monotonous with repetitive "she [verb]" constructions and lacks modulation under supposed emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with poetic diction matching the surreal setting ("fractured lullaby of existence"), though some passages drift into elevated register beyond the guard's established lexicon ("infinite versions of reality, each more surreal than the last"). Dialogue between guard and Archivist carries subtle tension and subtext about presence versus absence. Perceptual signature could be more distinct—the guard's specific way of noticing isn't strongly differentiated.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains consistency with philosophical wonder and technical precision ("translocation," "crucible of transformation"). However, the prose occasionally elevates into abstract register ("probable miracles," "crystalline memories") that feels distant from embodied experience, particularly during what should be visceral moments of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "boundary between worlds grew thin as silk" creating atmospheric texture. Maris's limited dialogue feels appropriately sparse and weighted, though other guides remain voiceless, missing opportunities for distinction. The prose successfully modulates between mystical description and concrete action, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("waterfall of liquid twilight") without clear POV grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV maintains consistency with selective perception (focusing on musical/tactile details) and voice modulates appropriately under discovery. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("seraphically mundane") that slightly exceeds the bellhop's established lexicon, but perceptual signature remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains an elevated, mythic register appropriate to the fantasy setting ("diminutive titan moved with purposeful silence"). However, abstract phrasing dominates over concrete perception, and the POV lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond ornate description. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's scientific perspective shapes the narration with appropriate technical vocabulary and observational precision. The rhythm of "tapping" creates a consistent motif tied to her processing style. Some passages drift into elevated register ("sentinel," "ancient rhythms") that doesn't fully align with Marina's practical scientist voice, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in phrases like "barefoot stargazer padded silently" and "margin of daylight." However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond the character's established register ("thunderous serenity," "technological ambition"). The perceptual signature focuses appropriately on cosmic and tactile details, though interiority tends toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, and Maya's perceptual signature shows in how she reads the plants and volcanic energy. The voice modulates appropriately from contemplative to urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    The meditative voice suits Maya's cultivated stillness, with controlled rhythm in passages like "shoulders rising to ears, breath catching in throats, fingers knotting themselves." However, register occasionally drifts into clinical terminology that doesn't fully match a gardener's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm and atmospheric texture. The rhetorical questions effectively convey Eleanor's searching mental state and create a contemplative cadence. However, some passages drift into elevated diction that occasionally obscures clarity ("cloying sadness of failure settled deeper into her bones"), and the voice lacks the distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice combining scientific precision with poetic observation. The perceptual signature shows in details like seeing "how matter and perception bend under extreme conditions." Dialogue with the drone feels natural if minimal. Some filter verbs ("could see how") occasionally dull immediacy during the peak temporal displacement sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent close third with appropriate technical vocabulary for the cryogenic archivist POV. However, several phrases feel generic ("dizzying quiet," "bravely conflicted") and the repetition of prompt-required phrases disrupts natural voice flow.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "tranquil blaze" and careful botanical observation. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Rhiannon's supposed heightened perception doesn't manifest in how she notices or describes her world. The absence of dialogue removes an opportunity for voice distinction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register with controlled rhythm, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to the fisher's consciousness. Narrative distance remains too uniform—we never feel the texture of his particular mind under pressure, only the elevated narrative voice describing his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to Eleanor's background, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond general observation skills. Phrases like "devotedly observant" repeat mechanically, and the narration tends toward telling emotional states ("satisfying clarity") rather than embodying them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases ("meteor hush," "haunted firmware"), though some constructions feel writerly ("that profound quiet before cosmic impact"). The POV holds steady through Elias's deafness, using signing and vibrations effectively. Some register elevation in emotional peaks doesn't quite match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with selective perception focused on artistic and acoustic details fitting Silas's character. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("temple of respectful coexistence," "beautiful mysterious") that doesn't fully align with the established voice of a sidewalk chalk artist.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and filters perception through Elias's retrocognitive consciousness, creating a distinct texture of overlaid time. Diction appropriately elevates for the ritualistic tone while remaining accessible. The brief dialogue feels slightly stiff ("We are not the fire") but serves its thematic purpose. Some phrases like "aberrant mercy" feel more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice through synesthetic perception and theatrical vocabulary maintains consistency. POV remains stable with Silas, though some passages drift into elevated register ("sanctified ground," "threshold between worlds") that occasionally feels authorial rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond scientific observation. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise") without grounding in Maya's specific way of noticing. No dialogue to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya's perceptual signature comes through her sensory sensitivity ("residual energy left by sleeping humans") and professional lens viewing emotions as mappable terrain. The prose modulates from technical precision during equipment setup to wonder during the fossil encounter. The single line of dialogue "How can you float?" captures genuine awe, though the narrative occasionally over-explains what the dramatization already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything with equal clarity rather than filtering through her specific priorities as an hourglass turner. No dialogue appears to test character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinct perceptual signatures—a spy's habit of assessing trust in his own fingers, reading landscapes as tactical positions. Diction appropriately elevates during reflection ("vouchsafe," "crucible") while staying grounded in concrete observation. However, some passages drift into writerly abstraction ("where unused courage waits") that doesn't fully match Aleksandr's pragmatic spy mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and appropriate formality for the period setting. Voice maintains atmospheric texture through selective perception ("shifts in wind, patterns in fog") and measured syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a distinct meditative rhythm matching Kael's zen-potter consciousness with consistent POV control. Perceptual signature is strong—he sees circular movements, pottery parallels, and interprets through craft metaphors. Some phrases lean purple ("sharp gentleness" appears three times) but voice coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to Mara's character - "wistfully pragmatic heart," "liquid mercury." The prose rhythm supports the meditative pace.

POV remains stable in close third, though Jim's omniscience about Mara's grandmother creates a minor reliability issue.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the piece's accumulative nature. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elena notices reflections, resonances, and tides in character-specific ways. Some passages drift toward elevated abstraction ("whispered secret among the few") but the voice generally supports the meditative tone without losing specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "prismatic quiet" and nature observations. However, repetitive constructions plague the prose: "keeper of secrets" appears 5 times, "inevitably whimsical" 4 times, "after the cloud bursts" 4 times. No dialogue tests character distinction. The POV remains stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic whimsy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable but voice lacks distinction—Elara's perceptual signature as a signal interpreter doesn't meaningfully color the prose. Excessive filter constructions ("Elara knew," "she had discovered") distance us from immediacy, and the academic register doesn't modulate with emotional intensity during the climactic transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate interiority for Elara's experience. Some phrases feel overwrought ("cosmic possibility," "viscous" air) without earning their elevation through voice consistency. The narrative stance remains stable but lacks a distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate the voice beyond competent.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena's perceptual signature as someone who experiences the world through "shapes, shadows, and textures" creates a distinct POV with consistent focalization. The narrative maintains stable third-person limited perspective without head-hopping. However, dialogue lacks subtext and goal-pursuit, serving primarily as information exchange rather than action with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision appropriate to Eli's role. Strong moments like "the weight familiar against their chest" and selective perception of weather patterns. Dialogue between Eli and Dr. Aris feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some filter-heavy passages ("Eli had been nervously confident") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions and musical metaphors appropriate to a fiddler's perspective ("first chord in a symphony of pixelated amnesty"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("dimension where all contradictions harmonize") that strains the POV's grounding. No dialogue prevents character voice distinction, and the prose sometimes tells what could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with appropriate formality for Elias's character, though it lacks distinctive texture or rhythm. Dialogue between Elias and Marcus feels functional but wooden—Marcus exists only to deliver opposition ("Your father stole from people"). The piece relies heavily on summary and reflection without sufficient present-scene grounding, creating distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices what any astronomer would notice. Dialogue between Elara and Thorne reads functional but carries minimal subtext ("You've found it, haven't you?"). The prose doesn't modulate with emotional intensity during discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register appropriate to fantasy, with controlled psychic distance throughout the ritual. However, the voice lacks distinctiveness—this could be any competent fantasy narrator. POV remains stable, and the mythic tone suits the material, but perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, mystical diction appropriate to the fantastical premise. POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, the prose tends toward abstract exposition ("volatile waters of possibility") rather than embodied perception, and lacks the distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("Her fingers traced the gnarled tree roots that snaked between bones, a map only she could read"). Some register elevation occurs unnecessarily ("укрепed by the newly returned peace" appears to be a typo). POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice captures Marcus's expertise through technical vocabulary and maintains consistent close third-person POV. The perceptual signature works when focused on authentication details.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains scholarly precision appropriate to Elara's profession, with consistent psychic distance and clean free indirect style ("Yet how could she, a mere translator...").

The prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("accumulated thoughts and aspirations") but generally holds character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic-poetic register appropriate to the concept, with phrases like "wintersun serenity" and "after tomorrow disappears" creating atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "darkness that had settled like dust" and "monuments to humanity's expectation of ending." POV remains stable in close third. Some passages drift into elevated register ("latent radiance," "resonant hush") that feels slightly removed from the inspector's practical perspective, and the repeated "resonant hush" becomes a verbal tic.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with Elena's scientific precision filtering emotional material ("daringly methodical in her embrace of emotion"). The perceptual signature of a river chronicler shapes what she notices. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that doesn't fully match the established voice, and the lack of dialogue removes one potential dimension of voice work.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some texture ("diaphanous covering," "cryptic message") but lacks distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("velvet observatory," "perforated destiny") and consistent POV. The botanical consciousness adds perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, contemplative register appropriate to the mystical setting, though lacks distinct perceptual signature. Some filter-verb clusters ("she remembered," "she saw") and repetitive constructions ("she whispered," "she spoke") dull immediacy without serving pattern or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, slightly formal diction befitting Elian's professional distance ("conscience for hire," "ritualistic care"). The "sincerely insincere" quality manifests in the prose itself. Some passages drift toward over-writing ("wisps of smoke to mark its existence"), but the voice effectively modulates between professional observation and brief moments of introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a meditative register appropriate to the mystical teaching scene, but lacks distinctive character voices—both Elien and Maya speak in similar philosophical cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Kael notices everything with the same reverent tone regardless of emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains consistency with cosmic terminology and measured tone appropriate to the gravity. Dialogue between Loran and Korin feels natural and carries subtext about doubt versus faith. Some repetitive phrasing appears ("quiet enthusiasm" used 5 times, "stellar doubt" 3 times) that creates a drumbeat effect.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with consistent death-imagery ("skeletal hands," "dry leaves," "shadows made solid") that matches the reaper POV. Dialogue serves multiple functions—Elara's "The stars remember what we forget" both characterizes and foreshadows.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - the watcher notices everything with equal, measured attention.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture, defaulting to explanatory prose ("This was not just any brain but the key to...") rather than filtering through Maya's specific perceptual signature. Extended exposition about the clone custody battle and Great Unraveling creates distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—it reads as competent creative writing workshop prose without memorable texture.

Diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("trinity of possibility," "storm-born silence") that doesn't match a character actively engaged with physical objects.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice shows moments of distinction ("slick in his palm," "off-key wind") but suffers from register drift into elevated literary diction inconsistent with a leaf-blower operator: "profound silence amplifying the weight of the moment," "tapestry of ghostly melody."

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains an elevated, mythic register appropriate to the feral guardian's centuries of existence, with phrases like "patchwork illusion of connection" showing distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled diction like "ember nexus" and "dormant power." However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the prose could belong to any fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Elara notices what any "celestial signal interpreter" might notice.

    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance, though perceptual signature could be more distinctive. Voice modulates appropriately during the ritual sequence ("Follow me," she murmured). Some register elevation occurs unnecessarily ("fibrous veins pulsing with humanity's digital lifeblood") but doesn't contaminate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the digital ghost consciousness doesn't filter perception in unique ways.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with elegant, measured prose matching the storyteller's "quietly articulate" nature. POV remains stable throughout. However, the narrative distance creates emotional remove—we observe the storyteller rather than inhabiting his experience, limiting intimacy during crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with effective perceptual signature in how the carpenter notices craftsmanship details and interprets silence.

Elena's perceptual signature shows in how she notices light fracturing and silence accumulating. However, the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("conductor preparing to lead an unconventional orchestra") that slightly strains against the intimate POV, and dialogue remains minimal, limiting voice distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision appropriate to Elara's profession, though it occasionally drifts into overly elevated register ("rain-scoured fresco vault"). The perceptual signature focuses appropriately on visual details and patterns. However, the prose lacks rhythmic variation under pressure—discovery moments maintain the same measured cadence as setup, missing opportunities for syntactic acceleration.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with measured, analytical diction appropriate to Elara's character. Phrases like "unnerving familiarity" and "metaphysical threads" establish a distinct register. However, some passages slip into elevated literary prose that feels detached from Elara's embodied experience, particularly in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistent ethereal texture with phrases like "time stretches like taffy" and "driftingly alert," though diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The contemplative voice suits Elira's servant-observer role, with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization. However, several instances of elevated diction ("sanctuary," "inquisitive nature," "enigmatic facade") feel mismatched with a servant's likely lexicon, and the prose occasionally tells what could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.6)
    The academic register fits Elena's profession, and technical terminology about cloud types feels controlled. However, the prose often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("a translator of the sky's silent language") that distances us from immediate experience, and filter-heavy constructions dull key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent interiority with clear perceptual signature—Elara notices patterns, grain, light rather than faces. No dialogue preserves the meditative tone. Some filter verb accumulation ("she allowed herself to discover," "envisioning how") slightly dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture beyond "young apprentice" register. Phrases like "diligently curious" and "meticulously curious nature" create redundancy rather than deepening character voice. The POV filters observation competently but without the selective bias or perceptual signature that would make Eli's way of seeing memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains fairy-tale register consistently but lacks distinctive personality. Some effective rhythm in "Like driftwood on the shore of time" but also repetitive phrasing that feels mechanical. POV stable throughout, though interiority could be more character-specific rather than archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to the ghost's perspective, with phrases like "celestial doorways" and "brambled hope" creating texture. However, the narrative distance remains too removed—we never experience Aris's internal moment of discovering the messages or her conviction when sharing them. The ghost's omniscient view flattens potential tension from limited knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical register appropriate to the cosmic scope. Some passages achieve genuine beauty: "threads of fractured starlight and liquid shadow." However, abstract diction occasionally obscures immediacy ("vouchsafe the new phase of time"), and the lack of dialogue removes one tool for voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "graceless beauty" and "offhandedly exact" creating texture. POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("twilight painted the sky in hues of violet and amber") that doesn't match Elias's weathered caretaker perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable with clear access to Elara's scientific mindset ("the symphonically minded scientist"). The perceptual signature works well—she sees molecular patterns in natural phenomena consistently. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext. However, some interiority relies on tell-phrases like "struck her with unexpected force" rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm through phrases like "mindfully scattered fragments" and "crystalline fruits that pulsed with captured narratives." The perceptual signature focuses on translucent materials and captured essences in character-specific ways. Syntax varies purposefully between longer contemplative sentences and shorter action beats, though occasional repetition of "vendor" creates minor monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive touches like "coral icebound" and perceptual details filtered through Kael's chef perspective ("knives sharpened to a razor's edge"). No dialogue appears, which is acceptable. However, the voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—the prose maintains the same measured tone whether describing routine preparation or the climactic memory transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness - it reads as competent literary fiction without memorable texture. POV remains stable but filters everything through explanatory distance ("Elena recognized," "she understood") rather than immediate perception. The prose tells Elena's insights rather than showing them emerge through dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive vocabulary ("helix-minded," "synaptic plasticity") matching the engineer character. However, register drift occurs in elevated passages ("ethereal blues," "ancient and newborn"), and the narrative voice lacks sufficient perceptual signature beyond technical terminology. Internal thought remains mostly abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains consistency with academic precision appropriate to an archivist, though it lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond professional observation. Phrases like "prism-minded" and "clandestinely luminous" create texture but feel more like assigned attributes than organic voice. No dialogue appears, preventing full assessment of that dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinctive voice with controlled, lyrical prose that matches the story's contemplative tone. The perceptual signature is strong - Elara notices in musical terms ("symphonically minded"). Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("empathy in motion") feels slightly forced but doesn't break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with chess-master precision ("thoughtfully precise") and selective perception focused on patterns and strategic clarity. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("hopeful melancholy of his existence") that slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and philosophical tone appropriate to Elara's character, with specialized vocabulary around frequencies and vibration. However, prose frequently defaults to telling over showing ("moved with practiced grace," "theatrical sincerity never wavering"), and repetitive sentence structures create monotony, particularly in the middle section's catalog of her methods.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—it reads as competent fantasy prose without unique texture. Phrases like "olfactorily sensitive senses" and "turning of the tide's thought" feel artificially elevated rather than voice-driven. The POV remains stable but Elara's perceptual signature doesn't emerge distinctly; we get her observations but not her idiosyncratic way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrases like "whirling silence" and "silver serpents."

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains professional distance appropriate to Elena's investigator role, with technical precision in phrases like "wind sensors calibrated to extreme precision."

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the ritual's gravity, with strong perceptual signature through Eira's synesthesia.

The POV remains stable but occasionally drifts toward omniscient observation of the crowd.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to fantasy ("telluric energies," "boundary manipulation") and perceptual signature focused on sacred/ritual details. Some passages drift into overly abstract register ("the landscape of his failure played out before him in sound and light").

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's clinical voice modulates effectively from precise observation to cryptic invitation, with distinct perceptual signatures in how she counts stars and maps emotions. The brief dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit. Minor issues with Thomas's voice converging too closely with Elara's during the transfer, though this reads as intentional effect of the empathy borrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent access to Ayla's interiority, with controlled psychic distance. The voice modulates appropriately from anxious ("jittery," "instinctively touched") to confident ("no longer couriering artifacts, but delivering wonder itself"). However, register occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("This was precisely why..."), and the elderly traveler's dialogue lacks distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent mystical register but lacks distinct perceptual signature - Elara observes generically rather than through a specific consciousness. Phrases like "clutched the glass prism in her palm" and "her mind already racing" are serviceable but unremarkable. The voice doesn't modulate with the supposed emotional intensity of validation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "raveling silence" and "time's unraveling tapestry" creating textural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "dust motes danced" and "reality began to fray," creating appropriate texture for speculative fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a reticent observer ("had learned more from silence than from conversation"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary language inconsistent with a skipper's perspective ("imbued with the presence," "transcended his solitary existence").

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness beyond purple prose tendencies. POV control falters with the text corruption "室白鲟" and occasional register drift into overly literary diction ("swirling nebulas," "emerald beams"). No dialogue appears to test character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical distance with phrases like "valley-mist wonder" and selective perception focused on light and color. However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("narrative magnetism," "iridescent caution") that doesn't fully match a dye master's lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with Samuel's technical yet mystical perspective coloring descriptions like "quantified sorrow" and "resonance frequency." However, register drift appears in elevated moments ("arboreal consciousness," "millennia") that exceed a maintenance worker's plausible lexicon. The Chinese character "沉默地" appears inexplicably, breaking voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—descriptions could belong to any fantasy narrator. Heavy reliance on abstract constructions ("alchemical transformation was gradual but undeniable") over concrete sensory detail dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct texture, defaulting to elevated literary register without character-specific perception. Phrases like "nestled paradoxes that defined Eleanor's existence" and "enlarged tranquility" feel imposed rather than emerging from Eleanor's particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "creeping normality noticer" and selective perception of decay, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tenuous absolution settling"). The critical moment of reading the letter aloud lacks dialogue or free indirect discourse that would deepen POV immersion during the story's emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent formality befitting an orderly records chief, with controlled diction like "crystallized," "ethereal," "meticulous." However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature - Elias notices everything with equal, undifferentiated attention rather than through a specific lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent control with phrases like "the comforting unease of the market settled around her like a familiar cloak," though some passages lean toward explanatory summary. The perceptual signature of someone attuned to criminal undercurrents comes through in her observation of "suspicion in his step."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature through scientific observation filtered by growing wonder. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in sensory descriptions. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("terrestrially cosmic" feels forced) and the storm man's overly portentous dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistent POV with some evocative phrases like "charcoal-fingered" and "auroral sorrow," but relies on filter-heavy constructions ("he knew would be there," "he had first found"). The perceptual signature focuses on visual/tactile details befitting an artist, though emotional states are often told rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent register with selective perception ("zinc-etched," "oilcloth") reflecting Elara's craft expertise. Some filter-verb clustering ("she believed," "she whispered," "she finally understood") dulls immediacy in reflection passages. The perceptual signature of a truth-sensitive artisan comes through in how she reads artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains distance without revealing Elara's specific perceptual signature—her way of noticing remains generic despite her unique sensitivity to vibrations. Voice lacks distinct texture in syntax or rhythm; phrases like "symphonies of truth" and "color of wonder" repeat without variation. The prose tells of Elara's exceptional perception but doesn't embody it through selective, biased observation unique to her expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to an android consciousness. The "містул" typo disrupts, but overall the prose captures machine perception with organic undertones ("strangely organic fingers danced"). Perceptual signature evident in how Unit 734 processes both data ("Protocol 34") and sensation ("fragments of human children laughing").

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with Leo as focalizer, though his perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—we rarely sense his specific curatorial expertise shaping what he notices.

The narrative stance stays stable without head-hopping, though opportunities for more distinctive voice texture are missed.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the underwater setting, with phrases like "purposeful grace" and "ancient, familiar energy."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and filters architectural observations through Clara's specific perception. However, dialogue lacks naturalistic rhythm and subtext, with Mr. Abernathy speaking in overly articulate exposition regardless of emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "tragically radiant with eyes that held the sorrow of forgotten civilizations," though register occasionally drifts elevated beyond necessity.

    The voice lacks distinct texture, reading as generic fantasy-poetic without character-specific perception. Heavy filter verb usage ("she sensed," "she knew," "she began to understand") dulls immediacy, and the POV's lexicon feels borrowed from template fantasy rather than emerging from this specific consciousness observing this specific world.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically rather than through a specific ghost-whisperer's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The meditative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "scintillatingly somber" and selective perception focused on patterns, though it occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("This was his pilgrimage—not to seek answers"). The lack of dialogue prevents voice distinction testing, but the perceptual signature of seeing hidden geometries everywhere is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but reads as distant chronicle rather than close psychic access to Elias's experience.

The prose lacks the distinct perceptual signature and selective attention that would elevate voice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with phrases like "feral loft" and "gleaned redemption" maintains consistency, though some elevated diction ("inextricable yearning," "sensory experience") occasionally drifts from the established register.

The narrative distance remains too steady, never modulating with emotional intensity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains professional investigator register with selective perception ("greenish patina," "water displacement levels"), but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntax. Internal observations feel competent but generic—"analytical mind," "empirical observation"—without unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent limited third-person with appropriate psychic distance, and Father Michael's clerical background colors his perception ("penitentiary chaplain," "ministry," "repenting").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    Voice maintains consistency in its contemplative register but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the sentinel notices autumn and couples generically without character-specific selection. Free indirect style is clean but monotonous, with repetitive "He [verb]" constructions creating template cadence. The prose reads like averaged philosophical musing rather than a singular perspective shaped by this character's specific history.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but suffers from elevated register drift ("liminal spaces," "consecrate," "ley lines") that reads more like fantasy exposition than character perception. No dialogue appears to test naturalism. POV remains stable but the perceptual signature is generic—any mystical practitioner could narrate these observations.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance and filters description through Elara's archival perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with scholarly diction appropriate to Elara's character.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eleanor's perceptual signature shows in phrases like "iridescent luminescence" and "shrewdly innocent," maintaining a scholarly-yet-open voice. The narrative distance remains stable in close third.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent focalization but voice lacks distinction—the prose could describe any literary protagonist without character-specific perception.

However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("geography of self," "territories of his heart") that feels less grounded than the concrete imagery, and some repetitive phrasing appears ("shadowed garden" used 6 times).

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the fantasy setting. Perceptual signature shows in how Elorian notices patterns and hypothesizes constantly. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the flawed genesis of their civilization") that distances from immediate experience, and some repetitive phrasing ("hypothesizing about") becomes a verbal tic rather than meaningful characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya's POV maintains consistency with selective perception reflecting her firefighter training and emotional state. The prose modulates between urgent action and reflective moments, though some passages drift into elevated register ("kelp-drift peace") that doesn't fully align with the character's voice. Internal thought remains coherent, but occasional filter-heavy constructions ("Maya saw not just her own face but the legacy") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains mystical register consistently ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience") with controlled rhythm, but lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Elara observes generically rather than through a unique lens. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("defiant hush deepened") that doesn't fully match the character's practical mission.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    The elevated, distant voice maintains consistency but lacks personality or specificity. Phrases like "otherworldly sentimentalist" and "cosmic consciousness" create atmosphere but no distinct perceptual signature. The prose serves the cosmic scale but sacrifices intimacy and character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and meditative tone appropriate to Elias's craft, with rhythmic control in phrases like "thundering calm" and "fiercely meditative focus." However, perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—Elias notices what any gravestone carver might notice. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unsettled spirits," "ancient rhythm") that feels writerly rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture, reading as generic literary fiction. POV control is stable though interiority relies on abstract declarations ("a tangible peace born of collective responsibility"). Dialogue is minimal and functional, missing subtext or character-specific rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent dreamy register appropriate to Elias's gentle nature and nocturnal ritual. Phrases like "velveteen gloom" and "cobalt walls absorbing sound" create distinctive atmosphere, though some descriptions edge toward purple prose without always serving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice remains consistent but generic, lacking distinct perceptual signature. Phrases like "her specialty was charting not what was known, but what was yet to be discovered" read as conceptual exposition rather than embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narration maintains third-person limited but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the copyist notices everything with equal, detached clarity. Prose relies on telling phrases like "revolutionary nature" and "subversive act" rather than showing through selective attention. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent close third-person but lacks distinct voice texture—Elena's interiority reads generic rather than character-specific. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("haunting memories," "profound destruction") without idiosyncratic perception. No dialogue to evaluate voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction beyond philosophical abstraction. Repetitive sentence structures ("Milo lived," "Milo ran," "Milo's fingers") create monotony. The POV filters everything through intellectual analysis rather than embodied perception, missing opportunities for sensory specificity that would distinguish this particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice is competent but generic - Eleanor's perspective lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic control. Dialogue appears minimally and serves exposition ("Each rehearsal begins the same way") rather than pursuing goals with subtext. The narration maintains consistent distance but without character-specific texture in diction or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with philosophical, contemplative tone appropriate to character. Perceptual signature exists ("taste memories") but remains underutilized. The dialogue to plants feels forced rather than natural character expression. Prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal glow," "synaptic plasticity") that clashes with the "informally wise" characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Elara with appropriate access to her involuntary thoughts, and dialogue differentiates characters adequately. However, several instances of filter-verb stacking ("she muttered," "Elara nodded," "Elara sighed") dull immediacy, and the narrative voice occasionally drifts into explanatory modes that feel detached from Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("noticed when things went slowly wrong"). However, interiority often tells rather than embodies ("This gift made her sensitive"), and several passages drift into elevated diction that feels performative rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, though the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spectral forms," "resonant satisfaction") that doesn't match the diving context. The statue's telepathic voice is effectively distinguished through formal diction. Some filter-verb accumulation ("watched as," "felt something") dulls immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices things generically rather than through a mathematician's specific lens. Phrases like "grim optimism" and "balancedly daring" feel artificially inserted rather than organic to his voice. No dialogue prevents character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with contemplative rhythm and selective perception focused on artistic and linguistic details. Some passages drift into elevated register ("tributaries of a great river") that doesn't match the contemporary urban setting, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains cultured, historically-oriented perspective with consistent elevated diction ("cavernous expanse," "hive-mind consciousness"). Khira's terse dialogue ("The bread remembers") contrasts effectively with the guide's genteel speech. Minor issues with occasional register elevation ("决心" appears to be an error).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "slow exhale of low tide" creating atmospheric texture. POV remains stable in close third. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("latent radiance," "bleak exhilaration") that feels prompted rather than organic to Esme's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains mystical register appropriately, with controlled diction like "unbosom" creating period atmosphere. The whispering advisor's dialogue feels somewhat stilted ("The universe has prepared paradoxical notes"), lacking naturalistic subtext. POV remains stable in close third, though perceptual signature could be more distinctive beyond the curse effect.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond mystical observation. POV modesty fails when the narrator claims the prophet can see "patterns visible only to her eyes" and control weather through sound without establishing how we know this.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate formality for the fantasy setting. Strong perceptual signature in how Kael reads the shells. Some filter-verb clustering ("Kael had spent years," "His father had believed") dulls immediacy in places, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    The academic voice suits Eleanor but lacks distinctive texture or modulation under discovery's pressure. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("emotionally rational," "methodically") and exposition-heavy narration creates distance. No dialogue appears to test character voice, and the prose maintains a uniform register throughout without reflecting Eleanor's emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent POV with selective perception fitting a surveyor's precision ("contours of submerged walkways"). However, several phrases feel overwritten ("hushed blaze," "archeologist of abandoned dreams" repeated) and the voice occasionally drifts toward purple prose rather than maintaining the character's technical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains consistent formality appropriate to Elias's profession but lacks distinctive texture—phrases like "dappled resolve" and "reclaimed stillness" feel imposed rather than organic to his perspective. No dialogue appears, and the perceptual signature remains generic (noting "minute details" without showing what specifically distinguishes his way of seeing).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains consistency with controlled, crafted prose matching the protagonist's artisan nature, and the perceptual signature focuses appropriately on luminous details and careful movements. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal substance," "architectural paradox") that feels slightly removed from the intimate grief being explored.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond plot-functional observations. Phrases like "intangibly tangible" appear multiple times without variation, and the narrative voice defaults to explanatory mode rather than embodying Elias's specific way of seeing his broken world.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Maya's drone operator background, though lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond competence. "Perpetually surprised expression widening" and similar constructions feel externalized rather than filtered through Maya's specific consciousness. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on craftsmanship details and memory. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("temple of his trade," "empire on the shifting sands") that feels disconnected from Martin's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency but lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Lyra notices generic details like "mist swirled like forgotten ghosts" rather than negotiator-specific observations. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("I brought what you requested") without subtext or character-revealing rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with maritime metaphors and selective perception fitting Elena's navigator background. Free indirect style is clean, though some passages drift toward explanatory ("This was her world now, a diminished echo..."). The perceptual signature of seeing terrestrial markers as celestial bodies is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "delicately robust" and "jaded wonder" but relies on template constructions ("For three days," "For a month after"). The single line of dialogue feels wooden. Filter-heavy narration ("I could finally see," "I realized," "I wondered") creates distance during what should be immediate moments.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent lyrical voice with controlled diction ("moon-kissed trees," "cosmic intimacy") that maintains fairy-tale register throughout. The prose modulates effectively during transformation, shifting from contemplative to incantatory. Some moments edge toward purple prose but generally serve the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistency with elevated, mystical diction appropriate to the cartomancer's perspective, though it tends toward abstract philosophical register ("choking beauty," "willingly perplexed") rather than embodied perception. The prose rhythm remains fairly uniform without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice remains consistent but lacks distinct texture, defaulting to elevated literary register throughout. "The spectral ghost of Earth just a dim memory" and similar constructions feel overwrought. No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature doesn't sharpen under the pressure of the dimensional crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with philosophical undertones appropriate to Ian's character, though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cosmic alignment of purpose and presence"). Dialogue feels somewhat stilted ("The elders said you would come"), and the perceptual signature could be more distinct during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains consistent formal register appropriate to Elias's sentinel role, with controlled perception reflecting his vigilant nature. The Chinese character "联络" appears to be an error rather than intentional code, disrupting voice coherence. Dialogue between Elias and the Keeper carries appropriate subtext about their conspiracy, though more distinct speech patterns would strengthen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on mathematical and natural patterns, though some passages drift into elevated register ("cosmic seams," "ethereal glow") that doesn't fully match the grounded eel herder persona. The controlled rhythm during stone placement effectively modulates with rising tension, but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Consistent limited third POV with appropriate psychic distance and some distinct perceptual signatures ("storm-kissed wonder," "rarefied air"). However, register occasionally drifts into academic territory ("systematic erasure," "atmospheric lies") that strains against the poet's voice. The prose maintains good rhythm under pressure but lacks the fully distinctive texture needed for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent academic register appropriate to the philosopher protagonist. Some distinctive touches like "dignified chaos" and "dimensional fencing" create texture. Dialogue between professor and student feels natural though lacks compelling subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains poetic consistency with controlled diction ("cerebral cathedral," "Phoenix feathers") appropriate to a poet-narrator, and perceptual signature shows through selective attention to decay and beauty. However, several lines slip into explanatory register ("Time moved differently when your identity shifted like moon phases") that tells rather than embodies, and the lack of dialogue removes a key voice-testing opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions ("melodies flowing like dreams") and selective perception focused on time and music. The prose modulates effectively between contemplative passages and urgent action. Some register elevation occurs ("liminal space," "manifested as art") that slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-naturalistic register with selective perception ("threads of magic," "ancient power"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization—Elara knows the stakes but discovers the cave's interior fresh. The "empirically whimsical" perspective colors observations like "every flower in bloom as if celebrating." Minor weakness: some filter phrases ("seemed to") dilute immediacy during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.5)
    The slow-spoken cadence and contemplative voice suit the protagonist, with effective free indirect style ("There it is"). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("cerulean regret," "transcendent beauty"), and the perceptual signature could be more distinct beyond the measured pace.

    The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends scientific precision with poetic observation. Diction remains within the character's plausible lexicon. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though a slight convergence in descriptive stems prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive quality fitting a glass artist. The prose effectively filters the world through her specialized perception. A slight deduction for a moment of near-expository summary regarding her shifted motivation, which briefly interrupts the immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on heat, light, and vibration. Diction remains within Elena's expertise, and syntactic control supports the accumulative rhythm. The phrase "unshaken marvels" repeats, but this feels intentional as a thematic callback rather than a voice convergence. No head-hopping; the internal voice is coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, weary voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that supports the tone. No head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and carries subtext, advancing the plot. The prose rhythm is controlled under pressure.

    The third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Elara's spiritually curious nature.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature that reflects Elara's designer mindset and altered states. Prose rhythm and syntax modulate effectively with the rising pressure of the quaking reveries. A single, minor instance of summary ("Days after her experience...") briefly flattens the otherwise impeccable focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and consistently filtered through Elara's perceptive, urgent consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("staggering grace," "dust motes danced").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptive signature filtered through Kael's unique consciousness. The prose is purposefully dense and lyrical, taught early and paid off at closure. A minor deduction for occasional moments of elevated diction that slightly strain the POV's lexicon in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lillian's specific, professional perception of light and time. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the urgency of the golden hour ("Time was accelerating"). The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, serving to distract the stationmaster. A minor deduction for one instance of potentially non-idiomatic phrasing ("捕捉 in paint"), which slightly disrupts the voice's consistency, though it is a single word in an otherwise controlled narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable and effective with a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative voice is consistent, and the dramatic narration is a character-motivated trait. However, occasional register drift into elevated diction ("giving form to air") slightly clashes with the POV's established lexicon in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature ("stars peeked through broken skylight casting ethereal patterns"). Voice modulates under pressure without convergence. Internal thought formatting is consistent; purposeful elision (The Production's details) imposes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature perfectly matched to the oracle's role. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exemplary. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature. Diction and syntax reflect Elias's thoughtful, measured nature. The apprentice's brief dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though its impact is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, scientific filter. The prose is controlled, though a minor register drift occurs in phrases like "velocity of discovery," which feels slightly elevated for the character's internal voice at closure. Elision is purposeful and legible.

    POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("liminal threshold," "unstruck chords") that reflects a musician's consciousness. The prose has a lyrical, rhythmic texture suited to the subject. A minor register drift ("暧昧 possibility") is a small artifact but does not significantly obscure clarity or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptive, analytical signature fitting the metaphysicist POV. The prose successfully carries the elevated concept. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the peak beat describing the aurora ("ethereal banners of green and violet"), which momentarily leans slightly decorative against the otherwise precise narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and filtered through Marcus's professional, skeptical lens. The prose has a distinct texture, with a rhythmic control that modulates into shorter, more potent sentences during the vision peak ("workers vanishing... secrets buried..."). The internal voice remains coherent under pressure, though the radio psychic's dialogue is slightly less distinct than Marcus's rich interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that modulates effectively between the river's rush and the library's sigh. The prose possesses a strong rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature. Minor register drift occurs in the peak beat ("nurturing embrace" feels slightly soft for the voice), preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable and deeply filtered through Maya's perceptual signature, with a distinct lyrical rhythm that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when it appears, carrying significant subtext.

Occasional diction sameness and repeated constructions dilute peak intensity. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    A consistent, gothic‑lyric first‑person voice sustains mood and filters detail with a distinct perceptual bias. Dialogue is purposeful but occasionally expository, fitting the incantatory mode. No POV slippage; temporal control is clean. Rhythmic variety mostly holds, with a few elevated phrasings trending purple but not derailing legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    A controlled, lyrical third‑person voice with consistent distance and a distinct sensory palette. Rhythmic modulation suits the tide‑watch cadence; no head‑hopping or register slips. Occasional repetition leans ornamental but doesn’t cloud clarity. The perceptual signature feels owned by the figure’s vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is steady and controlled; diction is consistent with a reverent, craft-focused sensibility. The voice has cadence and image (“spiral grooves,” “sunwashed sky”), though it leans into telling in the reveal. No dialogue; narrative confidence stays within what Kael can infer. A bit more texture under stress would sharpen the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable and appropriate; the mildly elevated, archival diction suits a precise historian. Voice is consistent, if more formal than sensorial at peaks, and avoids head-hopping. Compression is clean with no contrived withholding. Rhythm could vary more at the discovery to amplify charge.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence; diction suits a meticulous, reflective craftsman. Rhythmic control is steady, with a few heightened phrases that risk purple but largely remain within voice. No head‑hopping or stance drift. The “Tomorrow” triad provides intentional cadence without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single‑POV control is stable, diction consistent with a meticulous archivist. The voice carries a calm, observant cadence that suits the material. Repetitions (“tranquilly perceptive,” “dappled resolve,” “reclaimed stillness”) create a slight template feel and dilute precision. No dialogue to test modulation or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lyrical third-person close is controlled, with consistent diction tied to craft and light. Rhythm modulates well from patient workbench detail to the quiet culmination in the basilica. No head-hopping or register slips; elisions are purposeful. A few luminous adjectives cluster but do not flatten the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV remains steady in a controlled close third; diction matches a precise, technical mind without sliding into corporate jargon. Rhythms are clean, with a few memorable lines anchoring images. Repetition of set phrases (“through perturbation theory,” “bleak exhilaration,” “intangibly tangible”) dulls texture at peaks. Overall voice is competent and coherent but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains cleanly inside Maya with consistent distance and lyric control. Diction suits a trained operator leaning into wonder, with rhythmic modulation toward the climax. Repetition of “perpetually surprised” edges toward a tic but doesn’t break voice. No head‑hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third‑person voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly educated for this character; perception is filtered through his craft and guilt. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and focalization never leaks. No dialogue is needed; interiority carries action. Occasional elevated diction skirts purple but largely serves tone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent in a close third to Lyra, with clean dialogue mechanics. Some lines tip into declarative thesis‑speak in dialogue, slightly flattening subtext. Rhythm suits the hush and builds toward the ritual cadence. Minor certainty about Rennett’s internal understanding is inferred but not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is steady and apt; diction fits a fallen professional with a lyric tilt. Voice modulates from rueful to lightly hopeful with control. Occasional clichés (“cloak of regrets,” “houses of cards,” “true north”) dilute distinctiveness. Overall reliable, if not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent first‑person voice with lyrical cadence and a discernible perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the younger self’s line turns the premise cleanly. Occasional diction stiffness and explanatory phrasing pull against immediacy. The voice mostly holds under pressure without head‑hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyric third-person close is consistent, with a distinct sensory lexicon and controlled cadence. Dialogue is spare and carries mythic subtext without over-explaining. The voice modulates at peaks (glyphs, apparition) while remaining legible. Occasional elevated phrasing flirts with purple but generally serves the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    A consistent close third with a distinct lyric texture; diction and rhythm feel controlled and apt for the fable‑like mode. Refrains (“willingly perplexed,” “choking beauty”) create patterning without breaking distance control, though they edge toward mannerism. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elision is purposeful. Modest modulation under pressure keeps legibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    A consistent, lyrical third-person close carries controlled cadence and a distinct perceptual signature (spiritual-technical diction). Modulation aligns with pressure—sentences lengthen and brighten as the portal opens without losing clarity. No head-hopping or stance leakage; the single whispered line fits voice and moment. Slight over-elevation at times, but largely voice-true.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyric third-person POV is steady and legible, with a controlled, contemplative register. Repetition of set phrases (“vibrant hush,” “slow dance”) creates a clear pattern but risks monotony. Dialogue is spare and functional, with no head‑hopping. Voice is confident if a touch generic at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    The elevated, controlled voice matches Elias’s measured competence and the clandestine mood; POV is stable and focused. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext and status. Diction is occasionally lush but remains within the world’s idiom. Rhythm modulates well across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a controlled cadence and image-led thinking. The perceptual filter (mathematics, constellations, eels) is character-specific and steady. No head-hopping or stance slips, and modulation at the climax is clean. A few generalized lines edge toward exposition but do not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Consistent close third with a controlled lyric register that fits Maia’s sensibility; the “perceptual signature” centers optics, maps, and weather. Rhythm varies enough to carry momentum, and the single spoken word lands with intent. A few grand abstractions push toward purple, but POV integrity holds. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV and stance are steady, with a controlled elevated diction fitting Aris. Dialogue is clean and functional, though it leans declarative rather than subtextual. Prose modulates rhythmically and keeps focalization tight. No head-hopping or unjustified elision.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent to the POV; rhythm modulates with soft intensifications toward closure. Diction and imagery (“luminous fracture,” “Builder/Gatherer”) feel specific to the character’s psyche. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; quoted lines are sparing and purposeful. Minor risk of uniform elevation, but it remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close with a controlled, lyrical cadence suits the character and world. Diction remains consistent and purposeful; the narrative maintains POV modesty without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well from concourse lyricism to the focused tactility of the archive sequence. Occasional declarative summary registers as expedient rather than flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable and confident, with a lucid, lyrical narrative stance that matches Elara’s perception. Diction is elevated but coherent with the mythic frame and remains within the narrator’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates well from trek to ritual to release. No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge artifices.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Consistent single‑POV lyric voice with controlled cadence and perceptual signature rooted in ritual and craft. Diction and rhythm mostly serve mood under pressure. Minor purple glints and the “RBG hands” error nick polish. The voice remains coherent through the climax and denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the voice is appropriately contemplative for the character. However, the narrative relies heavily on expository interiority ("Elena realized that...", "Elena knew she had found..."), which tells the reader her conclusions instead of letting them emerge purely from her perceptions and actions within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    The point of view is stable and the voice has a consistent lyrical texture. However, the elevated, philosophical register often feels misaligned with a character recovering from a traumatic attack. The prose remains polished and distant even when describing trembling hands and fear, creating a disconnect between the narrated emotional state and the narrative voice itself.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a suitable contemplative distance. The voice is clear, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on recurring labels ("The capsize survivor," "unshaken marvels") rather than developing a unique texture. This repetition flattens the voice and makes it feel more like a generic narrator than a specific consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a consistent and melancholic voice that befits the protagonist. The narrative distance is well-controlled, and perceptions feel character-specific, as in "Fish scattered like silver thoughts." The prose has a distinct, dignified rhythm that remains stable even as the setting shifts from the mundane to the fantastic. There are no POV slips or unearned knowledge reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, keeping the focus tightly on Elias's perspective and knowledge. The narrative voice is steady and appropriate for the character's gravitas. Dialogue is functional and advances the plot efficiently. While the prose is clear and controlled, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic dynamism that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the mystical subject matter. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through an artist's sensibilities. Psychic distance is managed effectively, drawing the reader into Elara's internal, transformative experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent throughout. The narrative voice is intelligent and fits the protagonist, but it sometimes leans heavily on conceptual jargon ("retrocognitively," "hyperbolic geometry"), which keeps the reader at a slight analytical distance. While clean, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would make the voice memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often resorting to generic phrasing ("Her motivation burned bright," "surge of hope mixed with urgency"). The prose is functional but does not feel uniquely filtered through the protagonist's specific mindset under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent lyrical and melancholic tone that suits the material. The third-person limited POV is handled cleanly for most of the story, creating a strong perceptual signature for Kael. The score is slightly limited by the voice's shift from showing to telling in the final paragraphs, where it becomes more explanatory and less grounded in immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece maintains a consistent and lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light and ephemera. The narrative voice is controlled, modulating gracefully from the tension of the heist to the quiet awe of the discovery. Dialogue is sparse but effective, revealing character through subtext and goal-oriented deception.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistently maintained, with the "dramatically narrating" tic serving as a strong character signature. The controlled shift in the final line from a dramatic to a quiet tone is an excellent piece of craft that reinforces the story's closure. However, the voice is often co-opted for thematic exposition, which creates a slight register mismatch between a character processing his reality and an author explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice often feels more authorial and lyrical than grounded in the perspective of a terrified stunt double. Phrases like "ethereal patterns," "cascading starlight," and "determination forged in transformative betrayal" create a distance, suggesting a narrator describing Maya's experience rather than inhabiting it. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to her profession or phobias.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is distinct, elevated, and lyrical, fitting the archetypal character. The perceptual signature is consistently focused on texture, absence, and silence, which reinforces character and theme. While the prose rhythm is somewhat uniform, the overall control and consistency are of a very high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, employing a precise, slightly formal register that perfectly suits a sentient machine grappling with existential questions. The point of view remains tightly controlled, and the robot's perceptual signature—noticing details with "calculated precision" while processing profound cosmic ideas—is unique and sustained. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, from the quiet echoes of its treads to the crescendo of the music.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the narrative voice—measured, observant, and quiet—perfectly matches the protagonist and her world. The prose has a distinct, consistent texture, and the psychic distance is managed well, drawing closer during moments of discovery. The piece demonstrates strong command over its narrative stance without any unmotivated shifts or slips.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is masterful—measured, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the contemplative tone. POV is maintained with discipline, filtering every observation through Elias's unique perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, reflecting the quiet intensity of his ritual and the deep calm of his conviction. The single line of dialogue carries significant weight, arriving with clarity and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency and control. However, the narrative voice is weakened by a reliance on recurring, prompt-like phrases ("subdued awakenings," "holographic principles," "mechanically warm"). This repetition gives the prose a templated, artificial quality that prevents the development of a truly distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice. The perceptual signature fits the artistic character. The inclusion of the untranslated Chinese word "暧昧" is a bold but potentially jarring choice that risks breaking the narrative immersion for a reader unfamiliar with it. While it fits thematically (ambiguity), it feels more like an authorial flourish than a natural part of this specific character's internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, literary, and perfectly suited to a "metaphysicist" character, with a strong perceptual signature focused on margins and anomalies. The point of view is disciplined and maintains a consistent psychic distance that supports the intellectual and melancholic tone. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, capturing both the stillness of observation and the urgency of discovery without any unmotivated shifts or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice effectively captures the blend of a practical explorer with a hidden sensitivity to the uncanny. Psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close during the visionary climax without losing narrative clarity. The voice is distinct and serves the story's aims well.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and perfectly matched to the story's mythic, detached tone. A distinct perceptual signature is established early ("Their grip on reality, always loose") and maintained throughout, filtering all descriptions. The prose has a deliberate, lyrical rhythm that enhances the atmosphere without sacrificing clarity. POV control is absolute, with a psychic distance that feels purposeful and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control. The narrative voice is gentle and consistent with Maya's character, but it lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally relying on standard therapeutic or sentimental phrasing. Dialogue is minimal but functional, though Lila's final, perfectly articulated words feel slightly too polished for the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    The point of view is consistent, and the voice maintains a distinct, elegiac tone that fits the story. The narrative prose has a deliberate, almost incantatory rhythm. The primary weakness is the repetitive use of key phrases ("odd historian," "bronze quiet," "sensitively perceptive"), which sometimes creates a scaffold-like feel, slightly flattening the narrative voice rather than deepening it through variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's mythic, elevated tone. The psychic distance is well-controlled for a descriptive, reflective piece. The primary weakness is that the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; it often reads as a high-level authorial summary of the character's state rather than a deep dive into his unique, idiosyncratic way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, with a formal, measured voice that aligns with the priest's intellectual and methodical character. The prose has a distinct texture and psychic distance is well-managed. The voice is effective and professional, though it stops short of developing a truly unique or surprising perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, and the voice possesses a distinct lyrical and contemplative quality that perfectly suits the protagonist. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader into the character's intense internal experience. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering all sensory details through the writer's unique "homesick" consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.7)
    Point of view is controlled and consistent, maintaining a close third-person perspective without deviation. The narrative voice is clear and functional, effectively conveying the concepts and emotional state. However, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic character, occasionally relying on familiar phrasing ("gift and curse," "cracks in reality") that keeps it from feeling uniquely individual to this character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Point of view is controlled and stable, effectively immersing the reader in Eleanor's soundless world by prioritizing the sense of touch and vibration. The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly lyrical tone appropriate for the story. While the prose is clean and purposeful, it lacks a highly distinct rhythmic signature that would elevate it from proficient to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct signature. It is significantly hampered by the verbatim repetition of thematic phrases, which feel like authorial intrusions rather than organic parts of the character's voice. The interiority often slips into diagnostic self-explanation, dulling the prose's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency and control, maintaining a melancholic and wistful voice appropriate for the character. Psychic distance is stable, and the narrative lens is tightly focused on Elias's perceptions. The voice has a clear texture, though it occasionally drifts toward a more generic literary prose rather than a highly specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is consistent, and the lyrical, contemplative voice is well-suited to the story's aims. The psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader into the poet's meditative state. The prose, however, lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes leaning on familiar poetic phrasing ("tapestry of... constellations," "fingers dancing") rather than forging a unique sensory language for this specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, melancholic tone appropriate for the story. However, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally relying on familiar lyrical phrasing ("tapestry of sound"). The dialogue is purely functional, serving as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than revealing character through subtext or naturalistic speech.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the narrative voice is consistent with Elias's meticulous character. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, often slipping into an explanatory mode that describes his philosophy rather than inhabiting his specific, in-the-moment worldview. It is competent and clear, but stops short of being immersive or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is generally consistent with the character's "cautious exuberance." However, toward the end, the narrative distance collapses, and the voice shifts from Elias's perspective to that of an omniscient author summarizing the story's meaning. This loss of focalization weakens the story's final moments by prioritizing thesis over character.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, ethereal tone appropriate for the setting. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Elara, effectively grounding the fantastical elements in her emotional reality. The prose has a distinct rhythm, though at times it becomes slightly uniform in its cadence, and the final lines of dialogue feel more like a prepared speech than spontaneous utterance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is controlled and consistent throughout, with no technical errors. The narrative voice is clear and appropriate for the story's epic fantasy tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; it is more of a capable, transparent lens on the events than a memorable character voice in its own right, missing an opportunity to filter the world through the unique eye of a "natural history illustrator."

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the magical subject matter. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara’s focused, methodical mind. While effective, the psychic distance remains somewhat formal, observing her emotions rather than fully inhabiting their visceral, contradictory texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits the solitary, observant protagonist. The voice is distinct, with a formal, almost reverent rhythm and diction ("kindly methodical grace," "reverence") that feels authentic to a former preservationist. This perceptual signature remains stable even as the internal stakes rise, creating a cohesive and immersive narrative experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Elara’s scientific background. The prose is clean and controlled. The primary weakness is a psychic distance that remains somewhat static; the voice doesn't fully reflect the internal turmoil of a collapsing worldview, relying more on description than a stressed perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with control, and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent with the “wryly earnest” descriptor. The dialogue is functional, serving its purpose to advance the plot, though the old woman’s lines are a bit direct. The overall voice successfully carries the story’s tone of weary resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and well-suited to the mystical, contemplative tone of the story. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Elara, and her perceptual signature—initially attuned to patterns, later to chaotic harmonies—is distinct and drives the narrative. The prose has a clear rhythmic control that modulates effectively as the magical event intensifies, maintaining clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the elevated, lyrical voice is consistent with the story's mythic tone. Psychic distance is stable. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; it feels more like a dispassionate chronicler describing Elina's experience rather than inhabiting her specific, biased way of seeing the world. The prose is clean and controlled but remains somewhat impersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, slightly elevated voice appropriate for the character. The narrative is clear and focused. The voice's distinction is somewhat dulled by repeated, generic phrasing like "trembling certainty" and "sensed rather than understood," which prevent it from achieving a truly unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the lyrical voice supports the story's gentle, meditative tone. However, the prose is marked by a distinct lack of a unique perceptual signature, feeling more generic than character-particular. The voice is further weakened by the verbatim repetition of key phrases, which functions less as a motif and more as a distracting verbal tic that flattens the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistently maintained with a fittingly formal, epic tone. Psychic distance is well-controlled, avoiding any unmotivated shifts or head-hopping. While technically proficient, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, reading as a competent but somewhat generic narrator for this genre rather than a uniquely characterized one.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Point of view is stable and controlled, with a clean narrative distance appropriate for the procedural nature of the plot. The voice is competent and clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or memorable rhythm. It serves the story functionally but doesn't elevate it with a unique texture or character-specific bias in how the world is perceived.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, formal, and perfectly suited to the studious, reverent character of Elias. The point of view is held with discipline, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that enhances the story's mythic quality. Some direct explanations of his beliefs ("This was his core concept") feel slightly less integrated into the POV's immediate perception, functioning more as narrator-provided context than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The voice is the story's greatest strength: it is distinct, lyrical, and sustained with remarkable control. The prose has a specific melancholic rhythm that perfectly embodies the character's liminal state. The first-person POV remains rigorously consistent, and the character's perceptual signature—filtering the world through the lens of stories, layers, and erasure—is flawlessly maintained from the first sentence to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and clarity. The narrative voice is competent and controlled, effectively conveying the story's events. While the prose is clean, it lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes slipping into a more neutral, explanatory register ("The core concept fascinated her") that feels slightly distanced from Evelyn's immediate experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice often drifts into an analytical, abstract register that feels detached from the character's immediate experience. Phrases like "a blueprint for navigating corporate takeover" and "visual dialogue" read more like a sociologist's summary than the grounded thoughts of an individual in a crisis, creating a psychic distance that flattens the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is consistent, but the narrative voice is hampered by significant repetition of key phrases ("dawning hush," "purposefully curious," "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain"). This creates a mechanical, almost algorithmic cadence that flattens the prose and reduces the character's perceptual signature to a few recurring tags. While the tone is controlled, the lack of syntactic variety and the recycling of descriptors prevent the voice from feeling truly distinct or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is lyrical and consistent with the story's calm tone. However, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, at times feeling more like a polished, omniscient narrator than the specific internal world of this character. The sentence structures are competent but occasionally repetitive, missing opportunities for rhythmic variation that could heighten key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with precision, establishing a distinct and consistent narrative voice that perfectly suits the scholarly protagonist. The prose carries a unique perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elmsley's meticulous, pattern-seeking mind. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, modulating subtly to reflect his internal state without any unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintained with strong control, creating a mythic tone. The psychic distance is generally consistent. However, the story is marred by a single, jarring head-hop into the consciousness of Persephone, the archway's spirit. In a piece this short and tightly focused, this momentary lapse in POV discipline is a significant flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, effectively focusing the narrative on Elena's immediate experience. The voice maintains a tone appropriate to the story's speculative and wondrous nature. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes falling back on generalized descriptions ("magnificent temple," "overwhelming lonesome splendor") rather than a consistently unique perspective shaped by her scientific background and mortal peril.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story's voice is distinct and consistent, employing a lyrical, incantatory rhythm that mirrors the character's trapped, contemplative state. The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled. However, the heavy reliance on syntactic parallelism, while a deliberate stylistic choice, creates a voice that sometimes feels more like a formal poetic structure than the authentic internal texture of a character under duress, slightly compromising its immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical, maintaining a tone of mournful beauty that perfectly suits the story. POV is controlled and precise, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in the bride's spectral existence. The brief, well-managed shift to the groundskeeper in the denouement is a sophisticated choice that widens the story's lens at the close without feeling like an error.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and maintains a fairy-tale distance that suits the story's tone and concept. The point of view is stable, and the prose has a distinct, rhythmic quality that aligns with the "poetic" character. A few moments of narrative summary ("Her motivation had never been personal glory...") slightly flatten the psychic distance, but overall, the voice is controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency, and the narrative voice maintains a fittingly lyrical and reverent tone. The prose has a distinct, if sometimes formal, texture that aligns with the "cautious enchantment." The primary weakness is when the voice pulls back to offer thematic analysis, creating a slight distance from Kaelen's direct experience in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency and control, maintaining a steady psychic distance that suits the contemplative tone. Elara's perceptual signature—her focus on texture, light, and the symbolic weight of analog objects—is well-defined. The narrative voice is polished and distinct, though it occasionally drifts into a register of thematic abstraction that feels slightly less personal to the character and more like an authorial overview.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the story's fairy-tale tone. Elara's perceptual signature, focused on patterns, threads, and light, is strong. The brief dialogue is purposeful, efficiently establishing the official's condescension and reinforcing Elara's protective disguise, making every word advance character and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice establishes a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the material. The prose maintains a distinct texture throughout. However, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on familiar phrasing for the magical realism genre, and the repeated use of certain key phrases slightly dulls its distinctiveness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, and the narrative voice has a distinct, consistent texture—measured, empathetic, and reflective. The prose rhythm matches the solemn, quiet mood of the scene. The focalization stays tightly bound to what Kaelen can see, know, and infer, creating a strong perceptual signature. It avoids all major pitfalls and delivers a polished, professional voice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with professional consistency, and the lyrical, elegant voice is well-suited to the story's contemplative mood. The prose has a clear rhythm and stance. It falls just short of the highest tier because the perceptual signature, while pleasant, is not sharply individual; it reads as a generalized artistic sensibility rather than one belonging uniquely to a "vivid mural artist" of "impossible colors."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, effectively tracking Elena's perceptual shift from a meticulous restorer to a synesthetic artist. The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent tone appropriate for the story's magical-realist feel. While competent, the prose lacks a truly distinctive signature, occasionally relying on familiar lyrical constructions ("brush dancing playfully") that prevent it from reaching exceptional heights.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control and a consistent narrative distance appropriate for the world-building focus. The voice, however, is more functional than distinctive, lacking a strong perceptual signature that would distinguish Kaelen's internal experience. While the prose is competent and clear, it doesn't possess the unique texture or rhythm that would elevate it to a truly memorable narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is the story's great strength, maintaining a consistent, elevated, and lyrical tone that perfectly establishes the mythic, melancholic atmosphere. The third-person POV is controlled with a stable psychic distance appropriate for a fable. The prose has a distinct texture and perceptual signature, focused through the poet's senses on the cosmic and the internal, which remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that suits the story's elegiac tone. The prose reflects Eleth's gentle, deliberate nature. The psychic distance is well-controlled, bringing the reader close during moments of emotional weight. The voice is consistent and effective, though a few phrases feel more authorially poetic than arising organically from the character's specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is clean and functional, but its texture feels generic and somewhat detached, relying on the story's key phrases to carry emotional and thematic weight. This repetition flattens the voice, making it less character-particular than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the mystical setting. Psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Elara's internal journey. The primary weakness is the repetitive use of specific, stylized phrases ("breathing building," "dappled resolve," "encrypted compassion"), which begins to feel like a stylistic tic rather than an organic expression of the character's perception, creating a slightly artificial texture.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The introspective, lyrical voice is consistent and well-suited to the story's reflective nature, with a controlled and stable psychic distance. However, the prose occasionally strains for poetic effect, resulting in slightly overwrought phrases like "cosmic dust of her yesterdays." While the overall texture is distinct, these moments of heightened register feel less like the character's perception and more like authorial ornamentation, briefly thinning the otherwise immersive POV.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled with a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice that perfectly matches the dreamlike atmosphere. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, and Elara's perceptual signature—her focus on patterns, grain, and intuitive feelings—is strong and unique. The prose consistently reflects her internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical and observant quality that matches the protagonist’s profession and mindset. POV is tightly controlled, effectively filtering the strange beauty of the facility through Maya's expert lens. The prose has a distinct rhythm, though the repetition of certain phrases like "softly ingenious" creates a minor tic that slightly mars an otherwise strong narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly sustained, creating a tone that is both melancholic and hopeful. The point of view is tightly controlled, filtering every observation through the recollectionist's unique perceptual signature. The prose rhythm and elevated, slightly archaic diction feel authentic to a character whose existence is dedicated to preserving memory and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The analytical voice is consistent with the character's portrayal and the point of view is stable and controlled. The primary weakness is a tendency to slip into a more distant, explanatory mode that summarizes motive and success rather than fully embodying the character's perceptions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and lyrical voice that is well-suited to the story's magical realist tone. Lira’s perceptual signature, focused on tides, moonlight, and gaps, feels authentic to her character. A minor flaw is a slight drift in psychic distance, with occasional phrases that read as explanatory summary rather than immediate, in-the-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct lyrical quality. However, the narrative distance feels inconsistent, with diction that occasionally drifts into an authorial register ("noctilucent," "concentric," "luminescence") that seems outside the plausible lexicon of a harbor glazier, however reflective. This creates a slight but persistent barrier between the reader and the character's direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, and the narrative voice maintains a distinct, somber lyricism. However, the voice occasionally drifts into a register that feels more authorial than character-bound, particularly in moments of abstract psychological summary. This slight mismatch in diction creates a distance that prevents full immersion in the character's specific, personal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the elevated, contemplative voice suits the character. The prose has a distinct and controlled texture. The primary weakness lies in a few instances of expository interiority that explain the character's core conflict ("This was why he had become lucidly watchful...") rather than letting it emerge purely from his actions and perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is maintained with consistency and discipline, using a close third-person perspective that aligns well with Elara’s methodical nature. The prose is clean and controlled, establishing a professional and slightly melancholic voice. While the voice is effective and stable, it lacks a truly distinctive rhythmic signature or a perceptual bias that would elevate it from highly competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly suited to the fantastical subject matter. The point of view remains tightly controlled, and the painter's perceptual signature—attuned to light, reflection, and sound—is specific and immersive. The prose is confident and maintains its unique texture even under the pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice—weary, formal, yet resilient—is distinct and consistent with Elian's character. The psychic distance is well-controlled, moving from broader reflection into the tight focus of the negotiation. The single line of dialogue is effective, its steadiness contrasting sharply with the described "trembling in their hands."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a consistent and distinct narrative voice. The psychic distance is expertly modulated, moving seamlessly between Silas's external actions and his internal reflections without any leakage or authorial intrusion. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, reflecting his calculated yet secretly sentimental nature in what he chooses to notice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is confident and maintains a consistent, elevated, and mythic tone appropriate for the material. POV is tightly controlled, and the perceptual signature—focused on metaphysical threads and echoes—is distinct to the character. The prose creates a hypnotic, incantatory rhythm that serves the story's ritualistic nature well.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the third-person limited POV is consistent, the narrative voice is fatally undermined by programmatic repetition. Key phrases ("meteor hush," "uncommonly serene," "half-lit epiphany") are recycled verbatim, creating an artificial, non-human cadence. This stylistic tic reads as a structural artifact rather than a deliberate authorial choice, shattering the illusion of a distinct narrative voice and making the prose feel mechanical and impersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the "esoteric realist" character. The perceptual signature is strong; Aris consistently notices patterns, remnants, and textures, which aligns perfectly with their motivation. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, moving from quiet observation to the focused intensity of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the mythic tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, with phrases like "snowmelt ardor" giving Elara's interiority a unique texture. The narrative distance is perfectly calibrated to create a sense of both intimacy and epic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The point of view is controlled and maintains a consistent, fittingly introspective and slightly detached voice. The psychic distance is well-managed, shifting closer during the ritual. While the prose texture is generally strong, a few phrases like "dissolving like sugar in water" verge on cliché, and the repeated assertion of "precisely playful" feels slightly forced within the otherwise stable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, formal texture appropriate for the character and setting. The rhythm and syntax effectively reflect Anu's deliberate nature. The score is capped from a higher band due to the repetitive use of key thematic phrases, which makes the voice feel slightly mechanical and less organic by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person POV is mostly consistent but wavers slightly by revealing Elara's internal goals directly to the reader. The narrative voice is functional but lacks a distinct texture. Dialogue is the primary weakness, often serving as a vehicle for exposition and thematic statements rather than feeling like natural, character-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical, and slightly formal voice that suits the fable-like quality of the narrative. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on light, reflection, and delicate craft. The psychic distance is well-controlled, drawing the reader into the mirror maker's focused state. While effective, the dialogue reads more as philosophical declaration than speech, a stylistic choice that fits the tone but limits character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with discipline, and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's melancholic and hopeful tone. Psychic distance is well-controlled, modulating appropriately as Elara moves from grief to determined action. The voice is strong, but misses an opportunity for a truly distinct perceptual signature; the "quartz eye" is mentioned but doesn't consistently or uniquely color her way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is undermined by two significant flaws. The unexplained use of Cyrillic ("санузл") is a jarring, unmotivated intrusion that breaks immersion. Additionally, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms" reads as an awkward authorial tic rather than a natural element of the character's voice or world.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is a good fit for an "arcane linguist"—formal and intelligent. However, the psychic distance often feels too great, resulting in a narrative that describes Elara's journey rather than immersing the reader in her experience. The dialogue is functional for exposition but lacks the subtext or tension of a genuine negotiation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice. The narrative stance and psychic distance are controlled effectively, modulating with the intensity of the memories Elara experiences. The prose has a clear perceptual signature tied to Elara's unique way of experiencing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice aligns with the protagonist’s academic, methodical nature. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on telling phrases (e.g., "her warmly methodical nature guided her") instead of embodying her perspective. The single line of dialogue from Professor Croft feels generic and does little to establish his character or deepen the scene's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person POV is controlled with precision, and the lyrical, mythic voice is consistent and highly effective for the majority of the story. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature and rhythm that beautifully renders the unique setting. The slight shift to a more explanatory register in the final paragraphs is the only minor blemish.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the story's melancholic and hopeful tone. Phrasing like "thistle-blown hope" demonstrates a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythmically supports the quiet, focused nature of the protagonist's quest without any notable slips in control or consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent and fittingly melancholic tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm and a specific perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical world through Elthion's dedicated and slightly sorrowful perspective. POV control is excellent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is distinct and consistently maintained, establishing a mythic, fairy-tale tone that serves the story well. The protagonist's perceptual signature is tied effectively to his craft. The prose occasionally leans on abstractions like "collective despair," but the overall control of psychic distance and narrative stance is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to a thoughtful, observant protagonist. The POV is skillfully controlled, maintaining a close third-person perspective without leakage. The prose has a specific rhythm and texture. The primary weakness is that the internal monologue sometimes shifts from embodied perception into a more abstract, summary-like register that explains the character's cognitive process rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent psychic distance, perfectly suited to the story's introspective nature. The perceptual signature, focused on the unique "taste" of different silences, is the story's greatest strength and is flawlessly executed. The prose has a clear texture and rhythm that modulates effectively with the ascent and climax, demonstrating confident control.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a distinct, calm, and slightly elevated texture that fits the protagonist's focused mind. Psychic distance is controlled well, modulating from his specific actions to the wider effects on the passengers. The prose has a clear perceptual signature focused on sound, silence, and light.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, with a narrative voice that fits the "lore keeper" archetype. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variety, sometimes leaning on formal, descriptive language. The prose is clear and functional but does not achieve a memorable or unique texture that elevates the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is lyrical, controlled, and maintains a consistent tone that powerfully supports the story's atmosphere. The point of view is stable and effective. The score is tempered by the dialogue at the end, which feels slightly stiff and serves more to state intent ("I've come to teach you something") than to feel like natural, character-driven speech in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently without any slips. The narrative voice is functional and clear, though it occasionally strains for a literary effect with phrases like "shadowseam wonder." The prose reflects Maya's state of mind adequately but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the formal, elevated voice matches the story's tone. However, the narrative voice often over-explains the significance of events ("his stillness more powerful than any speech"), reducing subtext and reader discovery. While stable, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would separate it from a more generic "literary" narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, carrying a formal, almost mythic tone that suits the character and subject matter. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the strange environment through Galen’s focused intent. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving closer during moments of intense focus and pulling back slightly for the final resolution without any jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is well-controlled, and the narrative voice is consistent with Eleanor's quiet, methodical character. The prose has a distinct, melancholic texture. The dialogue, though sparse, is the main weakness; it tends towards direct emotional exposition, sacrificing naturalism and subtext for clarity, which slightly flattens the climactic encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, but the narrative voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature, reading as functional rather than memorable. The primary weakness is the dialogue, which is entirely expository. Theodor's lines serve only to explain the plot mechanics of the keypad, and Mara's dialogue is limited to generic commands or thematic pronouncements, missing an opportunity for character revelation through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the material. However, the repeated deployment of the specific key phrases—"quietly vivid," "vested hush"—feels mechanical and slightly artificial, as if fulfilling a checklist. This lexical insistence interrupts the voice's organic flow and hints at the authorial hand more than is ideal, preventing the piece from feeling entirely seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's tone and setting. The prose has a distinct, if familiar, fantasy texture. While technically proficient, the narrative voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would distinguish Elara's internal world from a more archetypal "wise-woman" persona, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean, consistent control. The narrative voice has a clear, fable-like quality that suits the material, though it lacks a highly distinct or memorable prose signature. While technically proficient, the voice remains a transparent window to the story rather than an active artistic element that deepens characterization or tension through its unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    Point of view is held consistently, and the voice maintains a fittingly formal, slightly melancholic tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on familiar phrasing like "ghostly sigh" and "broken promises." The narrative voice occasionally slips from reflecting Elias's internal experience to providing an omniscient thematic summary, particularly in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent lyrical voice throughout the narrative. The prose generally serves the story's aims well. However, key moments in both narration and dialogue lean into direct thematic exposition, which slightly flattens the subtext and makes the voice feel more like a vehicle for the message than a distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The point of view is consistently controlled, but the narrative voice suffers from register drift. It moves between visceral, embodied experience and a detached, clinical lexicon ("proprioceptively enhanced," "cognitive dissonance"). This creates a slightly uneven texture, as if the character is analyzing his own trauma with an academic vocabulary that feels at odds with the immediacy of his crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, mythic tone that serves the story well. The first-person POV is controlled and effective. The primary weakness is the voice's stability under pressure; it remains perfectly poetic and articulate during the climactic moment of revelation, which lacks the subtle degradation or fragmentation one might expect, making the peak feel slightly narrated rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and filtering all perception through Marcus's unique professional biases. The voice is distinct and confident, with a rhythm that reflects his methodical nature. There is a minor, almost unnoticeable register wobble where the narration becomes slightly more literary and abstract than expected for the character's internal voice, particularly in phrasing like "crisscrossed with his ability to see spirits."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and perfectly matched to the mythic quality of the narrative, establishing a distinct and immersive point of view. While the prose is controlled and effective, it maintains its elevated distance even during the climax, missing an opportunity to modulate rhythm and syntax to reflect the chaotic intensity of the "rupture."

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a distinct and consistent narrative voice that embodies Elias's "poetically inclined" nature. The prose has a specific lyrical texture, with controlled syntax and rhythm that modulate with the story's intensity. The perceptual signature is strong; the world is seen through the eyes of a poet who sees stories in shards.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, effectively establishing a lyrical, fairy-tale atmosphere. The language is elevated and controlled, fitting the "tinkersong wonder" tone. While proficient, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally feeling more like a generic storybook narrator than a deep dive into this specific character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with professional control and consistency. The narrative voice is clear and appropriate for Elara's introspective character. While the prose is highly competent, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic dynamism that would elevate it to an exceptional level; the voice is effective but not yet unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading as a neutral observer describing Elena's thoughts rather than embodying them. The prose contains authorial intrusions that explain character traits ("Elena, being perpetually learning..."). The repetition of key abstract phrases flattens the voice, making it feel more mechanical than personal, particularly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is the story's standout feature: lyrical, controlled, and perfectly matched to the main character's artistic sensibility. The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the psychic distance is expertly managed to create a tone of contemplative discovery. The prose has a distinct and memorable texture from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is maintained with technical consistency, and the narrative voice has a formal, elevated tone appropriate for an archivist. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; it often feels like an omniscient narrator reporting on Ellara's feelings rather than filtering the world through her unique consciousness. The prose is clean but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would make the voice truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the contemplative voice is consistent with the alchemist character. The narrative distance is controlled, though it occasionally slips into a more explanatory mode that summarizes Elior's thoughts rather than inhabiting them. The prose has a distinct texture, but lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and perfectly suited to the venerable character. A distinct, slightly formal prose texture is maintained throughout, modulating effectively with the rising internal tension. The point of view is controlled with no leakage, and the character's perceptual signature—focused on history, symbols, and patterns—is clear and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that is both intimate and mythic. The narrative voice has a distinct and memorable texture, marked by lyrical phrasing (“furious tranquility,” “wild serenity”) and conceptual precision. The prose rhythm and syntax perfectly match the character's focused, ritualistic state of mind, creating a seamless and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's fable-like tone. The character's perceptual signature—his focus on subtle environmental cues—is well-realized. However, the voice, while clean and effective, lacks a truly distinctive rhythmic or syntactic fingerprint that would elevate it to an exceptional level. The word choice "credulously" is slightly jarring, as its typical connotation of gullibility sits oddly with the character's proven expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the story's cosmic and philosophical scope. The point of view remains tightly controlled on Elion. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally feeling like a well-executed genre archetype, and the inclusion of "痕迹" is a stylistic flourish that momentarily breaks immersion without adding significant meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled with a consistent, formal, and lyrical voice that perfectly matches the story's contemplative tone. The narrative distance remains stable, and the recluse's perceptual signature—their "tranquil perception"—shapes every observation. The prose texture is distinct and maintained effectively, even as the emotional intensity shifts, resulting in a cohesive and immersive narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It often adopts a distant, explanatory tone ("Her motivation was simple yet profound," "the method of communication was brilliant in its simplicity") that feels more like an authorial summary than Elara's lived-in perspective. The prose is clean but lacks the specific texture and rhythm that would fully embody the main character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; its eloquent observations feel more authorial than character-specific. While the prose is beautiful, the narrative voice is so polished and omniscient about its own feelings that it creates distance, failing to fully inhabit the specific, flawed mind of an individual in the process of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and effective for the vast majority of the story, creating a strong sense of intimacy with Elias. However, the final paragraph contains a significant POV break: "And somewhere beyond the veil of death, Elias smiled." This shift to a posthumous, omniscient viewpoint undermines the established perspective at a critical moment, disrupting the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, academic tone appropriate for the character. However, the voice's distinctiveness is hampered by a reliance on recurring labels ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious"). This repetition creates a slightly mechanical feel, preventing the prose from achieving a truly unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice has a fittingly formal, mythic quality. The prose is controlled, and the psychic distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its somber, reflective tone. The prose has a clear rhythm and texture. The primary weakness lies in a slight reliance on abstract labels like "intuitively descriptive vision" and "tinted revelations," which feel more like authorial explanations for Silas's ability rather than a distinct perceptual signature emerging organically from his perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading as a more objective, authorial summary of Elara's feelings. The prose is eloquent but relies on an elevated, abstract register that feels disconnected from a grounded, personal experience of the character's unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with technical competence, and the narrative voice is consistent. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading like a generic fantasy protagonist. The dialogue is a key weakness, functioning almost entirely as exposition rather than as action or character revelation, particularly in the master's final speech.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct narrative voice. The prose has a unique poetic and slightly formal texture that feels specific to Elara's character as a self-appointed historian. Her perceptual signature is clear, focusing on sound, shadow, and the weight of absence, creating a coherent and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is confident and consistent, establishing a fittingly mythic and contemplative tone. The close third-person POV is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Maven's perceptions and internal shifts.

The narrative stance effectively modulates from uncertainty to dawning power, reflecting the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the formal, slightly elevated voice is appropriate for the character. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes drifting into a more detached, summary-like narration. A line like "a test that had defeated many before him" feels like an authorial intrusion, momentarily breaking from the character's direct knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and well-suited to the mythic tone of the story. POV is stable within Elara’s perspective. The prose has a distinct poetic texture. However, the psychic distance occasionally pulls back too far, shifting from Elara’s immediate experience to a more abstract, authorial explanation of the story's concepts, which slightly flattens the voice's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the fantastical, melancholic atmosphere. The close third-person POV maintains a stable psychic distance, modulating effectively as Marcel delves deeper into his memories. The prose has a distinct, slightly archaic rhythm that enhances the sense of a timeless, isolated existence, and the character's perceptual signature is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill, creating a voice that is both lyrical and authentic to the nostalgic character. The perceptual signature is strong; Elias consistently views his world through an artist's eye. Psychic distance is modulated effectively, drawing the reader close during the emotional climax in the cave without ever breaking the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent. The brief, clean switch to the sister's perspective is a bold but effective choice that validates the story's central premise without feeling like an authorial intrusion. The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent tone, though it lacks a truly unique or surprising perceptual signature that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control. The narrative voice is consistent in its somber, focused tone, effectively conveying the navigator's solitary existence. The primary weakness is a slight drift in register during moments of thematic summary, where the voice becomes more authorial and abstract rather than staying grounded in the character's specific, sensory perception. Otherwise, the prose is controlled and the psychic distance is well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent with Elara’s methodical, isolated character, using precise language ("meticulously scanned," "tantamount"). The point of view is stable and effective. The voice loses some of its specificity in the final paragraphs, shifting from Elara’s immediate perceptual experience to a more generalized, expository summary of the theme, which slightly distances the reader at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that aligns with Elias's reserved, observant nature. The narrative voice has a distinct, slightly formal and literary texture that feels authentic to the character and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is maintained with consistency and control, using a close third-person perspective that suits the introspective nature of the protagonist. The voice is clean and purposeful, modulating appropriately for the quiet, lonely tone. While the prose is skilled, the narrative voice itself lacks a highly distinctive or memorable perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the story's aims. The narrative voice has a distinct, elevated fantasy register that is sustained throughout. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the overall execution of the viewpoint is professional and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The POV is stable and the voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent "scientifically romantic" perceptual filter. The narrative maintains a controlled psychic distance that suits the contemplative tone. The prose texture is unique, though at times it verges on being overly mannered with abstract coinages that feel more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a tight, consistent psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elias's fractured perception. The narrative voice is distinct, with a lyrical and contemplative rhythm that perfectly matches the story's tone and themes. The prose has a clear perceptual signature; we see this strange world entirely through the filter of Elias's unique, time-tossed consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is well-controlled, and the narrative voice has a consistent, gentle texture. However, the dialogue lacks naturalism and distinction; both characters speak in a similar, slightly formal register that primarily serves to articulate the theme. This convergence of voice weakens the scene's realism.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice is distinct, confident, and suited to a scholar. The prose modulates effectively with Elara's internal state, shifting from precise, academic description to short, sharp perceptions during moments of panic. The psychic distance is expertly managed, bringing the reader close to Elara's struggle without ever breaking from her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, literary narrative voice. The primary weakness lies in the dialogue, which suffers from voice convergence; both characters speak in the same aphoristic, slightly overwrought style as the narration. This stylistic consistency comes at the cost of character distinction and naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The elevated, formal voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the cosmic scale of the story. The point of view remains stable, and the perceptual signature is clear. The score is limited by a degree of syntactic monotony; many sentences follow a similar "The [noun] [verb/was]..." structure, creating a slightly repetitive rhythm that flattens the prose's texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is controlled and the voice is consistent, maintaining a contemplative, slightly formal tone that suits the character and setting. The prose has a distinct rhythm that supports the story’s philosophical mood. However, the reliance on certain key phrases like "eminently peculiar" feels like a narrative tic that slightly flattens the voice's texture through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, but it lacks a distinctive perceptual signature. The prose is clean and controlled but feels somewhat generic, with a slightly detached, elevated register that sometimes distances the reader from Elara's immediate sensory experience. It functions effectively but doesn't have the unique texture that would mark a truly exceptional voice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is superb: precise, melancholic, and intellectually rigorous, perfectly suited to the POV character. Elena's perceptual signature, filtering the world through probability and pattern, is maintained consistently. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture that elevates the story's philosophical weight without ever feeling cumbersome or unnatural.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct, melancholic voice that perfectly suits the character and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, creating a distinct and melancholic narrative voice. Psychic distance is managed well, modulating between sensory detail and internal reflection. The prose has a specific texture, though occasional phrases like "through proximate causes" feel slightly too academic and create a minor register shift away from the more lyrical and personal voice established elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that allows access to Archie's inner turmoil while preserving his elusive nature.

The prose effectively reflects his internal state without any slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the focalization through touch creates a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and clarity throughout the narrative. The voice is tonally consistent, aligning with Elara's reflective and professional nature. While technically proficient, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic idiosyncrasy that would elevate it from competent to memorable; it explains Elara’s world effectively but doesn't feel uniquely filtered through her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person POV maintains a consistent, lyrical distance appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative voice has a distinct, poetic texture. However, it occasionally slips into abstract declarations ("a man existing in that peculiar timeframe when no one remembers you") that summarize his condition rather than filtering the world through a unique perceptual signature grounded in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is one of distant summary rather than immediate experience, keeping the reader at arm's length. The repeated phrase "volcanic tenderness" is a strong initial piece of voice, but its recurrence becomes a heavy-handed authorial intrusion rather than an organic character thought. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature rooted in the character's immediate sensory world.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that is both intimate and lyrical.

    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that aligns with Marlo's reserved and observant character. The narrative voice has a distinct, precise texture, reflecting the protagonist's meticulous nature. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Marlo's final lines to Vance carrying significant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and consistent in its tone and rhythm, creating a powerful mood. However, the point of view occasionally breaks to deliver omniscient thematic exposition ("This was their ancient duty..."), pulling the reader out of the scene's immediacy. These moments read more like authorial commentary than a character's filtered perception, slightly compromising the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits Arthur's gentle, observant character. The voice is distinct and lyrical without becoming overwrought, creating a coherent perceptual signature. The prose rhythm effectively modulates between quiet reflection in the grotto and the hushed urgency of the planning.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lyrical third-person limited POV is maintained with impressive control, creating a voice that feels both intimate and mythic. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic grace, exemplified by phrases like "the combative tenderness of yearning." Psychic distance is managed well, drawing the reader into Mara's inner state without ever breaking the narrative's elegant surface.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person POV is stable, but the narrative voice occasionally slips into an authorial register that breaks psychic distance. Stating the character's motivation as "clear in his journal" or explicitly defining his moral space are intrusions that tell the reader what to think. While his spoken theatrical voice is distinct, the narrative voice itself lacks a consistent, character-bound perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with stability and consistency. The voice maintains a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the subject matter, and the poet's perceptual signature is fittingly focused on light, shadow, and vibration. The voice, however, occasionally slips into generic phrasing for emotional moments and lacks a distinctive syntactic rhythm, creating a slightly monotonous cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent for most of the story, maintaining a close third-person perspective on Elara. However, the point of view fractures in the final two paragraphs. The line "No one noticed when Elara's color perception returned" is a jarring shift to an external, omniscient narrator. This is followed by a final paragraph of authorial philosophizing, which fully abandons Elara's immediate, embodied experience at the story's most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, establishing a distinct lyrical and contemplative mood. However, the voice lacks a truly particular perceptual signature, feeling more like a high-concept narrator than the specific mind of the character. The repeated use of identical key phrases ("artificial pilgrimage," "texture of connection") creates a sense of mechanical construction rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control, establishing a consistent psychic distance. The voice is lyrical and distinctive, matching the "subdued ardor" of the protagonist with a consistent perceptual signature focused on light, craft, and cosmology.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, fittingly erudite voice for Elias. The narrative prose has a distinct and compelling rhythm. The dialogue, while functional in advancing the plot, lacks the same texture and naturalism, reading as slightly stiff and expository ("I understand you're doing something extraordinary with these cards").

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Point of view is controlled and the lyrical voice is consistent and well-suited to the material. Psychic distance is managed effectively, drawing the reader into Elara's trance-like state. The narrative voice, while elegant, lacks a highly idiosyncratic perceptual signature, occasionally reading as more of a generic "literary" style rather than a unique character's filter on the world.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, speculative tone of the story. POV is controlled, staying tightly with Elara, and her perceptual signature as a "dusk noticer" shapes what details are given focus. The prose effectively conveys her internal state through a quiet, observant narrative stance that modulates well during the moment of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice is controlled, maintaining a tone appropriate for the character. Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual signature is focused on the natural world. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive texture, occasionally slipping into generic lyrical prose that feels safe rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a generic, mystical register. Interiority frequently explains the character's state rather than embodying it ("Elara understood now..."). While the prose is clean, it doesn't modulate effectively under pressure, maintaining a uniform tone of calm revelation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyrical voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, dreamlike tone. The POV is tightly controlled. However, the prose is hampered by a lack of rhythmic variety and a reliance on elevated, abstract phrasing that creates a sense of narrative distance. This consistent register prevents the voice from modulating effectively with the rising internal pressure, keeping it at a single, somewhat monotonous pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical, third-person limited voice is consistent in its tone and maintains a close psychic distance to Elara, effectively conveying her unique perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating with the story's emotional arc. However, the voice occasionally verges on a generic "literary" style, using familiar celestial and ethereal descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct narrative voice that is both lyrical and weary. The prose has a specific perceptual signature, filtering this surreal world through the guard’s unique consciousness. Psychic distance is managed well, drawing the reader into the guard's internal landscape without ever breaking from the established melancholic, observant tone.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a suitably philosophical and inquisitive tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to a slightly generic, formal register that describes events with more abstraction than specificity. While technically clean, the prose lacks the unique texture that would make the voice memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and perfectly matched to the fable-like quality of the narrative. The collective POV is handled cleanly, focusing through Maris without any jarring shifts or head-hopping. The prose has a distinct, solemn rhythm. The only minor weakness is that the voice is so uniformly poetic that it occasionally lacks a specific, grounded perceptual signature, reading more as a timeless narrator than an individual's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and touch. The voice is lyrical and melancholic, perfectly matching the story's tone. The prose rhythm modulates well, from the "soft, measured steps" at the beginning to the rising hum of the climax. There are no slips in focalization or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is appropriately contemplative and scientific for the character. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping us tightly within Marina's perceptions. While the prose is clean and effective, it lacks a truly distinctive rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would elevate it to an exceptional level; the voice is more functional than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The limited third-person POV is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical voice that suits the "stargazer" protagonist. Psychic distance is managed well, shifting closer as she approaches the circle and her emotional intensity rises. The narrative demonstrates a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on cosmic connection, tactile sensations, and the interplay of light and shadow, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control, creating a consistent and appropriate narrative voice for Maya.

Psychic distance is stable, and the focalization effectively channels the world through Maya's perceptions and priorities without any unmotivated shifts or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, quiet distance appropriate for the character. The voice has a distinct poetic texture, but it's occasionally disrupted by shifts into a more clinical register ("method of coping," "somatic markers"). This slight inconsistency in diction prevents the voice from being perfectly seamless, though it remains effective overall.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a cohesive, melancholic tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, particularly in its focus on light and shadow. However, the repeated rhetorical questions function more as authorial signposts than organic interiority, and some phrases ("luminescent ache," "fragmented reality") are recycled, slightly dulling the voice's specificity by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the tracker's methodical and obsessive nature. Psychic distance is well-controlled, shifting appropriately during the climax. While the prose is clean and effective, the voice lacks a truly distinctive rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would elevate it to the highest tier of literary quality; it is highly competent but not unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, but the narrative voice is significantly weakened by mechanical repetition. Phrases like "echoing library under snow" and "contraband truths" are recycled to the point of feeling like artifacts of a writing prompt. This damages the prose's natural rhythm and makes the voice feel less like a unique perspective and more like a constructed assembly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reflective tone appropriate for the character's contemplative state. The third-person POV is controlled and stable. The prose has a distinct, quiet texture. The main weakness is a tendency toward an explanatory narrative stance, where concepts like "engraved quiet" and key character traits are described to the reader rather than being fully embodied in the prose and perception, creating a sense of psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is masterful—a consistent, lyrical, and mythic tone perfectly suited to the material. The third-person limited POV is controlled, maintaining a psychic distance that enhances the story's legendary quality without feeling detached. The narrative stance is confident, and the prose has a distinct, elevated rhythm that carries the reader through its abstract concepts without faltering. The perceptual signature is unique, focused on vibrations, patterns, and feelings.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice feels generic and burdened by repetition. Key phrases like "rosewood pen nib," "echoing observatory," and "orbits of regret" are recycled to the point of becoming prose tics rather than meaningful motifs. This mechanical repetition flattens the voice, making it feel less like a distinct character's perception and more like an algorithm assembling pre-approved components.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, creating a melancholic and intimate voice that aligns perfectly with the story's tone. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm. A minor flaw appears in the line "Elias signed—the lab's AI was programmed to read his hands," which reads as a slightly clunky piece of exposition that momentarily breaks the narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance appropriate for the reflective, observant protagonist. The voice is lyrical and distinct, with a perceptual signature that rightly focuses on patterns, sounds, and sensations. The absence of dialogue is a strong choice that reinforces the story's theme of non-verbal communication.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice. However, the narrative is weakened by a register mismatch; phrases like "retrocognitively trapped" and "aberrant mercy" feel like academic labels imposed on the character. This creates a psychic distance, making the voice feel more authorial and less grounded in the character's immediate, visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is lyrical and distinct. The protagonist’s synesthesia provides a unique and memorable perceptual signature that shapes the prose. While generally strong, the voice sometimes defaults to slightly more conventional phrasing that doesn't fully match the originality of the core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, but the narrative voice is hampered by repetition. The overuse of specific key phrases ("fractally precise," "illuminate hidden pathways") creates a somewhat mechanical rhythm that flattens the voice's texture. While the clinical tone fits Maya's scientific side, the prose doesn't consistently reflect the "affectionate" aspect of her character in its structure, relying instead on the label.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is functional rather than distinctive. The prose is clean but lacks a unique perceptual signature that would elevate the character's experience. An authorial intrusion like "a truly factually mystical phenomenon" breaks the voice's established tone and feels like an external label rather than Maya's internal thought.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The voice is lyrical and fits the fable-like quality of the story. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a detached, wise narrator than a specific character's internal experience. Repetitive sentence constructions ("As she...," "As the truth...") create a slightly mechanical rhythm in places.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill. The narrative voice possesses a distinct, consistent texture—melancholic, precise, and formal—that perfectly matches the character's background and internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical voice that perfectly matches the story's mystical, melancholic tone. The coachman's perceptual signature—his focus on natural rhythms—is distinct and well-maintained. A minor flaw appears in a few phrases ("The complexity of life distilled itself into essence...") that slip from the character's immediate sensory experience into a more abstract, omniscient register, slightly blurring the otherwise clean focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and maintains a consistent lyrical tone appropriate for the character and subject matter. POV is handled with clean, third-person limited perspective, and the psychic distance is stable. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering the magical events through Kael's specific, potter-like sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice has a distinct lyrical quality. However, the dialogue is stilted and functions more as a vehicle for fable-like pronouncements than natural speech. Lines like "The garden needs light in dark seasons" feel overly portentous and break the otherwise grounded tone. The prose also occasionally slips into an overly articulate, analytical register ("crystallized," "protected vulnerability") that distances the reader from Mara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and perfectly matched to the story's mythic, contemplative tone. The third-person limited POV maintains a controlled psychic distance, allowing for deep interiority without leakage. Elena's perceptual signature is distinct, focused on cosmic rhythms and flows of knowledge, which makes the world feel both grand and intimately experienced. The prose has a clear rhythm that modulates effectively with her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice feels generic and is severely damaged by repetitive phrasing. The constant recycling of key terms ("inevitably whimsical," "keeper of secrets") creates a mechanical rhythm that distances the reader from the character's perception. This programmatic quality makes the voice feel less like a unique individual's internal experience and more like a narrator fulfilling a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent. The tone is competent and clear, fitting the analytical mind of the protagonist. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic dynamism, often opting for efficient explanation over a more textured, sensory experience of the events as they unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, but the narrative voice lacks a distinctive signature. While competent, the prose relies on standard fantasy register and conceptual labels ("spatial mutiny," "cosmic possibility") that feel more like an omniscient summary than the specific perceptual filter of a character under duress. The voice is clear and functional but doesn't achieve a unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly and effectively, and the narrative voice is competent and clear. Dialogue is functional, serving to advance the plot by delivering necessary information. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic texture beyond what is required for the procedural plot, remaining professional but not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is stable and effectively limited to Eli, maintaining narrative control. The voice is clear and professional, fitting the scientific context, but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or memorable rhythm. Dialogue is functional for exposition but does not carry significant subtext. The overall execution is competent and clean, but without the flair or specificity needed for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical voice with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythm. The POV is controlled and stable within Elias's perspective. The prose texture is strong, though a few phrases like "dynamically observant" feel like a slight register drift from the otherwise mythic, folksy tone. Overall, the voice is a significant strength, creating the necessary atmosphere of "luminous disbelief."

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Elias's reflective nature. The primary flaw is a distinct prose tic: the verbatim repetition of key phrases like "perceptively calm" and "dusky harmony." This creates a mechanical rhythm and makes the voice feel constructed around keywords rather than flowing organically from the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and consistency. The voice, however, is somewhat generic for the genre, relying on a soft, elevated tone ("understanding's dawn," "midnight solace") that lacks a distinctive perceptual signature. While clean, the narrative voice does not possess the unique texture or rhythm that would mark it as exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently. The narrative voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying heavily on a handful of recurring phrases ("warlike serenity," "swirling orchard vortex"). This repetition makes the voice feel constructed and less organic, a container for the plot rather than a unique lens through which to experience it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone, fitting the fantastical subject matter. The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice occasionally slips into abstract, authorial summary of emotions ("anxious elation") rather than maintaining a specific, character-bound perceptual signature throughout the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the mythic tone, establishing a distinct perceptual signature for Elara. POV is stable and psychic distance is expertly controlled, modulating effectively during the ritual climax. While the voice is strong, a few phrases like "dusky resolve" feel slightly familiar within the genre, holding it just back from true exceptionalism.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that is both intimate and observational. The voice has a distinct texture—weary, precise, melancholic—that perfectly suits the character and story. Dialogue is sparse but effective, highlighting the gap between external and internal valuation and advancing the scene's purpose cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    The voice is the story's greatest strength: scholarly, precise, and imbued with a quiet sense of wonder that perfectly matches the protagonist's character. The POV is flawlessly controlled, and the perceptual signature is distinct—Elara consistently interprets the world through her expertise in ancient languages and history. The syntax and diction create a consistent, elegant texture that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and perfectly calibrated to the story's mythic, serene tone. The third-person POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, and the prose has a specific texture and rhythm that creates a powerful sense of timelessness. The perceptual signature feels unique to this character and their strange world.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently with good control over psychic distance. The voice is functional and establishes a fable-like tone appropriate for the material. However, it lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes slipping into a more generic, writerly register that describes concepts ("monuments to humanity's expectation of ending") rather than embodying the inspector's specific, professional viewpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and a consistent, lyrical tone. The narrative voice aligns with Elena's methodical-yet-sensitive nature. The score is significantly impacted by a jarring textual artifact: the inclusion of "市政府" breaks voice, setting, and plausibility, reading as an uncorrected error. Without this flaw, the score would be substantially higher.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is consistent and the narrative voice maintains a stable, slightly elevated fairy-tale register appropriate for the material. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; the way the dreamer notices the world feels more generic than character-particular. While competent and free of technical errors like head-hopping, the prose doesn't achieve a unique rhythmic or syntactic character that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that modulates effectively under pressure. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara’s specific sensitivities and professional lens. The point of view is controlled with no leakage, creating a deeply immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent, lyrical voice that perfectly matches the story's solemn and magical tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's focused, reverent perspective. The narrative distance remains stable, drawing the reader close while preserving the sense of a sacred, private ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone. The prose has a distinct, if sometimes formal, texture that suits the contemplative mood. However, the voice occasionally flattens into telling the theme directly, which feels more authorial than character-driven. While the POV is technically sound, its proximity to overt thematic statement slightly weakens its immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice often describes Elian's state with an objective, diagnostic quality rather than embodying it. Phrases like "protected vulnerability" feel like an external assessment, creating a psychic distance that works against the intended interiority. The voice describes his detachment rather than performing it through prose.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, if somewhat generic, mystical voice. The dialogue is functional, serving entirely to advance the lesson. The primary weakness is a slight wobble into an omniscient-sounding narrator to explain the theme, which briefly disrupts the established psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable, and the elevated, mythic voice is consistently maintained, lending the story an appropriate sense of gravitas. The prose has a distinct rhythm fitting the stately pace of Kael's quest. The voice, while effective, occasionally leans on familiar fantasy phrasing ("weathered resolve etched into his determined brow"), which keeps it from feeling exceptionally unique, but it serves the story's aims well.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and consistency. The narrative voice is controlled and fits the story's reflective, slightly formal tone. While the prose is clean and effective, it lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier; the voice is more functional than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, fitting tone, but the dialogue is a significant weakness. The librarian speaks in essays, delivering exposition and theme in a manner that lacks naturalism or subtext. While Hemingway's side of the conversation is brief and functional, the librarian's lines read as authorial intrusion, flattening a key scene into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a suitably formal, cosmic tone. However, the voice feels somewhat mechanical due to the heavy repetition of key phrases ("quiet enthusiasm," "stellar doubt," "backwards prophecy"). This patterned diction, while perhaps aiming for a ritualistic feel, ultimately flattens the character's internal experience into a series of recurring labels, reducing the voice's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is masterful—lyrical, consistent, and perfectly suited to an ancient, sorrowful being. The third-person limited POV maintains a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on elements of memory, light, and sorrow that feel authentic to the character. The prose has a unique rhythm and texture that elevates the narrative from a simple plot to a piece of mythic fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control and consistency. The narrative voice is lyrical and fits the fantasy tone, though it lacks a highly distinct or character-particular signature. The prose is confident, but the voice sometimes slips into a more analytical, summary-like register that distances the reader from the mage's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control. The narrative voice is consistent and fits the contemplative tone of the character and story. While the prose is clear and competent, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic dynamism that would elevate it to a higher tier; it serves the story effectively but does not, in itself, feel remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's elevated, mystical tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm and the perceptual signature is clear, focusing on color, light, and pattern in a way that aligns with the character's alchemical work. While effective, the voice occasionally relies on familiar fantasy phrasing, just shy of feeling truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a formal, controlled voice appropriate for the character's role. However, the voice is significantly marred by a reliance on repetitive sentence structures and the recycling of entire phrases ("After the radio static cleared," "Remembering through muscle memory"). This template cadence creates a stilted rhythm that feels more like a structural constraint than an organic narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose often adopts a formal, slightly academic register ("fundamental dualities that underpinned reality") that feels detached from the character's immediate, high-stakes emotional and physical experience, creating a distance between the voice and the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a specific lyrical tone, but it feels highly artificial and constructed. The pervasive repetition of key phrases ("hush of possibility," "storm-born silence") creates a hypnotic but ultimately monotonous effect. The voice lacks a unique perceptual signature, reading more like a vehicle for the theme than the authentic internal world of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a close psychic distance that immerses the reader in Silas’s sorrowful, obsessive state. The voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct prose rhythm that mirrors the mournful, chugging thrum of the blower. This creates a cohesive and immersive perceptual signature without a single slip.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, elevated tone that suits the ancient, non-human protagonist. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close enough to understand the internal stakes while preserving the character's otherness. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic quality, though some sentences become heavy with chained clauses and abstract nouns, slightly impeding momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is stable and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for the genre. The narrative distance is well-controlled, modulating effectively between external action and internal reflection. Elias's perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on the mystical energies and the melancholy beauty of his surroundings, creating a cohesive and immersive narrative world.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, speculative tone. However, the narrative voice occasionally slips into an authorial register that feels detached from Elara’s immediate experience. A line like "The practical approach to this fantasy was simple" summarizes the method from an external perspective rather than filtering the thought through the character's specific perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, slightly elevated and formal tone that fits the magical realist concept. The voice effectively conveys Liam's inner state of determined calm. The dialogue is brief and functional, serving mainly to advance the plot mechanics at key junctures, but it maintains the established tone without disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent with the character's intellectual and artistic nature. The prose has a distinct, elevated texture. The reliance on abstract compound nouns ("fever dream architect," "rational enchantment") as a primary feature of the voice, however, sometimes keeps the reader at a conceptual distance rather than immersing them in a specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is disciplined and the authorial voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of intellectual contemplation that suits the protagonist. The prose is clean and controlled. The dialogue, however, functions more as formal speech-making and exposition rather than naturalistic interaction, particularly in the final address to the students.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, with no leaks or unmotivated shifts in psychic distance. The narrative voice, however, lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on slightly generic phrasing ("reeling hush" is used twice). The dialogue is functional in advancing the plot but doesn't carry significant subtext or unique character rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a stable voice that matches the solemn, focused tone of the narrative. Elara’s perceptual signature—her ability to sense the invisible—is well-established and consistently filters her experience of the world. While highly competent and professional, the prose lacks a final, unique spark that would make the voice truly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone of quiet contemplation appropriate for a "digital ghost." The point of view is controlled, and the character's perceptual signature—the constant counting of heartbeats and the focus on chaotic patterns—is unique and skillfully integrated into both narration and action. There are no notable slips in psychic distance or control.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is masterful, establishing and sustaining a lyrical, mythic tone that is perfectly calibrated to the subject matter. The point of view is controlled, and the prose carries a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical world through the storyteller’s quiet, obsessive focus with unwavering consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, with a consistent narrative voice that feels authentic to a seasoned, thoughtful researcher. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the wondrous environment through Aris's evolving scientific and personal lens. Psychic distance is controlled with precision, modulating effectively between observation and internal reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the fairy-tale quality of the narrative. The prose carries a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature. The narrative occasionally pulls back into a more summative, slightly distant mode, telling us of Elayn's purpose or the orchard's nature, which momentarily lessens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    The limited third-person POV is controlled and effective for most of the story, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elias's experience. The voice is distinct and literary. A notable weakness appears in the final paragraphs, where the narration pulls back into a more summary-based, omniscient-adjacent voice ("That night, he would mark...", "Elias had become..."), which slightly breaks the established POV frame at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that is perfectly suited to the fairy-tale tone of the narrative. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through a lens of quiet wonder and persistent observation. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader close to the carpenter's sensory experience without ever breaking character or becoming overly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent and distinctive voice that blends methodical observation with a sense of wonder. The narrative lexicon ("analog memories," "mathematical possibility") feels specific to this character and world. The psychic distance is perfectly calibrated to create a tone of "observed solitude," drawing the reader into Margaret's intimate, secret world.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent lyrical and melancholic voice that suits the story's tone. Narrative distance is stable, and the prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature ("luminous absence"). The voice effectively carries the story's emotional and magical weight without any slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lofty, lyrical voice appropriate for the fantastical premise. The prose has a distinct, stately rhythm and a specific perceptual signature focused on liminal, magical details. The voice is effective and stable but lacks significant modulation under pressure; its serene, knowing tone remains largely unchanged even during the climactic psychic intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the voice is consistent with the protagonist's scholarly yet determined nature. The narrative distance modulates effectively from detached observation to intimate reclamation, maintaining a coherent and fitting tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct narrative voice for the archivist. His perceptual signature is clear in how he notices the shadow peripherally. Dialogue is sparse but effective, delineating the master/apprentice dynamic. The prose has a specific, slightly formal rhythm that perfectly suits the character and the dusty, silent setting.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone and maintains a stable psychic distance. The prose signature is clear, fitting the fairy-tale quality of the piece. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive, idiosyncratic texture, occasionally relying on familiar archetypal phrasing for a "wise elder" figure, which keeps it from achieving exceptional status.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the magical-realist tone.

The psychic distance is stable, bringing the reader close to Elena's internal experience without ever breaking frame. The voice feels singular and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is clean and controlled but feels more like a summary of a character's thoughts than a direct immersion into her unique worldview. The tone is stately and descriptive, but it doesn't modulate significantly even at the moment of discovery, keeping the reader at an emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, with a consistent psychic distance and a voice that perfectly captures Elara's analytic yet sensitive nature. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature. A minor slip occurs with the line "The melancholy that washed over her was sophisticated," which reads more as authorial description than the character's immediate, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, lyrical distance appropriate for the fairy-tale tone. The narrative voice has a distinct texture, using phrases like "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" to build its world effectively. While the focalization is clean, the voice occasionally defaults to summary where a more immediate, perceptual filtering of events would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and consistency, creating a focused, contemplative voice for Elira. The psychic distance is well-controlled throughout the ascent, drawing the reader into her process of discovery. The primary weakness is a slight flattening of the voice in the concluding paragraphs, which shifts from Elira's specific perspective to a more generalized, authorial summary of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the character—thoughtful, scientific, yet with a poetic sensibility. The point of view is controlled with no leakage, and the psychic distance feels appropriate for the reflective nature of the piece. The main weakness is a slight lack of modulation; the tone remains quite cerebral and composed even as her physical situation remains precarious, missing an opportunity for her internal voice to fracture or sharpen under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and filtering the world through Elara's unique perceptual signature. The narrative voice is confident and fittingly lyrical. The focus on patterns, light, and gesture over facial features establishes a memorable and authentic perspective that is inseparable from the story's core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and clarity. The narrative voice is functional and appropriate for the story's tone of quiet wonder, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature or memorable rhythm. The prose reads as competent and clean but somewhat generic, failing to establish a voice that feels unique to this specific character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The POV is stable and the elevated, mythic voice is largely consistent with the story's aims. However, the prose's texture is weakened by the mechanical repetition of key phrases ("hauntingly bright," "under the soft hush"), which disrupts the organic flow and feels more like an authorial directive than a natural part of the narrative voice. This recurrence creates a slightly artificial, templated feel in an otherwise controlled piece.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is that of a detached, omniscient storyteller, fitting for a fable but lacking the specific perceptual signature required for compelling literary fiction. The psychic distance is vast and consistent, but it prevents any sense of immediacy or intimacy with the characters' experiences. It's a functional but generic narrative stance that prioritizes summary over immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and maintains a consistent poetic register that perfectly suits the mythic material. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, creating a sense of solemnity and grandeur. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency to state a key concept or description, like "beautifully flawed" or "pane of hush," with the exact same phrasing upon repetition, which very slightly undermines the otherwise organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and clarity. The narrative voice establishes a fitting fairy-tale tone, with moments of strong phrasing like "graceless beauty." However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, and the sentence structure, particularly in the first half, tends toward a repetitive "Subject-Verb" cadence that feels more like a report than a unique narrative style.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice has a distinct, intellectual texture that suits the character. However, the dialogue feels somewhat stilted and serves the theme too neatly. The sister's line, "We all choose our paths... but that doesn't mean they can't intersect again," reads more like a thematic statement for the reader than a natural response, flattening the moment's emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the fantastical, melancholic atmosphere. The psychic distance is well-controlled, shifting appropriately between observation of the magical setting and the vendor's internal reflections. The prose texture creates a strong, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and effectively filtered through Kael's unique perceptual gift, which is a significant strength. However, the narrative voice itself is somewhat generic and formal, lacking a truly distinct rhythm or syntax. The presence of filter verbs ("knowing," "felt") and stock phrases slightly distances the reader from the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical, and earnest tone, establishing a clear mood. However, it feels more authorial than character-driven, holding the protagonist at a distance. The complete absence of on-page dialogue, opting instead for summary ("Farmers spoke... townspeople shared..."), is a major stylistic choice that reinforces the story's fable-like quality but sacrifices immediacy and character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistent, establishing a specific, elevated tone. However, the voice's distinctiveness comes from the constant repetition of the story's key jargon ("helix-minded," "synaptic plasticity," "quaking reverie"). This creates a stylistic signature but also makes the voice feel constructed and less like a natural internal monologue, blurring the line between character thought and authorial theme-building.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained. The narrative voice is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of unique phrases like "prism-minded," "clandestinely luminous," and "latent blaze." This stylistic tic overwhelms any subtler character voice, creating a generic, almost algorithmic texture that lacks a specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's contemplative tone. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, modulating slightly as Elara connects with the sculpture's emotions. Elara's perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through the lens of potential sound and resonance, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the formal, contemplative voice is well-suited to the character of a chess tutor. The narrative distance is controlled effectively, modulating slightly as the climax approaches. However, the prose is hampered by repetitive syntactic patterns that flatten the voice's texture, preventing it from achieving a more distinct and memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control. The voice has a distinct, consistent texture—contemplative, precise, and slightly formal—which aligns perfectly with the character's "theatrical sincerity." The prose has a specific perceptual signature, filtering the world through the lens of vibrations and frequencies, creating a memorable and coherent narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is consistent and the narrative voice is lyrical and controlled, fitting the story's gentle, mystical tone. Phrases like "at the turning of the tide's thought" and "wildflower hush" create a distinct texture. The main drawback is that this poetic register can sometimes feel more authorial than character-bound, creating a slight distance from Elara's immediate, embodied experience. The voice is beautiful but lacks a certain gritty, character-specific particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is clear, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Arion's perspective is generic and functional, serving the plot without revealing a unique way of seeing the world. The prose is competent but does not have the specific rhythm or texture that would elevate it to a memorable and character-particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice feels artificial and mechanical. It is saturated with prompt-like phrases ("singular convergence," "rapidly adapting," "hazy precision") that are repeated without variation, making Elena's internal monologue sound less like a distinct character and more like a recitation of the story's key terms. This repetition disrupts the potential for a unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and well-suited to the lyrical, elevated tone of the story.

The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture that successfully establishes the intended otherworldly mood.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, slightly formal tone appropriate for the genre. The narrative voice is controlled and professional, effectively filtering the world through Eldrin's perspective. However, it lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature or rhythmic variety that would elevate it from highly competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and stable, and the narrative voice—cool, analytical, and precise—is a perfect match for Elara’s character. Her perceptual signature consistently filters the world through her scientific goal. While effective, the voice occasionally verges on a familiar "detached scientist" archetype without adding a truly unique lexical flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly and effectively. The narrative voice is consistent with the story's fairy-tale tone, though it occasionally lacks a distinct, character-particular texture, favoring a more mythic, slightly generic prose style. The repeated phrase "across the fade from memory to myth" feels like an imposed framing device rather than an organic part of the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on formal, descriptive statements. The most significant issue is the repetition of key phrases ("attentive mystic," "firmly grounded," "quartz arbor in mist"), which makes the voice feel mechanical and constructed, undercutting its authority and texture. This syntactic recycling prevents the voice from feeling unique to Elara's specific mindset under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that is well-suited to the fable-like material.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a steady, fable-like tone. However, the psychic distance remains large throughout, preventing deep immersion in Orion's perspective, even during his critical choice. The narrative voice is clean and functional for a legend, but it lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature that would elevate it from competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into a slightly detached, conceptual register ("pushing the boundaries of human consciousness itself," "the architecture of existence"). This creates a small amount of psychic distance, making the character feel more like an observer of their own experience rather than being fully immersed in it, particularly during moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the contemplative protagonist and setting. The close third-person POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through Elias's quiet observations.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and largely consistent, establishing a distinct, otherworldly tone. However, the presence of a jarring text artifact ("unpredictable室白鲟 in its intonations") during a climactic moment is a critical flaw. This error completely shatters the narrative immersion and disrupts the carefully crafted voice, representing a significant failure in execution that a prestigious publication would not overlook.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature; the world is filtered through a dye master's heightened sensitivity to light and color.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and effective psychic distance, and the voice possesses a distinct, lyrical texture that is perfectly suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece establishes and maintains a confident, lyrical voice with a consistent psychic distance. The POV is controlled, and the prose has a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and sound. The elevated, almost incantatory rhythm of the narration perfectly matches the ritualistic nature of the keeper's task, creating a seamless fusion of voice and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is tonally consistent with the character. However, the interiority lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading like an authorial summary of emotions rather than a character's immediate experience. This is most acute during the epiphany, which is articulated with a clarity that feels external to the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, melancholic voice that suits the story's aims. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature focused on quiet details and decay. The primary weakness is occasional register drift into awkward, academic phrasing, such as "heuristically gentle approach," which feels incongruous with the otherwise grounded and sensory narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice is tonally appropriate for the formal, dedicated protagonist, establishing a quiet, deliberate mood.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, creating a voice that is observant, calculated, and slightly detached, perfectly matching Eliza's character. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and goal-oriented, serving as a tool for misdirection rather than exposition. The prose maintains a consistent tone and rhythm that builds the story's unique atmosphere without any distracting shifts or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone that effectively supports the story's speculative-poetic aims. The POV is controlled and stable, with a clear perceptual signature focused on sensory data. The only minor weakness is the slight overuse of specific, abstract coinages ("terrestrially cosmic," "futuristic nostalgia") which can, at times, feel more like authorial labels than organic parts of the character's internal lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a heightened, lyrical register throughout. However, this consistency also leads to a certain flatness; the prose lacks modulation, even under pressure. While the point of view is expertly controlled, the unchanging, elevated tone can feel overwrought and lessens the impact of key emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The point of view is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, melancholic voice that perfectly suits the story's tone. The prose has a specific perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's unique focus on truth and preservation. The psychic distance pulls back slightly at the end for the thematic summary, but the core voice remains coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is the story's strongest asset. It maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical tone that perfectly suits the fable-like quality of the narrative. The psychic distance is expertly controlled, creating a sense of a legend being told. While the voice does not modulate to reflect pressure (as there is none), its sustained control and distinct texture are of a publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and effective, creating a voice that is fittingly detached yet tinged with a poetic sensibility. The prose maintains a distinct texture throughout. A minor flaw is the unexplained foreign word ("містул"), which momentarily breaks the narrative voice's established lexicon and feels like an unintegrated artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with clean competence and remains stable throughout the narrative. The narrative voice is warm and appropriate for the story's gentle, nostalgic tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct, memorable signature, and the dialogue, while functional for advancing the plot, rarely carries significant subtext or distinguishes the characters beyond their roles as information providers.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a distinct lyrical quality that fits the story's concept. The prose generally reflects Elara's methodical and graceful nature. The main weakness is the dialogue with Lydia, which feels less like a conversation and more like a setup for Elara to deliver the story's theme statement, momentarily flattening the established voice into a didactic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is lyrical, confident, and perfectly suited to the story's blend of melancholic ritual and magical realism. The point of view is controlled with precision, maintaining a close psychic distance that allows the speculative elements to feel emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a controlled, formal voice that suits the ritualistic tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on repeated phrases and a somewhat uniform sentence rhythm. This consistency, while maintaining tone, prevents the voice from achieving a truly unique or memorable texture, feeling more like a genre voice than an individual one.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, and the narrative voice has a consistent, gentle, and mysterious quality that suits the story. The dialogue is clear and serves the plot, but it leans toward the functional, with Mr. Abernathy in particular speaking as a conduit for exposition. More subtext and individual verbal mannerisms would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently with a lyrical, formal voice that suits the tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally feeling like a generalized high-fantasy register rather than the specific internal world of a "charmed skeptic." The prose is controlled but stops short of being uniquely character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its formal, slightly archaic tone. The prose carries a steady rhythm that fits the contemplative mood. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on familiar abstractions rather than a unique way of seeing the world, which keeps it from achieving top-tier distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV. The voice has a distinct, incantatory rhythm. Unfortunately, this rhythm is achieved through excessive, verbatim repetition of long, descriptive phrases, which ultimately reads as a mechanical artifact rather than an organic stylistic choice, keeping the reader at an analytical distance from the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, establishing a distinct lyrical and ethereal tone. Elara's perceptual signature as a "ghost whisperer" feels coherent, filtering the world through a supernatural lens. The prose is controlled and confident, though it doesn't take significant risks in form or style.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, creating a stable narrative distance. However, the narrative voice feels slightly mismatched with the character's described station. The lexicon ("scintillatingly," "demure audacity," "ephemeral foam") suggests a highly erudite narrator rather than the internal voice of a hands-on net-mender, creating a subtle but persistent register break that holds the piece back from full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The point of view is stable and serves the narrative well, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice is clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more functional than unique.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The point of view is controlled and consistent, maintaining a close third-person perspective that perfectly suits the isolated, cerebral nature of the protagonist.

The brief, reported dialogue serves its function efficiently without disrupting the established narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, wistful tone that suits the material. The third-person limited POV is controlled, staying firmly with the poet's perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is stable and effective, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice is functional and clear but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; the prose feels more like clean, competent narration than a unique character's internal filter. While technically sound, the voice doesn't modulate significantly under pressure or reveal idiosyncratic biases in what Elias notices, making it feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the story's meditative quality. However, it lacks a truly particular perceptual signature, at times feeling more like an omniscient narrator delivering a philosophical concept than a specific character's internal experience. The prose is beautiful but keeps the reader at a slight emotional distance from the mapper.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, maintaining a professional and analytical voice appropriate for the character. The narrative distance is stable, but the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a deliberate and contemplative voice that suits the character. The narrative distance is controlled effectively, drawing the reader into Father Michael's internal struggle. The dialogue serves the plot but occasionally veers into thematic exposition, particularly with Ms. Eleanor, whose final lines feel more like an authorial conclusion than a natural utterance from her established character.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance appropriate for a mechanical protagonist. However, the narrative voice is significantly weakened by the mechanical repetition of key phrases from the prompt, such as "steadily curious nature" and "yearning algorithm." This tic flattens the voice, making it feel less like a unique perceptual signature and more like an exercise in fulfilling requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a professional and focused narrative voice appropriate for Elara. The prose has a distinct rhythm and some evocative phrasing. However, the voice occasionally slips into generic or slightly overwritten constructions ("whispers from another dimension," "constellations in a dark sky others couldn't see") that soften the specificity of Elara's perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a suitable lyrical tone for a fantasy piece. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often relying on genre-standard phrasing ("language of darkness," "ancient rhythm"). It describes Elena's internal state competently but rarely feels as if it's emerging from a unique, specific consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical, and melancholic tone that suits the story's reflective nature. The POV is controlled, and Elena's perceptual signature is distinct. However, the dialogue, particularly Marcus's, occasionally slips from naturalism into being a delivery mechanism for thematic wisdom, and Elena's own final lines feel more like a thesis statement than spoken thought.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is compromised by a monotonous, templated cadence and a register that often feels too academic for the character ("intersubjective," "paradoxes"). The prose has a distinct rhythm, but it's one of mechanical repetition rather than organic flow, which flattens the emotional texture. This syntactic uniformity prevents the voice from achieving a truly unique or compelling signature.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and controlled psychic distance. The voice is distinct in its formal, mystical register, with a specialized lexicon that effectively builds the world's texture. While the voice is highly functional and fitting, it hews closely to its genre archetype without developing a truly unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently held, and the voice maintains a stable, gentle tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on generalized, abstract language ("shared understanding," "collective healing") that feels less like Elara's specific worldview and more like a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.7)
    The point of view is stable and the formal, reverent voice is consistent with the character's mindset. However, the prose is marred by a limited perceptual signature; we are told what the scholar thinks more than we experience the world through his unique senses. The highly repetitive phrasing, while perhaps aiming for a lyrical effect, ultimately creates a monotonous rhythm that flattens the voice's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the story's lyrical, melancholic tone. The point of view remains tightly controlled, effectively filtering the world through the prophet's unique perception. The caretaker's dialogue, while brief, leans slightly into exposition ("This piece was created by my grandmother..."), which momentarily flattens the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality appropriate for the tone. Elara's perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on mechanisms, vibrations, and subtle energies. The prose has a clear rhythm, though it sometimes settles into a stately, uniform cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person POV is stable and the voice is consistent, marked by a serene, reflective quality. The prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature. The only minor weakness is that the voice can feel slightly too literary and composed for an in-the-moment experience, reading more like a polished memoir than immediate interiority. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying significant subtext in the son's few words.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Point of view is consistent and the narrative voice is clear and appropriate for the genre. Psychic distance is well-controlled, maintaining focus on Elara's scholarly perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and effective, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that draws the reader into Eleanor's internal conflict. The narrative voice has a distinct, slightly formal texture that fits the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the story's contemplative tone.

The prose rhythm modulates effectively between her methodical work and her moments of reflection, creating a consistent and immersive narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a suitable contemplative and lyrical tone. However, the repetition of key phrases—"honeyed hush" appears three times, "protected vulnerability" twice—reads less like a deliberate motif and more like a narrative tic. This lexical recycling slightly dulls the prose's texture and makes the voice feel less particular than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, literary texture appropriate for a novelist focalizer. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader immersed in his reflective state.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a cohesive, fairy-tale-like tone. The prose rhythm fits the story's gentle, magical mood. While the voice is pleasant and suitable, it lacks a highly distinct or memorable perceptual signature that would elevate it beyond a well-executed genre style.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece maintains a consistent and effective third-person limited POV with a solemn, elevated voice that suits the material. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on the alchemist's process and sensory experience. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture, creating a trance-like feel. The voice is slightly static, showing little modulation even at the peak of the ritual, which prevents it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical and meditative tone consistent with its "reflective" protagonist. The prose effectively captures Elara's perceptual signature, focusing on patterns, light, and quiet details.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is the story's greatest strength: it is distinct, consistent, and perfectly calibrated to the mythic, ancient tone. Phrases like "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," and silence accumulating "like geological strata" create a unique and memorable perceptual signature. The POV is tightly controlled, and the prose rhythm effectively modulates the pace of the ritualistic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    The voice is the story's triumph—a perfect marriage of lyrical prose and grounded, practical perception. The POV is controlled with unwavering precision, establishing a distinct perceptual signature where rain recalls circus tents and a lion's mane represents love and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that suits the mythic quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, with no slips. The narrative voice is competent and clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; it feels more like a standard, slightly elevated narrative than the specific internal voice of a "functionally creative" engineer. The prose is functional rather than textured, missing an opportunity for the sentence rhythm and syntax to reflect Maya's precise, methodical mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice—contemplative and precise—is well-suited to an introverted clock scribe.

The piece succeeds in creating a coherent and character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a more generalized, lyrical authorial register. The prose texture remains uniform, failing to modulate with the rising internal stakes of the discovery. Elara’s thoughts are expressed in perfectly formed, abstract statements rather than fragmented, in-the-moment perceptions, which keeps the reader at a distance from her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is a perfect match for the "philosophical" protagonist—calm, observant, and measured.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct and lyrical. However, the voice's register occasionally feels too elevated or academic for intimate reflection ("the healing geography of human hearts," "intangible landscapes"). This creates a slight distance, making the otherwise close psychic perspective feel intermittently artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent with the story's high-fantasy, slightly formal tone. While the prose is clean and controlled, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, adhering closely to a competent but familiar "weary prince" archetype without offering a unique way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, shadow, and natural elements.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice. The prose has a distinct texture, though it occasionally strays into an overly ornate register that distances the reader from Elara's immediate experience. While the voice is consistent, it lacks a truly specific perceptual signature, reading more like a mythic narrator's voice than that of the "luminous skeptic" we are told Elara is.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story maintains a stable and controlled third-person POV with a distinct, elevated, and lyrical voice appropriate for the otherworldly protagonist. The use of the recurring phrase "Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" as a refrain is a strong stylistic choice that establishes a unique rhythm. The voice is consistent and effective, though its unwavering grandeur can feel somewhat impersonal and monotonous at times.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the meditative character and tone. The third-person limited POV remains strictly controlled, offering a distinct perceptual signature focused on texture, light, and memory.

The prose has a consistent, rhythmic quality that supports the story’s atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    Point of view is stable and third-person limited is an appropriate choice.

At key moments, the voice slips from Alaric's immediate experience into a more omniscient, explanatory mode that flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is controlled and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story's contemplative mood. The psychic distance is managed effectively, drawing the reader into Elias's focused state. While the prose is elegant, it lacks a truly distinctive rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is maintained with consistency and control, and the elevated, almost formal voice suits the story's mythic quality. However, the narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the prose describes Elara’s thoughts and feelings with a certain distance, rather than filtering the world through her unique, groundedly imaginative lens. It reads more as a report on a mind than an inhabitation of one.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a consistent and immersive narrative voice. The prose has a distinct lyrical texture that aligns perfectly with the story's tone ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous").

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and controlled, maintaining a somber, lyrical tone that suits the material.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The point of view is controlled and consistent, maintaining a close third-person perspective that aligns perfectly with Milo's intellectual and observant nature. The voice has a distinct, measured rhythm. A minor weakness is the repetition of key adjectival phrases ("rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm"), which, while reinforcing character, creates a slight template cadence that feels less organic than the rest of the prose. This repetitive self-labeling slightly flattens the voice's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the character's thoughtful, formal persona. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading as a somewhat generic "literary" style. The dialogue is a significant weak point; it is stiff and primarily serves to deliver thematic exposition, sounding more like a lecture than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is largely controlled, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative mood. However, the piece suffers from jarring register drift with the inclusion of the clinical term "synaptic plasticity." This phrase feels like an authorial intrusion, breaking the established voice and pulling the reader out of Elias's otherwise poetic and grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is clear, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The dialogue is overwhelmingly functional, serving primarily to extract exposition from Elara. Key conversations lack subtext or indirection, with characters speaking their intentions and the story's themes plainly, which flattens their interactions into plot-delivery mechanisms.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is the story's greatest strength, maintaining a lyrical and consistent tone that is both quiet and intense ("hushed blaze"). The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, filtering all perception through Aria’s unique sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, creating a voice that is fittingly cerebral and determined. The narrative distance is stable, and the internal world of Elias is well-rendered. The primary weakness is a slight lack of rhythmic variety and a reliance on repeating key phrases ("balancedly daring," "grim optimism"), which gives the voice a somewhat mechanical feel under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, creating a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's meditative tone. The narrative stance is stable, and the painter's perceptual signature is clear in her focus on light, language, and scent.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The point of view is controlled and consistent, with a distinct narrative voice that aligns perfectly with the "cultured museum guide" character. The prose has a specific, somewhat formal rhythm that enhances the character's "historically oriented" perspective. The sparse dialogue is impactful, with Khira's "The bread remembers" carrying immense weight. The inclusion of the Chinese characters "决心" is a bold, effective stylistic choice that adds specificity and texture to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent, slightly formal voice that matches the story's mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's somber, mythic tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; the prose is clean and effective but rarely surprising in its rhythm or word choice. It serves the story well without rising to the level of a memorable, character-specific style.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical consistency, and the voice aligns with the character's academic profession. However, the narrative voice is overly formal and explanatory, relying on abstract summaries ("systematic alteration of history") rather than an immersive, character-particular perspective. The prose often describes the story from the outside rather than allowing the reader to experience it through the character's senses and thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story's mood. However, the prose occasionally drifts into a register that feels more like an authorial overlay than the authentic perspective of a "firm shore surveyor," creating a subtle but persistent distance from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the character of a logical archivist. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or memorable texture.

The prose is clean and functional, but lacks a truly unique rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would elevate it to a higher tier of voice work.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, maintaining appropriate psychic distance. The narrative voice, however, occasionally slips into a generic, elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound ("painted the sky in shades of twilight blue and violet," "liquid night"). While functional, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature rooted in a former military operator's mindset, reading more like standard high-concept sci-fi narration.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with skill and confidence, and the psychic distance shifts smoothly between external action and internal reflection. The narrative voice has a distinct, melancholic texture that is consistent and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the scene's tension. The narrative voice is clear and controlled but lacks a truly distinct texture, occasionally slipping into a more summary-like register ("This particular exchange was especially challenging..."). The dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and effective, carrying significant subtext in its brevity, which contrasts well with the sometimes overly explanatory internal narration.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance that suits the reflective narrative. Elena’s perceptual signature is clear, focused on the sea, the sky, and the markers of navigation that define her world. The voice is coherent and modulates appropriately from melancholic reflection to a quiet, renewed purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a fitting tone of weary discovery. The point of view is controlled, with no knowledge leaks or unmotivated shifts. The dialogue, though brief, is purposeful and delivers the story's crucial turning point efficiently. The prose has a distinct, slightly formal texture, but lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier; it is highly competent but not unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for a modern fairy tale. The minimal dialogue is effective, carrying an otherworldly quality that suits the scene. While the voice is highly competent and fits the story's aims perfectly, it doesn't possess a truly singular or surprising stylistic signature that would push it into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the lyrical voice is well-suited to the fantastical subject matter. The narrative distance is controlled effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone appropriate for the story's grand scale. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture, lending weight to the proceedings. While effective, the voice remains at a somewhat formal, elevated psychic distance, which occasionally keeps the reader from feeling the full, visceral immediacy of Eli's internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, fittingly philosophical tone. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on generic phrasing. The repetition of key motifs like "vibrant hush" feels more like a deliberate authorial device than an organic element of the character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with clean, consistent control. However, the narrative voice is more formal and descriptive than it is a distinct perceptual signature of the protagonist. While the prose is elevated and matches the tone, it lacks the character-particular texture and rhythm that would fully immerse the reader in Elias's specific worldview under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and filtering the fantastical events through the character's specific perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, fitting for a poet. The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the narrative distance is effective for the reflective tone. The prose occasionally becomes so elevated and self-aware (e.g., describing her own process as "distilling the complex pain... into crystalline verses") that it risks sounding more like the author analyzing the character than the character simply thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct and suited to an intellectual protagonist. The prose carries a formal, controlled rhythm. Dialogue is the weakest aspect; while functional, it serves primarily as a vehicle for Aris to deliver exposition about his philosophy, making the student feel more like a prompt than a character.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and lyrical, perfectly suited to the "vagrant penny poet." The third-person limited POV maintains a controlled psychic distance, and the poet's perceptual signature—seeing the world through metaphors of words and rebellion—is strong and unwavering. The prose rhythm supports the meditative, determined tone, creating a narrative that feels like a prose poem without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that befits the character and tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical setting through the pianist's melancholy worldview. The lack of dialogue is a valid choice that keeps the focus tight on his internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, maintaining a clear focus on Elara's experience. The narrative voice is functional and suits the high-fantasy tone. However, the prose sometimes slips into summary and abstraction ("The collective memory of her people was fading," "Her empirically whimsical nature made her uniquely suited for this task") where a more embodied, perceptual voice would have been more immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    The voice is exceptionally well-controlled, maintaining a slow, lyrical, and contemplative cadence that perfectly matches the protagonist and his ritual. The point of view is stable, and the character's perceptual signature is distinct, consistently filtering the world through the lenses of his craft and his grief. This is the story's most significant achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation matching emotional crests. Perceptual signature is musician-centric: “melodies flowed like the dreams he could never quite remember.” No head-hopping; POV stays tight. Compression is purposeful (“he would return… carrying with him the promise”) and paid off in closure. Diction remains within pianist’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited voice is stable; lyric rhythms modulate under emotional pressure; occasional ornamental phrases (“beneath the curtain of water into cooler air and shadow”) verge on purple but stay within character-filter.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is slow, lyrical, and consistent; syntax mirrors the tutor’s cadence. No dialogue, so no risk of convergence. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in the final image.
