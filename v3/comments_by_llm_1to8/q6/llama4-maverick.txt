    The voice maintains consistency in its contemplative register, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond academic observation. No dialogue appears to test character distinction. The prose stays within Maria's plausible lexicon as a researcher, but repetitive constructions ("Maria's thoughts turned to...") create mechanical transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction - it could belong to any contemplative protagonist. Phrases like "drifting resonance" and "ethereal light" feel borrowed from literary templates rather than emerging from this specific character's perception. No dialogue means we miss opportunities for voice contrast or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative moments ("winterglass," "symphony of silence"). However, the voice lacks distinctiveness—the survivor's perceptual signature doesn't reflect her specific trauma or expertise. Abstract phrases like "catalyst for her creativity" and "mesmerizing display of color and pattern" feel writerly rather than character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistent distance and atmospheric tone appropriate to the contemplative subject. Some effective moments emerge ("tomes bound in material that shimmered like the moon"). However, the prose tends toward tell-mode summary ("Years passed, and the library became a haven") and lacks distinct perceptual signature that would make the undertaker's perspective memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice remains competent but generic, lacking distinctive perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation. Dialogue exists only as Akira's speech, which reads as written prose rather than natural speech. The narration maintains steady distance without purposeful shifts to heighten emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register appropriate to Aria's artistic sensibility, with phrases like "foggy lucidity" and "pilgrim of sparks" creating atmosphere. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Aria observes as a generic spiritual seeker rather than specifically as a camera obscura artist whose profession should color her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some distinctive touches ("quaking reverie," "lotus flower" unfolding). However, the prose tends toward elevated abstraction ("metaphysical odyssey," "hidden harmony") that distances rather than immerses. The narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Elian observes but doesn't filter experience through a unique lens shaped by their maze-designing expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.1)
    Distant third-person narration lacks distinct texture or perceptual signature, reading like consensus prose rather than a particular mind observing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance with controlled diction appropriate to Lyra's technical mindset ("calibrated her prototype," "crystalline note"). Her synesthetic perception creates a distinct perceptual signature, though some passages drift into explanatory register ("a sound she had been searching for years to help her clients heal").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose maintains consistent ethereal register but lacks distinct character voice - Lumina's perceptual signature never emerges beyond generic poetic observation. Repetitive constructions ("Lumina felt," "As the," "With the") create monotonous rhythm. The narrative voice reads like creative writing workshop prose rather than a specific consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency and has moments of lyrical control ("kaleidoscope of colors," "weighty lightness"). However, the dramatic self-narration device feels forced and the POV occasionally slips into omniscient summary ("The world, once frozen and unforgiving"). Dialogue absence isn't penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate vocabulary for a stunt double's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent meditative register with controlled rhythm, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic introspection. No dialogue appears to test voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person distance but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the dresser's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Voice modulates little under the supposed emotional peaks, maintaining steady literary register throughout without compression or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency and the prose has moments of distinct texture ("within the hush of beating wings at rest").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction, relying on generic literary phrasing ("eerie shadows," "otherworldly glow"). Multiple filter constructions dilute immediacy ("Rachel felt herself becoming," "seemed to vibrate"). The POV provides no unique perceptual signature—Rachel as musician doesn't filter the world through musical specificity beyond surface mentions of notes and chords.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled vocabulary ("palimpsest," "liminal," "crucible"). However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature - Aria observes generically rather than through a specific professional or personal lens. The elevated diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("context-dependent construct") that distances rather than immerses.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture, relying on competent but unremarkable prose ("dim light crept," "air was heavy").

The POV's perceptual signature doesn't sufficiently distinguish this explorer from any urban explorer archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose maintains consistent gothic register but lacks distinct character voice - this could be any omniscient narrator describing any mystic keeper. No dialogue to evaluate, and the POV never develops a perceptual signature beyond generic mystical observation. Repetitive phrasing ("chronicle keeper" appears 30 times) creates monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with phrases like "bronze quiet" and "weathered walls bearing scars." However, the voice lacks distinctiveness—it could belong to any literary narrator describing any mysterious archive.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—it could belong to any story about mysterious encounters. POV remains stable but the perceptual signature is generic (shadows, dim light, mysterious atmosphere) without character-specific ways of noticing. The absence of dialogue removes a key opportunity for voice distinction and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the priest notices everything with equal, detached clarity. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The narrative stance remains safely elevated without modulation for emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the narrator notices everything with equal, writerly attention rather than character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with phrases like "periodically eternal existence" establishing a distinctive register. However, abstract declarations dominate over embodied perception—"Time itself became fluid" and "The world was remade" tell rather than show through the protagonist's specific sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent meditative register appropriate to the contemplative tone. Some effective phrases like "enthrall the cavern, drawing the shadows closer" create atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond generic literary description. Phrases like "layered tranquility" and "contemplative silence" read as writerly constructions rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction, and the prose defaults to elevated register during what should be stress moments.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with Elara's perceptual filter (focusing on scents, light, botanical details befitting a "lantern broker"). However, the narrative voice lacks distinct texture—sentences follow similar patterns, and emotional moments rely on telling ("felt a sense of awe," "felt a deep connection") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction, reading as standardized literary prose without character-specific perception. POV control is stable but the narrative stance feels detached and explanatory rather than embodied, with phrases like "passionate subtlety" and "ethereal glow" suggesting template diction over authentic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice remains generic literary third-person without distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue appears despite two characters conversing extensively - all exchanges are summarized. POV control is stable but lacks the texture and specificity that would distinguish Lena's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance and the voice has some texture in its descriptions. However, the narration tends toward explanatory summary ("Kael felt deeply connected") rather than embodied perception, and lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical-lyrical register appropriate to Lyra's artistic perspective. Perceptual details like "serpentine waterway" and "gentle lapping" establish voice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance for a mystical narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with phrases like "sapphire hush" and "labyrinthine corridors," though this elevated diction sometimes feels disconnected from a crawl space dweller's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness—it reads as generic literary prose without character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction - "I couldn't help but feel" appears twice, suggesting template phrasing. The stranger's dialogue is absent, missing an opportunity for contrast. Perceptual signature is generic; an insomniac painter should notice light and color differently but we get standard observations.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited but suffers from elevated register drift incompatible with intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - the archivist notices things generically ("eyes scanning," "gaze fell upon") without character-specific selection bias. Dialogue appears only briefly through the shopkeeper's "Welcome" without revealing subtext. The prose voice reads competent but interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness - Emilia's voice could belong to any fantasy protagonist. Phrases like "trembling certainty" and "analytically artistic" feel decorative rather than voice-driven. The narrative distance remains steady but never modulates with emotional intensity or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistent mystical-literary register but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Emilia notices everything with equal articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate for an immortal protagonist, and phrases like "hushed thunder" create atmospheric texture. However, the prose suffers from filter-heavy construction ("Kael understood," "Kael's heart stirred") and abstract telling ("otherworldly energy," "electric tension") that distances the reader from immediate experience. The duplicate's dialogue lacks distinction from Kael's own voice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with effective modulation between Lena's uncertainty and growing determination. Perceptual signature shows in how she notices morbid beauty and reads the room's "deathly vitality." The father's dialogue ("We're making progress," "You're a natural, kiddo") carries appropriate subtext. Some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she knew") in the final third dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, contemplative diction appropriate to the scholarly stationer. Perceptual signature is clear in how she notices vibrations and subtle textures. However, the prose lacks rhythmic variation under different moments - morning's arrival doesn't shift the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent melancholic register appropriate to the concept, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Elara notices things generically rather than through a specific professional or personal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited perspective with some evocative phrasing ("mist-coated," "beacon of industrious tranquility"). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("her entire being," "every molecule in the air").

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, though Emilia's perceptual signature remains generic (atlas editor who notices patterns).

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice maintains consistent third-person limited perspective with poetic register ("haunted optimistic vision," "orchid solace") but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices everything with equal articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, sensory-rich texture appropriate to the accumulative mode ("fingers moved deftly," "swirling vortex of noise and color").

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stable third‑person distance and consistent, meditative diction. Rhythm is monotone with repeated openings (“The survivor…,” “As the…”), limiting dynamic control. Voice feels generic lyric rather than character‑particular. No dialogue to test modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    A consistent, lyrical third‑person voice sustains mood; diction is mostly controlled and aligned. Repetitive stems (“The myth buster…”) and echoing phrases thin rhythmic variety at peak beats. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; psychic distance is stable. The cadence suits the accumulative design but could cut redundancy for sharper charge.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person distance is steady and legible; diction is clean but generic. Phrases like “redevelopment”/“modernization” in quotes do some tonal work but slide toward corporate register without a sharpened POV. Rhythm is competent, if uniform. Lack of dialogue limits texture and subtextual play.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    A consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence suits the meditative aim. Occasional redundancies and elevated diction dull compression and edge toward purple. No head‑hopping or stance slips; POV modesty stays plausible. Rhythm could tighten under peak beats to avoid blur.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close third with a measured, lyric cadence that suits Emilia’s methodical attention.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV and register are consistent; the lyric diction suits the haunted setting. Recurrent phrases (“thread the labyrinth,” “copperlight repose,” “hover between shadows and light”) unify tone but verge on sameness. Distance control is steady, with no leakage or head-hopping. The voice is distinctive but not dynamically modulated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    A consistent, lyrical third‑person maintains stable distance and perceptual focus. Diction is controlled, if occasionally generic (“otherworldly energy,” “secrets”).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    A consistent close third with lyrical texture and steady psychic distance; perception favors wet, fungal light and choral sound.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    The single-POV lyric voice is consistent and plausibly filtered through a translator’s pattern-seeking mind. Rhythm and diction fit a meditative register, though repeated constructions (“As…,” “The…”) create a drumbeat. No dialogue to test modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third‑person voice is steady and readable, with occasional lyric turns that suit the premise. However, diction is largely generic and explanatory; the “candidly cryptic” sensibility doesn’t shape syntax or perception in distinctive ways. Distance stays consistent but safe. No taught elision or sharp modulation at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    Unified lyric voice with controlled imagery and consistent POV; no head‑hopping. Rhythm carries the accumulative build, though diction occasionally edges toward purple and repeats coinages (“reef‑shadow joy,” “half‑sung lullaby”). The modulation from hush to uplift is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable and legible; the voice is consistently hushed and incantatory. Diction trends toward uniform lyricism, producing a monotone that blunts peaks. Patterned phrases feel authored rather than character‑specific perception. Controlled, but not dynamically modulated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Consistent close third with a gentle lyric cadence; imagery and lexicon align with the world. Some syntactic and diction repetition dulls the edge (“The recollectionist…” stem repeats). No dialogue—voice has to carry momentum solo and mostly does. The modulation at the realization beat is controlled but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is steady and diction controlled, with a lyrical tilt that suits the piece. However, repetition of set phrases (“orchestrated serendipity,” “lightly attentive”) flattens texture. Rhythm is competent but rarely surprises under peak beats. No dialogue to complicate voice or add subtext.

    POV is stable and consistent; the voice is gently lyrical and unified. Repetition patterns create cadence but also sameness, with limited modulation at peak beats. Distance control is steady, if a bit summary-heavy. No dialogue means the voice must carry more weight than it does.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV and tense are stable with a coherent lyric voice. Diction is consistent but edges toward purple and repetitive (“dusky harmony,” multiple “As…” openers).

    The third‑person close maintains a consistent lyrical timbre—measured, imagistic, calm under pressure. Diction fits the meditative register and stays stable. While occasionally abstract (“fierce repose,” “woven hush”), it remains legible and in character. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stable close third with a controlled lyric register; rhythm rises to a crescendo then settles into a “forged hush.” Diction is consistent, if somewhat generalized and ceremonious.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent close third with a gentle, painterly diction suits the piece. Rhythm is smooth, if sometimes uniform. A few repeated constructions and phrases soften distinctiveness, but POV control remains steady. No dialogue to stress-test modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and coherent with Elian’s sensibility; psychic distance stays stable. Repetition supports the meditative mode without slipping into head-hopping or register breaks. At peaks, diction trends toward abstract intensifiers that blur specificity (“palpable energy,” “screaming tenderness”). Still, rhythm and cadence are largely controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable and confident, with a consistent lyrical register. Diction occasionally lapses into generic uplift, and repetitive sentence openings (“The navigator…”) flatten rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and diction consistent, with a cool, analytic tone befitting the “rational” forager. The voice is competent but occasionally generic and expository. Rhythm is even; moments of lyric lift appear around the orchard and final image. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is consistent and modestly close; the observational voice suits the piece. Diction is controlled, occasionally lyrical, but leans on repetition (“mist,” “isolation”) that flattens rhythmic variation. No dialogue appears, so voice differentiation isn’t tested. The prose remains coherent under pressure, if a bit uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third‑person voice is serviceable but generic, with repetitive structures (“As she…,” “As the creek…”). Distance stays stable, though diction lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm is monotone in places, relying on summary cadence over scene texture. No dialogue pressure to test subtext or status.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third‑person close remains stable and lyrical, but the voice leans on filter stacks (“she felt,” “it was as if”) and repeated constructions that blur pressure.

The perceptual signature is pleasant but not distinct under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stable close third with consistent lyric diction; the “scientifically romantic” voice colors perception. Rhythm is mostly controlled, if occasionally repetitive (“As she…” openings). No head‑hopping or stance drift. Register matches the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with consistent stance. Repetition and abstraction sap some vitality, but distance and certainty remain plausible. No head-hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third‑person voice is stable and textured, with a consistent lyric register suited to the material.

Rhythm modulates at the climax (hum → stillness) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is steady and legible, with a consistent elevated lyric register. Diction sometimes drifts into generic mysticism and repetition, flattening the perceptual signature. Rhythm is controlled but uniform, with few pressure‑modulated shifts. No head‑hopping or stance breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent, calm, and slightly ceremonial, matching the “fjord quiet” tone. Repetitions (“shepherd,” “counting backwards,” “mantle clock key”) achieve chant‑like texture but also slide toward redundancy. Diction occasionally bumps (“eminently peculiar”) without deepening perspective. POV remains stable and modest, with no unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is steady and legible with consistent reflective distance. Diction is mostly controlled, though it drifts abstract (“physics of letting go,” “new paradigm”). Rhythm is smooth but occasionally uniform. The voice feels competent more than singularly distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable and the diction suits an academic mind, with consistent focalization. Some abstract phrasing and repeated constructions blunt edge and rhythm (“seemed to glow,” “felt a sense”).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable and modest; voice is competent but generic for this register, relying on summary cadence. Phrasing often repeats (“As the night wore on”) and leans declarative, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close third with a lyrical, sensorily attuned diction fits the protagonist. Rhythm is controlled with recurring phrases that mostly feel intentional. Occasional sameness of cadence and reiterated constructions flatten peaks slightly. No POV slippage or head‑hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is consistent and modestly lyrical, with controlled distance and no head‑hopping. Diction is steady but leans generic (“whispers of the cosmos,” “strange comfort”) rather than a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm is smooth, if a bit uniform. Absence of dialogue is fine for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is steady and confident, with a consistent lyrical distance. Diction is clean but leans on repeated stems (“The advisor…”) and generalized abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, with a steady third‑person close and controlled diction. Rhythms and syntactic patterns repeat (“a testament,” “the power of art,” “as Elian...”), creating mild monotony.

Dialogue absence is appropriate here.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lyric third‑person closely tracks Lyra’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are consistent and apt. Some syntactic sameness and recycled constructions dull peaks (“dissolving boundaries,” “tremor of certainty” repeats). No POV leakage or head‑hopping. The voice sustains atmosphere but could flex more under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is calm, lyrical, and consistent; POV distance is stable with light omniscient drift that doesn’t confuse. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Diction tends toward generic uplift and repetition rather than a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm is smooth but uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV is stable and diction is consistently lyric. Repetitive syntactic stems (“As…”, “The prism-song bell ringer…”) blunt rhythm. The closing meta sentence fractures voice authority. Still, the perceptual filter (sound-driven noticing) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    A consistent, quiet lyric voice suits the material; diction is controlled and generally character‑plausible. Rhythm occasionally lapses into repetition (“stars shone bright” and parallel structures) and summary. POV remains stable and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is steady and controlled; the lyric cadence is consistent with Maya’s contemplative stance. Diction occasionally lapses into familiar eco-poetic phrasing (“sentinel,” “whisper secrets,” “beacon”), blunting distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stable third‑person close with a consistent, softly lyrical register.

The voice holds together but lacks a sharper perceptual signature under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close third with a controlled, incantatory rhythm suited to the premise. Some syntactic sameness and filter-verb reliance flatten peaks (“she felt,” “she knew”), but POV boundaries are clean. The voice sustains lyric density without confusion. Modulation at the turn (time folding to hush) registers, if modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyric third‑person close is consistent, with a measured, incantatory rhythm suited to accumulation. The perceptual signature favors atmosphere over analysis and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    POV is stable and modest, but diction is generic and repetitive, with many sentences starting “As she…” or leaning on abstract intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable and consistent, but diction trends generic‑lyric with repetition (“reestablish,” “connection”) diluting texture. The perceptual signature of a cuneiform translator rarely inflects phrasing or noticing. Rhythm is steady but uniform, with few pressured modulations.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence; no head‑hopping. Some diction and phrase repetition (“stars… twinkle,” “sense of”) flatten rhythm. Voice holds pattern but rarely sharpens under peak beats. Overall legible and stable, if slightly generic in timbre.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable and lyric without head-hopping, with a consistent distance suited to a timeless reaper. Diction is controlled, though sometimes generic and repetitive (“As…,” “echo”). Rhythm supports the gradual swell and release. No dialogue needed; narrative confidence matches the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    A consistent, lyrical third‑person voice with controlled diction and rhythm; imagery like “each drop… a tiny, musical ring” feels owned by the POV. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional elevated abstractions dull immediacy but do not break control. Modulation toward the climax is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a stable third‑person close. Diction sometimes drifts toward abstraction and repetition, which flattens intensity (“precisely humane,” “mirrored hush”). The perceptual signature is steady but not highly idiosyncratic. Rhythm is pleasant yet samey under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable, lyrical third with consistent diction suited to a contemplative alchemist. Rhythm is smooth, though occasionally monotone in its reverent register. No head‑hopping or unjustified knowledge claims. Some repetition of phrasing dilutes distinctiveness at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is steady and diction coherent with a lyrical, observant stance. Rhythms are controlled, though syntactic and phrase repetitions create a mild drumbeat. No dialogue to test modulation. Voice feels competent but not singularly distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is steady and legible; voice is consistent but lapses into therapy/philosophical jargon that blunts immediacy. Repetitive sentence stems (“As he…,” “He…”) create a drumbeat rhythm. Lyric aspirations are present, yet modulation under pressure is limited. No dialogue to test distinction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable and consistent; the diction is gently elevated and mostly controlled. Recurrent phrasing (“flow,” “storm‑born silence”) builds a pattern but edges toward sameness. The perceptual signature is competent yet generic; little idiolect sets her apart. Rhythm is even, with limited modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyric voice is stable and apt, with controlled cadence and consistent distance. Some diction trends purple or clichéd (“vanished into the shadows,” “true haunting”), but the tonal fabric holds. No head-hopping; stance remains coherent. Rhythm mostly serves the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent lyric third-person close with a distinct, mist-suffused diction. Rhythm holds, with a controlled, incantatory cadence. Occasional pseudo-abstract phrasing (“interiorize exteriors,” “dimensional harmonics”) edges toward register bloat but remains legible. No head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent single‑POV lyric voice with controlled cadence and a clear perceptual filter. Diction sometimes drifts toward lofty generalities, risking sameness in rhythm. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. The voice carries atmosphere reliably through the crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable and filtered through Aria’s sensibility; diction is consistently lyrical without head‑hopping. Rhythms are smooth, though repetitions (“serenely electric,” thematic phrasing) create sameness in cadence. The narrator’s certainty sometimes over‑explains insights that imagery could imply. Overall voice control is competent and coherent for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable and legible; narration maintains a consistent lyrical register. Brief dialogue with Marcus feels natural and serves function without over‑explanation. Diction occasionally tends purple, but rhythm remains controlled and readable. The perceptual signature is competent if not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is steady, controlled, and suited to a lyric mode; POV is stable with no leakage. Rhythmic control is decent, though repeated constructions (“The architect…,” “The thread…”) create a drumbeat. Diction aligns with the persona’s sensibility. The compression works but could vary cadence at peaks for sharper charge.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is steady and diction consistent with a reflective, lyrical register. Rhythm is serviceable but repetitive, with recurring stems and abstract nouns dampening freshness. No dialogue means voice must carry action; it trends toward summary and generalities. Moments of image (velvet expanse, diamonds) help but pattern sameness persists.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is steady and modest, with a controlled, lyrical cadence that suits the hush. Diction is consistent, if occasionally generic, and avoids head‑hopping. Repetition of sentence stems (“Aria… She…”) and familiar formulations flatten the voice at peaks. Dialogue is sparse but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third‑person limited is steady and coherent; diction remains consistent and readable. Occasional lyric phrasing (“crashing hush”) adds texture without muddling clarity. Absence of dialogue avoids pitfalls but also limits dynamic modulation of voice. The narrative stance sometimes explains rather than lets perception do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is controlled and consistent, with a lucid, meditative cadence that suits the accumulative design. Some syntactic repetition (“As…” openings, parallel structures) reduces rhythmic variety. No head‑hopping; psychic distance stays stable. Diction remains coherent and within a plausible lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct cadence that suits the meditative mode. Repetitive sentence stems and declarative intensifiers occasionally flatten modulation. No dialogue to stress‑test idiom; the narrator’s certainty rarely wavers, keeping distance steady. Control is good, if not nimble under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is stable and close, with a consistent lyric register. Diction sometimes tilts into prompt‑y abstraction (“gravitationally playful,” “frostbitten hope,” “missing return changed”) that the voice hasn’t fully earned. Rhythm is serviceable but leans repetitive in phrasing. No head‑hopping or stance drift occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent, lyrical third‑person voice suits the fable‑like frame. POV distance is stable; no head‑hopping. Rhythm can flatten into repetition (“resonantly soft,” mechanical world) and explanatory telling, which blunts intensity. Still, diction is coherent and the cadence supports the serene closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable and coherent; diction and rhythm are controlled with a mild lyric tilt. The voice is competent but occasionally expository, preferring summary to textured thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable and modest; the lyric voice is consistent and suits the meditative mode. Diction is largely clean and unforced, with recurring motifs tying cadence. Occasional generic phrasing and repetition flatten peak beats slightly. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV distance and stance are consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register. Diction suits the meditative mode, and rhythm steadies as urgency rises. Some repetition of sentence stems (“As she…,” “The librarian…”) flattens cadence. Still, the voice is coherent and apt for the design.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and confident in a close third that feels fused with Elian’s sensibility. Diction stays steady and supports the atmosphere. The uniform register risks sameness, but it remains legible and controlled. Absence of dialogue suits the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is stable and confident, with a consistent lyric register. Diction and rhythm fit the fable‑like frame, though repetition (“the locksmith…”) and elevated abstractions flatten texture at peaks. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Overall, a controlled but somewhat uniform voice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third‑person voice is stable and consonant with a lyrical, folkloric sensibility. Diction is controlled and mostly within Emilia’s plausible perceptual range.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    A consistent close-third lyric voice with measured cadence suits the meditative pressure. Diction and rhythm modulate as discovery intensifies; no head-hopping or stance slips. Occasional declaratives explain intent, but most meaning rides image and action. The perceptual signature (precision yoked to tenderness) remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single, stable POV with a consistent lyrical register. Diction is controlled, but the voice tends toward generalized reverence rather than a distinct, character‑particular idiom. Rhythm becomes uniform through repeated constructions, flattening intensity. No head‑hopping or stance slips, though.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single close third is steady; diction and rhythm are controlled and suit a meditative mode. Some lexical recycling creates a drumbeat that flattens peaks, but voice remains coherent. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A touch more modulation at climax would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stable close third with a measured, lyrical cadence suits the contemplative mode. Diction is consistent with a meticulous observer, though some generic formulations flatten texture. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; rhythm is even if somewhat uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first‑person reflective voice is consistent, textured, and plausibly analytic without slipping registers. Rhythm varies well between image and thought; no head‑hopping or stance breaches. Compression supports lyric accumulation. A few aphoristic phrasings skim the edge of abstraction but the voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV and stance are stable with a consistent lyric register; image patterns (mist, hum, ozone, “tinkersong”) recur coherently. Rhythm is readable, though syntactic repetition and similar clause structures creep in under pressure. Diction suits the mode but sometimes slides toward generic mystical phrasing. No head‑hopping or stance leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is steady, diction consistent, and the lyric tone coherent. However, repetition of constructions (“Elara…”) and generic abstractions dilute texture. The voice’s rhythm is competent but rarely surprising; subtext is thin because pressure is low. Clean control, modest individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical register that suits a reflective meteorologist. The diction (“spooled wholeness,” “empty spaces”) repeats but maintains a distinct signature. Minimal dialogue avoids missteps. Rhythm is controlled, if occasionally lush.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is controlled, calm, and consistently close-third, with lyrical cadence that fits the hush.

Rhythm holds through closure without slips in stance or tense.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable and close, with a consistent lyric texture suited to Eli’s meticulous noticing. Cadence and diction are controlled, though there’s some repeated “As…” openings that create a mild drumbeat. No dialogue appears, appropriately avoiding false dramatics. Overall voice is coherent and character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyrical third-person close is steady and appropriate; diction and rhythm are consistent. No head-hopping or stance slips, and the perceptual signature (indigo eyes, frost, hush) is coherent. Some repeated constructions and favored phrases flatten variety. Overall control is strong though not extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    A consistent, gently lyrical omniscience carries the narrative without head‑hopping or stance drift. Diction is even and readable, though it flattens immediacy into summary. Rhythmic control is steady but rarely presses or releases to match tension. The voice feels serviceable rather than distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV and stance are stable; diction is lyrically consistent with controlled cadence. The perceptual signature favors hush, pattern, and minute craft, fitting the adjuster’s role. Repetition (“hush,” “fragile,” “balance”) edges toward monotony but does not break voice. No head‑hopping or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is steady and diction coherent, with a measured, fable‑like cadence. Some lines verge on generic (“weight of her task,” “renewed urgency”) but clarity holds. The “offhandedly exact” register blip jars slightly without being earned by voice. Rhythm is smooth, if safe.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is steady and plausible, with consistent access and diction. The voice is competent but leans generic, with repeated cadences (“As the…,” “The sound of…”) and platitudinal closers. No dialogue to test modulation or subtext. Rhythmic control is even but lacks distinctiveness under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyric third‑person voice is steady and suited to the piece’s aims, with controlled diction and consistent distance. Repetitive stems (“As she…”) and abstract nouns slightly dull rhythm under peak beats. POV modesty holds; no head‑hopping. A touch more syntactic variation and embodied texture would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is steady and confident, with a coherent lyric register. Diction and rhythm are consistent, though repetitive sentence stems (“As she...”) and echoing phrases dilute texture. Distance control remains clean with no head-hopping. The voice fits the fable-like mode but could vary cadence for pressure peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical third‑person voice is consistent and confident, with controlled cadence and diction suited to the meditative mode. Dialogue is summarized rather than dramatized, which keeps subtext shallow but maintains tonal unity. No POV leakage, but the distance stays safely ornamental at peak beats. Rhythmic variety is adequate if occasionally purple.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stable single-POV with a consistent lyrical register; diction and rhythm fit the contemplative mode. At times the voice leans abstract and self-declarative, reducing immediacy. No head-hopping or stance slippage. The cadence holds, if a bit uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person close remains stable and apt; diction is controlled and consistent with the tale’s mystical register. Some syntactic sameness and filter-verb reliance (“she felt,” “she knew,” “she realized”) damp immediacy. The perceptual signature (archival eye mapping symbols to space) shows, though it could be sharper under stress. No head-hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The POV is steady, close, and competent, with diction that fits a “symphonically minded” artisan. Rhythms are measured and consistent with the intensely quiet tone. No head‑hopping or stance slips occur; compression reads intentional. Slight sameness of cadence and a few declarative tells keep it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical register that fits the contemplative mode. Diction and rhythm are steady, if occasionally inflated, without head‑hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is steady and intimate with a consistent lyrical register. Diction is controlled overall, though occasional abstraction (“path to empathy,” “frequencies of her surroundings”) skews expository. Rhythm suits the hush of the scene. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorially tuned to Lyra’s nose‑forward perception. Diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “wildflower hush”) but remains legible and in character. Distance is stable; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. Rhythm is varied enough to maintain flow, if at times florid.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable and modest; diction is clean but not especially distinctive. The voice often defaults to summary beats (“Lyra noticed… Lyra realized…”), muting urgency. Rhythmic control is steady but lacks modulation at pressure peaks. No dialogue to test, and the perception feels competent rather than idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third‑person limited voice is consistent and sensorial, with professional noticing lending character. Rhythm is steady but occasionally generic, with repeated constructions and abstractions (“the silence seemed to…”). No dialogue pressure to test voice under strain. Overall control holds, but the diction leans safe.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person close remains steady; diction is lyrical and controlled. Some phrasing edges toward purple and repeats (“unfetter the sculpted hush”), but cadence generally serves the mood. No head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single‑POV lyric voice is steady and confident, with controlled cadence and sensory weighting. Occasional repetition and a minor tense slip (“uncase”) nick polish.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyrical third‑person is steady and consistent with Echo’s fixation and craft. Diction largely fits the voice; the piece maintains clean focalization without leakage. Rhythm is controlled with occasional over‑elevated generalities that skim specificity. The patterned cadence supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is steady and lyrical with consistent distance; diction suits the mythic-liminal register. Rhythmic control is competent, and patterning around vibration/aurora is clear. Some generic constructions (“as if,” “It was as if”) dilute distinctiveness. No head-hopping or stance leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable and lyrical, with consistent diction suited to a mystic’s perception. Rhythm is serviceable but tends toward uniform, elevated phrasing that blurs edges and limits distinctiveness. No dialogue stresses distance control. Voice carries mood but lacks a sharp, idiosyncratic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and diction consistent in a controlled lyric register. Rhythms and repeated constructions create cohesion but also sameness. No dialogue; voice has texture but edges toward purple in places without modulation under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable, diction controlled, and the perceptual signature (craft‑minded, gentle confidence) is consistent. Lyric touches are mostly apt for a contemplative smith. Occasional generic uplift (“sweet scent of success,” “truly remarkable”) flattens edge. No dialogue to test modulation, but narrative stance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable and consistent, but diction is uniform and filter‑heavy. Repetitive stems (“The map maker… she felt… she knew…”) create a drumbeat that undercuts rhythmic control. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond stock lyricism. Clarity is good, but the texture is interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third‑person limited remains steady with a distinct perceptual signature—practical, tactile noticing turned lyrical at edges. Syntax varies well and the cadence supports the meditative drift. No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few phrases recur (“luminescent ache”), flirting with sameness but not breaking control.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent lyric third-person with a steady cadence; diction fits the mystical register. Occasional capitalizations (“Otherworldly routine,” “Accidentally”) and explanatory lines flatten texture. Voice doesn’t deepen under pressure; rhythm stays uniform. No POV leakage, but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond motif repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stable close third with measured, lyrical diction; sensory focus aligns with a meticulous dye master. Rhythm is calm and consistent; no head‑hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    A consistent, lucid third‑person with a lyrical bent; diction and cadence match the magical‑real tone. Rhythm sometimes flattens from repeated declaratives and “In this world” frames. No head‑hopping or stance slips; psychic distance stays steady. Voice is pleasant but could vary sentence music more under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and confident; lyrical cadence is consistent. Diction occasionally slides into generalized uplift and repeats phrasing patterns, reducing distinctiveness. Still, the voice carries the piece’s mood without leakage or confusion. Rhythm could vary more under peak beats to convey pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent close third with calm, even cadence that suits the contemplative mode. Diction is steady and controlled, though sometimes generic and repetitive (“whispers,” “tranquility”).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and diction consistent, with a calm, lyrical register that suits the meditative mode. Perceptual signature is modestly distinct (attention to small shifts and hidden spaces).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third with a lyrical, sensory‑biased diction suits the premise. Rhythm is generally controlled, though recurring stems (“she felt,” “as she”) and abstraction patches flatten peaks. No head‑hopping or register slips. Voice remains coherent and character‑filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is steady and modest; no head‑hopping; diction is consistent. The voice tends toward elevated, occasionally purple phrasing that flattens specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and the diction consistent, with occasional lyric lift that fits the world. The voice is competent but leans generic summary over distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue; rhythm is steady but rarely modulates under stress. Elision is legible but not especially charged.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent third‑person lyrical voice with controlled diction and stable distance. Rhythms are smooth but often uniform, leaning into repetition and abstractions. The voice is competent and legible, yet lacks a distinctive, character‑specific grain under pressure. No dialogue means less opportunity for tonal modulation.

    POV is stable and coherent, but the diction trends generic and abstract at peak beats. Repetitive phrases (“inner static,” “fragmented wholeness”) flatten rhythm and distinctiveness. The voice is serviceable and readable, with occasional strong images, yet lacks a singular perceptual signature. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable and modestly close; diction is clean but generic, with limited perceptual idiosyncrasy. Rhythm is even, sometimes list‑like in recounting events. Dialogue absence avoids leakage but also mutes texture and subtext. The voice carries clarity more than personality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical with controlled focalization and stable distance. Patterned diction and refrain‑like motifs fit the accumulative mode. Some lines circle the same idea, softening edge and momentum. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stable, lyrical third‑person with consistent sensory palette. Cadence can flatten via repeated sentence stems (“The lighter…”), limiting dynamic modulation under pressure. Diction is controlled and apt, though rarely surprising. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyric voice is consistent and confident, but diction occasionally drifts into awkward coinage (“terrestrially cosmic”) and repetition. Psychic distance is stable; no head‑hopping. Rhythm has lulling cadence appropriate to tone but risks monotony. Purposeful compression is clear, with no withholding that harms clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable and unobtrusive; dialogue is sparse but plausible. The narrative voice is serviceable, leaning generic and expository, with little idiosyncratic perception. Rhythm stays even, seldom tightening under peak beats. No head‑hopping or stance slippage, but little tonal modulation beyond “gentle wonder.”

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable and lyrical, with a consistent third-person close texture. Diction trends uniform and occasionally purple, with repeated constructions and favored abstractions that flatten dynamic modulation. No head-hopping or stance errors, but cadence varies too little under pressure. The phrase “through resonance structures” reads as register drift without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third with a controlled, ceremonial lyric register. Rhythm carries a steady hush that suits the sanctuary mood. Repetitive constructions (“As she…”) and occasional purple diction slightly blunt edge and variety. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical third‑person voice is stable and sure‑handed, with consistent sensory bias toward sound. Rhythm holds, and the diction matches the dreamlike register.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable, diction is coherent, and the lyric stance is controlled. The perceptual signature is consistent (ice, light, whispers), though rhythms flatten at times into similar sentence openings and structures. No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge artifacts. Repetition slightly dulls the pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent close third with a calm, lyrical register; diction largely coherent to the contemplative POV. Occasional phrasing feels contrived (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”) and flattens authenticity. Rhythm is even and legible, if somewhat monotone in its cadences. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable and legible, with a consistent third‑person limited stance. Diction is serviceable but leans on stock connectors and repeated stems (“As she…”), with little idiolect specificity to Aria beyond labels.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single, consistent lyrical register with occasional image freshness (“gritty whimsy,” “cobalt glass portico”). The distance is stable, but the voice leans generic and declarative, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. Repetitive stems (“the visionary…”) flatten rhythm. Still, the stance holds coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    A consistent, lyrical close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature (object-focused, sound-attuned) carries the piece. Rhythm varies adequately, though “As…” openings and stacked modifiers recur. No head-hopping or stance slips. The diction suits the character’s sensibility, if occasionally purple.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent close third with a measured, lyric cadence; sensory lexicon suits a sound‑focused engineer. Some diction (“fleshly ethereal,” repeated “ethereal”) leans purple and repetitive, flattening modulation under peak moments. No head‑hopping or stance drift, but rhythmic variety could tighten momentum. Voice is competent but not singularly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single close third is stable; diction remains consistent and suitably restrained. The lyric cadence works but leans on repeated stems (“The mapper knew…,” “She…”) that flatten modulation under pressure. No dialogue; interiority is generalized rather than idiosyncratic. Voice is competent, not yet distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is steady and plausible; the diction is consistent with a reflective, observant protagonist. The voice is competent but leans generic at times (“entangled memories,” “fortified vulnerability”) rather than idiosyncratic. Rhythm is smooth, if somewhat uniform. No dialogue appears, which suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable and modestly close; diction is consistent with a reflective, gentle register.

Rhythmic control is steady but lacks idiosyncratic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is steady and legible, but voice trends generic (“insatiable curiosity,” “living, breathing entity”). Rhythm often repeats “As she…” scaffolds, blunting texture. Lexicon remains consistent with the fable‑lyric mode, if not distinctively character‑bound. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable and modestly close, but the voice trends toward neutral reportage rather than a distinct perceptual signature. Diction is consistent and clean with periodic lyric lift (“echo of forgotten songs”), though cadence can feel uniform. Withholding is minimal; the narrator’s certainty matches the distant summary mode. Absent dialogue, subtext relies on motif rather than voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent close third with a controlled, lyric register. Rhythm is steady and readable, if occasionally uniform. Diction sometimes lapses into generalized abstraction that mutes the perceptual signature. No POV slippage or head‑hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is steady, reflective first person with a consistent perceptual signature (object-detail, weather as feeling). Rhythm modulates from brittle to lulling as solace accrues. Minor diction drift toward abstract summary appears in key sentences, but overall voice remains controlled and character‑specific. No head-hopping or elision debt.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is steady and lyrical; diction is consistent with a contemplative guardian. Rhythm has a pleasing hush, though it trends uniform and can blur momentum. No head‑hopping or stance drift; certainty stays within what the focalizer perceives. Some abstraction (“intersubjective understanding”) jars slightly against the otherwise tactile voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled with consistent focalization. Diction (“whisperfield,” “peripheral awareness”) coheres with the invented world. Some rhythmic sameness and abstract phrasing blunt urgency. Nothing crucial is withheld, but the register can drift toward incantatory repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is steady and legible; diction suits a calm, observant sensibility. Rhythm is even, though repetitive stems (“As she…”) flatten dynamic range. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Voice is competent but not distinct under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical texture; diction matches the contemplative scholar. Rhythm modulates well from stillness to measured resolve. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. A few repeated constructions and elevated terms (“sonically reflective”) brush mannerism but remain coherent to voice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Steady close third with controlled lyric cadence; diction matches the piece’s meditative aims. Repetition is patterned and mostly purposeful, with only slight monotony. The perceptual signature (tactile memory via chalk, attention to fog’s behavior) feels specific. No head-hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single, stable POV with a consistent lyric register. Diction often drifts into abstractions and repeats, limiting the mind’s particularity under stress. Rhythm is smooth but uniform; little modulation during peak pressure. Voice is coherent yet not distinctly character‑bound beyond role labels.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person close remains steady; diction is lyrical and controlled, with rhythmic softness matching the hospice frame. Repetitions (“scent of hope,” “pulsing stillness”) risk sameness and reduce texture. Absence of dialogue fits the hush but limits dynamic modulation. Voice is competent, if not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable and diction consistent; the voice fits a reflective, wonder‑tinted mode. Some phrasing is generic and explanatory, with occasional redundancy. Rhythm is serviceable without notable modulation under pressure. No dialogue to test subtextual control.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is stable and consistent; the lyrical register is even, if generic. The voice lacks a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature—phrasing leans toward abstraction and stock cadences. Still, it’s clear and controlled, with no head‑hopping. Rhythm is steady but could vary more to track emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is steady, lyrical, and suitably contemplative; POV remains stable without leakage. Diction is consistent but leans on recurring adjectives (“soft,” “gentle,” “misty,” “luminescence”), creating monotony. Rhythm rarely sharpens under supposed intensity, so peaks feel similar to the base tempo. No dialogue, appropriately, but the prose could use more textural variation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is steady and appropriate; the lyric voice is consistent and readable. Diction sometimes leans generic in key beats (“new chapter unfolding,” “ready to face whatever came next”). Rhythm is smooth with clean mechanics and no head‑hopping. Silence in place of dialogue is purposeful and fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, maintaining a calm, elevated register. Repetition (“mist swirling,” “swirling hush”) and generalized diction blur a distinct perceptual signature. POV control is steady, but the idiom feels generic for a novelist of this specificity. Cadence lacks modulation at pressure spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    A consistent, lyrical third‑person with steady psychic distance; no leakage or head‑hopping. Rhythm is controlled and suits the quiet build. Diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction (“essence,” “frequency”) but remains legible. The perceptual signature is pleasant if not sharply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close third with a distinct, lyric sensibility; diction matches the mystical register and remains steady. Rhythmic control is generally good, with a contemplative tempo that suits the ritual. Minor repetition (“world held its breath,” “stillness”) flattens modulation at peaks. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    A steady, lyrical third‑person with a craftsman’s bias gives the voice character. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with measured cadences that fit a contemplative mode. Some repetition and generalized abstraction creep in during reflective stretches. No POV slips or register clashes, but pressure doesn’t modulate the voice significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is steady, lyrical, and confident; diction is consistent with a contemplative, mythic register. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping. Some purple lushness and formulaic cadences recur, but rhythm generally suits the mode. Elision is purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stable close third with controlled, lyrical cadence; tactile craft language suits her psyche. Repeated syntactic frames (“As…”) and occasional abstract phrasing slightly flatten rhythm. Diction remains consistent and plausible for the POV. The final cadence is poised and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled under a single POV, with a clear perceptual signature around the wheel’s clicks and the lagoon’s stillness. Some abstraction and repetitive constructions flatten modulation. No dialogue, so pressure rides entirely on narration and image. Distance remains stable and plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable and suitably close; the lyric register is consistent with a reflective, precise observer. Repetitive phrasing (“As she…”) and generalized diction blunt distinctiveness. Moments of engineered noticing land (valves, gauges), but patterned elation smooths over pressure. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lyrical third-person close is stable and suits the meditative mode, with a consistent perceptual signature (time, rhythm, nature). Diction sometimes drifts purple and repeats (“excruciatingly gentle,” “glacial hush”), softening impact. No POV leakage or head-hopping. Rhythm is generally controlled though a touch samey in cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence; sensory focus matches the contemplative mode. Lexicon stays coherent, though repeated signature phrases flatten variation. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm occasionally lulls due to recurrence but remains legible and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stable third-person close with consistent, gently lyric diction suits the meditative mode. Rhythms are even and controlled, if sometimes uniform. No POV leakage or unwarranted certainty. Some repetitive constructions and safe phrasing keep it from a more distinctive signature.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    A stable, lyrical first‑person with controlled diction and rhythmic modulation suits the accumulative design. Perceptual signature—craftsmanship, scent, hush—stays consistent and character‑specific. Occasional abstraction (“geography of healing”) risks register drift but remains anchored by tactile beats. No head‑hopping; stance and tense are steady.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and steady in psychic distance. Diction trends generalized at peaks, with repeated sentence stems (“The prince…”) and abstract nouns. No POV leakage or head‑hopping; stance remains controlled. Rhythm could use more variation to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is steady and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual filter. Diction occasionally leans purple and repeats key phrases, but readability holds. Rhythmic control is competent; no head-hopping. The voice feels polished yet safe, with limited modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    A consistent, gently lyrical third-person voice with controlled distance. Diction is cohesive and avoids register slips; patterned phrasing supports atmosphere. Occasional stock formulations (“defiant hush,” “realistically imaginative”) flatten distinctiveness. Rhythm is steady, if somewhat uniform, through the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent third-person lyric voice with steady diction and rhythm. Repetition creates mood but risks monotony and abstraction. Distance control is stable, though the prose sometimes generalizes instead of embodying perception. No dialogue, and the narrative certainty fits the meditative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third with lyrical restraint; diction fits the character’s contemplative stance. Some generic phrases (“complex and wondrous thing,” “thundering calm”) thin the distinctness. Rhythm is even, if occasionally uniform. No head-hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is steady and legible; the lyric cadence suits the reflective mode. Diction occasionally lapses into generalized phrasing and familiar metaphors, flattening distinctiveness. Rhythm is controlled, if somewhat uniform. No head‑hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    A consistent, lyrical third-person closely held to the gardener; diction (“velveteen gloom,” “shape of intentions”) gives a distinct texture. Rhythm is measured and appropriate to the meditative task. Occasional abstraction/purple edges the line-level but doesn’t disrupt POV modesty or clarity. No dialogue; interior cadence sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable and consistent; the lyric register is steady. Diction trends abstract at times (“groundedly imaginative,” “probability and potentiality”), blurring the character’s perceptual signature. Rhythm is competent but uniform, with similar sentence pulses across beats. No head‑hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    A consistent, lyric third‑person close tracks Emilia’s sensory priorities (sound, light, particulate movement). Rhythm modulates with the broadcast’s intensification and settles into a charged calm at the end. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; elision is purposeful. Recurrent diction approaches sameness at times but serves the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable and serviceable, with modest texture from Lena’s occupational lens. Dialogue is functional but expository, lacking subtextual pressure. Diction sometimes drifts into awkward constructions (“seems to weaves”), flattening voice. Rhythm is even but rarely charged.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent single-POV with a measured, slightly incantatory cadence that fits the character’s intellect. Diction stays stable, with some repetitive stems (“Kael…”), but the perceptual signature is clear. No dialogue to test subtext, but narrative distance is controlled. Minor register stiffness at times, never breaking plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical third-person voice is steady, with controlled rhythm and consistent focalization. Diction fits a contemplative musician in a hushed library. Some phrasing is generic or repetitive, which dulls distinctiveness under pressure. Still, the voice carries the accumulative design without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent, measured close third with a gentle lyrical cadence suited to the material. Some diction repeats (“reverence,” “otherworldly glow”) and generic abstractions flatten peaks. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm holds, if a bit uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV remains steady with clean staging, and dialogue reads natural enough for the scene’s calm tempo. The voice has a gentle lyric texture without head-hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing fits the tone but risks sameness. Distinct idiom between characters is modest but serviceable.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is steady, lyrical, and appropriate to a noticing character; no head-hopping or stance slips. Diction is controlled, if occasionally generic (“latent energy,” “forever changed”). Rhythm is calm and consistent with the piece’s aims. Voice could sharpen with more character-specific idiolect to distinguish Eli beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable and voice is gently lyrical, with consistent diction and rhythm. Distance control is clean; no head‑hopping. Some repetitive constructions and declarative cadence flatten intensity. The lack of dialogue keeps the voice coherent but limits textural variation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable and consistent; the voice has a brooding lyric texture. Rhythm trends uniform and occasionally generic (“as I...,” “I felt...”) with repeated constructions that sap dynamism. Diction sits within a plausible internal register but leans abstract, limiting a distinct perceptual signature under stress. No dialogue to test modulation or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual bias toward light, texture, and quiet. Rhythm is mostly controlled with pleasing cadence shifts at zenith and dawn. Some diction tilts purple and repeats favored constructions, but POV remains stable and credible. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is steady and plausible; diction is consistent with a reflective third‑person close on Elena. The voice is competent if somewhat generic; rhythm is even with few distinctive turns of phrase. Absence of dialogue avoids pitfalls but also limits dynamism and subtextual play.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable and consistent; diction matches the mythic tone. Rhythm sometimes slips into template cadences and relies on repeated constructions (“As he…”, “The clock maker…”) that blunt propulsion. Voice has a unified texture but leans purple and general at peaks. No dialogue to test, which keeps focus but limits tonal modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is stable and readable; the voice achieves a coherent gothic cadence. Repetition of constructions (“The whispering advisor’s voice…”) and elevated diction drift toward purple, flattening rhythm. Few surprises in syntax or lexis; the perceptual signature is serviceable but not distinct. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent lyric third with a distinct perceptual signature—musician’s lexicon, rhythmic sentences. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Some diction loops and intensifiers flatten modulation at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is steady and credible; voice carries a consistent hush and sun‑bleached tension. Diction is serviceable but leans on repetitive stems (“Lyra felt…,” “She…”) that flatten rhythm under pressure. No head‑hopping or register drift. A touch more syntactic variety and character‑particular noticing would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is steady and legible, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction suited to a historian. Rhythm is uniform and occasionally repetitive, but readable. No head‑hopping or stance slips. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature under pressure, leaning on generalized formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable and consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence. Diction trends toward cliché (“hushed blaze,” “beacon in the void”), and patterning repeats (“As the surveyor...”), dulling distinctiveness. The professional lens surfaces lightly but could deepen voice specificity. Rhythm is even, with limited modulation under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent close third with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits the contemplative mode. Repeated constructions (“Elara felt…”) and lexical recycling dull edges. Voice remains coherent and legible with steady rhythm, if a bit uniform. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Consistent close third with a lyrical, image-forward register suited to the piece; no head-hopping or stance slips. Diction reflects a maker’s sensibility and maintains coherence. Some purple edging and repetition appear, but rhythm remains controlled. The voice modulates into a softer cadence at closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable and clear; narrative certainty stays within Amira’s experience. Diction sometimes drifts into abstract or academic register (“dynamics of complex systems,” “perturbation theory”) without full voice integration. The rhythm is serviceable but not distinctive; dialogue is minimal and functional. Under pressure, the voice defaults to summary over textured perception.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable and diction consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative mode. Some phrasing trends generic/lofty, but not to the point of voice drift. Rhythm holds and images recur with intent (“brilliant dimness,” wind, hum). No dialogue avoids pitfalls but also limits dynamic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    A controlled, consistent lyrical POV with a distinct lexicon (“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”) and measured cadence. Occasional repetition and abstraction slightly blur urgency but not stance. No head‑hopping; focalization stays tight to her sensibility. Rhythm supports the quiet accumulation and closing poise.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stable close third with a consistent, hushed lyric texture; the single spoken line matches the register. Diction fits the contemplative mode, and stance control is steady. Some phrasing trends generic (“weight,” “path to forgiveness”), but cadence is clean and confident. No head-hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable and consistent; narrative certainty matches Jack’s perspective. Voice is clear but plain, with repetitive diction (“align,” “gravitate,” “flicker”) creating a uniform cadence. Limited modulation under stress; few idiosyncratic perceptions. Competent but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is consistent and legible; diction maintains a unified, slightly lyrical register. Repetition patterns (“As she…,” “Lena…”) and similar clause structures flatten rhythm. Voice conveys mood but lacks idiosyncratic specificity and modulation under stress. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third‑person lyrical voice is steady and appropriate to the fable‑like mode; focalization stays consistent with Lyra. Diction occasionally leans generic mystical (“cosmic intimacy,” “otherworldly”) which blunts distinctiveness. Rhythm carries momentum through the ritual without confusion. No dialogue appears, avoiding potential slips but limiting tonal variety.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third‑person close remains steady with a consistent, moony lyric register suited to the material. Some syntactic repetition (“The cartomancer…”) flattens rhythmic variety. Diction matches the character’s contemplative stance without register slips. Overall strong but not singularly distinctive under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is steady and confident in a close third with a lyrical register that suits the meditative mode. Diction is cohesive; patterning (stitching, glimmer, weight) is controlled. Minor repetition and abstraction creep in at peaks, but clarity holds. Rhythm is generally well‑modulated for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lyric third‑person voice is stable and legible, with a consistent sensory palette. Diction sometimes drifts into generalities (“texture of transformation,” “complex web of connections”), which blunts character-specific perception. Minimal dialogue is serviceable but not texturally distinct. Rhythm holds but rarely surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and legible; the elevated, hushed diction is consistent. However, purple phrasing and repeated constructions create sameness of rhythm and dilute pressure. The voice seldom sharpens under stress, maintaining a floaty register during pivotal beats. No dialogue to test distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    A consistent, lyrical third‑person close holds steady and suits the meditative mode. Diction is controlled if occasionally generalized; no POV leakage. Rhythm is even, though it risks sameness during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Consistent close third with a distinct, lyrical cadence suited to the piece. Diction is largely controlled and character‑specific, with rhythm modulating at the inspiration/reading turn. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Slight purple tendencies appear but don’t break control.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and consistent, with a measured, elevated register that suits the premise. Diction occasionally lapses into generalized grandeur and repetition, reducing distinctiveness. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Rhythm is serviceable but rarely surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable and lyrical with a distinct texture; diction is mostly controlled. Some clichés and repeated constructions (“beacon,” “phoenix,” reiterated resolve) flatten the voice in high beats. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. The rhythm suits the contemplative mode but rarely sharpens at moments that should bite.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.7)
    Consistent, lyrical third-person with a coherent perceptual signature; diction suits the elegiac mode. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, with sustained control through the portal sequence and return. Some generic phrasing intrudes near the end, slightly flattening the otherwise distinct voice. No head‑hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fable‑like mode. Diction occasionally lapses into generic lyricism and repetitive constructions, softening distinctiveness. The perceptual signature is serviceable but rarely surprising. Control is steady, if somewhat uniform in rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single‑POV lyric voice is consistent, calm, and well‑modulated to the character’s temperament. Diction is controlled, though the register occasionally edges toward generic solemnity. Absence of dialogue is appropriate; the narrative cadence supports the contemplative mode. Minor sameness in sentence shape tempers distinctiveness.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    Point of view is stable and technically proficient, but the narrative voice is a monotonous, academic register that feels disconnected from the physical reality of the scene. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, making Maria's voice sound generic and authorial rather than specific and personal. While consistent, the voice creates a significant emotional distance and fails to modulate in response to the environment or her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, maintaining a steady psychic distance. The voice is lyrical and fits the contemplative tone, but it lacks a distinct, character-particular signature, reading more like a generic literary narrator than the specific inner world of a glass artist. While competent, the prose lacks the unique perceptual filter that would elevate the character's voice from proficient to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its slightly formal, descriptive tone. The prose is clean and controlled throughout, effectively maintaining the serene, contemplative mood. The voice, however, lacks a distinctive perceptual signature or memorable rhythm, reading as competent and literary but not uniquely character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the somber, almost mythic voice is consistent with the story's tone. However, the psychic distance remains consistently large, creating a detached, report-like quality that keeps the reader from experiencing the events with immediacy. We observe the undertaker's journey more than we inhabit it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice is more functional than distinctive, relying on somewhat generic, elevated prose and familiar emotional phrasing ("beacon of hope," "heart full of hope"). It lacks a particular perceptual signature that would make Akira's internal world feel unique and textured, especially under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the lyrical voice aligns with the story's mystical tone. Psychic distance is managed well, keeping us close to Aria's internal experience. The primary weakness is that the dialogue is reported rather than shown, flattening the pivotal interaction with the pilgrim and reducing its immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is generic and overly formal, laden with academic and philosophical jargon ("hyperbolic geometry," "metaphysical odyssey"). This creates a detached, explanatory tone that distances the reader from Elian's experience. The voice lacks a unique perceptual signature, reading more like an omniscient treatise on the story's concepts than a character's internal world.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.8)
    The third-person POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic, distant, and overly formal, reading like a historical summary or a myth. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the prose tells us *about* the liberator's thoughts in cliché terms rather than inhabiting their perspective. This psychic distance prevents any sense of immediacy or personal investment in the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for the story's introspective nature. The perceptual signature of hearing colors is a strong concept that enriches the world. While consistently applied, it functions more as a descriptive layer than a perspective that fundamentally alters her tactics or choices in a way that carries a specific cost or provides a unique solution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance from Lumina. The voice, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading more like a generic lyrical narrator than a specific character's internal world. The prose aims for an elevated, mysterious tone but frequently uses common phrasings ("fabric of reality," "heart of existence"), which flattens the voice's uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the lyrical voice supports the contemplative mood. However, the voice isn't particularly distinct, occasionally leaning on generic phrasing. The introduction of Elian "dramatically narrating their mundane tasks" feels like an unintegrated affectation rather than a core part of their perceptual signature or the narrative's structure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    The first-person POV is consistent, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on generic emotional phrasing and a uniform sentence structure. An overuse of filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized") distances the reader from the immediate experience. The prose is clear but functional, failing to modulate its rhythm or texture to reflect the character's internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical quality appropriate for the subject matter. Psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on the oracle’s experience. The voice is strong, but its effectiveness is hampered by repetitive prose patterns, which slightly dull the specificity of the character's perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinctive texture or character-specific perceptual signature. The prose is clean but has a formal, slightly distant quality that feels more authorial than authentically rooted in the consciousness of a robot janitor. The voice serves to explain concepts clearly but does not create a memorable or immersive internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generalized, elevated narrator than the specific internal world of a "quiet night registrar." The prose is controlled, but its uniformity prevents the voice from modulating effectively with the character's internal shifts, remaining at the same poetic distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The voice is lyrical and tonally appropriate for a fable-like narrative. However, the psychic distance remains consistently far, observing the dresser with a detached reverence that prevents a more intimate or character-particular perceptual signature from emerging. The prose reflects the story's mood more than the specific mind of the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice is weakened by a heavy reliance on filter verbs ("Kaelin felt," "Kaelin knew") that create psychic distance. This robs key moments of immediacy. While the prose has a distinct, descriptive texture, it often reports on Kaelin's experience rather than immersing the reader within it.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently. However, the narrative voice is generic and relies heavily on filter verbs ("Rachel felt," "she noticed," "she pondered"), which creates distance and dulls immediacy. The prose describes Rachel's experience rather than inhabiting it, lacking a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the voice from functional to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is consistent, and the narrative voice has a distinct, elevated texture. The prose is controlled and maintains a formal, melancholic tone throughout. The primary weakness is that the voice lacks a character-specific perceptual signature; it reads more like a dispassionate, academic narrator's voice than the internal experience of a specific individual, which creates a significant distance from Aria's supposed journey.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, reflective distance. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic constructions and filter verbs ("they felt a sense of," "they couldn't shake the feeling"). The voice is functional but does not possess the unique texture or rhythm that would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person POV is stable, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, stately, and melancholic tone that suits the material. The psychic distance is well-controlled. The primary weakness is a lack of syntactic variety, where similar sentence structures create a somewhat monotonous rhythm that borders on incantatory but occasionally slips into flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice maintains a stable, gentle tone appropriate for the character. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to generic descriptions ("eyes wide with wonder") and a slightly sentimental register. While functional, the prose lacks the unique texture and rhythmic control that would elevate it to a higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is tonally consistent with the story's contemplative mood. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Emilia's perceptions. However, the voice is weakened by repetitive sentence structures, particularly the frequent use of "As she..." clauses to begin paragraphs, which creates a monotonous rhythm that undermines the otherwise lyrical prose.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the point of view is consistent, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature and falls into a monotonous rhythm. The prose relies on repetitive sentence structures, particularly the "The Oracle [verb]..." template, which creates a plodding, mechanical cadence. This uniformity undermines the intended tone of a "familiar enigma" by making the voice feel generic rather than uniquely cryptic.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a distinct, elevated, and poetic tone that suits the subject matter. Psychic distance is stable. However, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, sometimes slipping into generalized, abstract spiritual language ("plumb the depths of the human soul") rather than filtering the experience through a specific, individual consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice maintains a consistent, lyrical, and elevated tone that matches the story's atmospheric goals. The psychic distance is stable and the perceptual signature is clear, focusing on light, form, and memory. The primary weakness is a tendency towards narrative over-explanation, often telling the reader the significance of a feeling or object rather than allowing it to emerge from the character's unfiltered perception, which keeps the voice from achieving true immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is elevated and formal in a way that feels like stock epic fantasy, using abstract, high-register language ("periodically eternal existence," "labyrinthine corridors") that distances the reader from any concrete experience. While consistent, the voice is a vessel for delivering concepts rather than embodying a unique consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, and the lyrical voice is well-suited to the story's meditative tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly particular perceptual signature; the voice feels more like a gentle, omniscient narrator describing a feeling than a deep immersion into this specific character's unique way of perceiving the world through vibration and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading as generic and overly formal. The prose frequently relies on filter verbs and abstractions to convey the character's internal state ("she felt a shiver," "a sense of clarity washed over her"), creating distance instead of immediacy. The clunky, authorial phrasing in "the storm recorder's credibly curious nature" is a notable slip that breaks the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. The narrative voice maintains a wistful, contemplative tone appropriate for the story. However, it relies on filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "knew") that create distance and report on emotions rather than immersing the reader in them. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on a competent but generic literary style that doesn't feel uniquely Elara's.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, philosophical tone. However, the voice is undermined by the repetitive use of key phrases ("passionate subtlety," "texture of time"), which become authorial tics rather than authentic elements of the character's perceptual signature. This repetition creates a monotonous rhythm that flattens the voice's potential for modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the voice has a distinct lyrical and elevated tone. However, the narrative voice at times feels separate from the character's plausible internal experience, reading more like an omniscient narrator's description than the character's own filtered perception. The prose is controlled, but the perceptual signature isn't uniquely tied to the character's stated traits.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that perfectly matches the story's tone. The psychic distance is consistent and effective. The prose lacks some rhythmic variety, occasionally settling into a uniform cadence, but the overall control of voice is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently without any technical errors like head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythm. It employs abstract emotional labels ("cautious exuberance") instead of embodying them in the prose, resulting in a competent but forgettable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, fable-like tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on recurring, abstract phrases ("webs of kinship," "luminescent ache") that feel more like authorial labels than a character's specific way of seeing the world. The prose often describes feeling rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a fittingly lyrical and mysterious quality. The prose captures a sense of wonder. The narrative voice, however, occasionally slips into generic descriptions of internal states, and lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it from proficient to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It relies on a formal, somewhat generic literary register and an overabundance of abstract psychological jargon ("ambiguous loss," "buried optimism," "morbid fascination"). The voice serves to explain the character's state rather than embody it, creating a sense of detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a gentle, lyrical quality. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic phrasing ("eyes lit up," "heart full"). While functional, it does not achieve the kind of specific, character-inflected texture required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.4)
    The point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone. However, the voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic authorial meditation than the specific internal world of a nursery owner. Repetitive sentence structures and a reliance on abstract nouns ("metamorphosis," "transformation," "renewal") flatten the prose and distance the reader from Emilia's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    The first-person POV is consistent, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The narration is functional and clear but relies on a generic, reflective tone rather than a unique way of seeing and processing the world. The prose often describes emotions with stock phrasing ("couldn't help but feel," "a sense of ... wash over me") instead of embedding them in a character-specific voice or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative voice has a distinct, if somewhat conventional, mystical tone. The prose creates a specific texture that suits the subject matter. However, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally relying on familiar fantasy phrasing ("eyes that shone like the stars on a clear night") rather than forging a more particular and memorable perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somewhat formal, reflective tone throughout. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would separate it from a generic literary narrator. It describes the archivist's feelings and thoughts competently but rarely feels as if the reader is experiencing the world through her unique, biased perspective, especially under pressure which never truly materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on filter verbs ("Emilia felt") and abstract emotional labels. This creates a psychic distance that reports on her experience rather than immersing the reader within it. The prose is functional but generic, failing to capture the unique worldview of an "analytically artistic" individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Point of view is stable and third-person limited, with a consistent, elevated tone. The narrative voice, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a generic literary narrator than the specific interiority of a "sympathetic skeptic." The psychic distance remains large, summarizing Emilia's feelings with abstract nouns rather than grounding the reader in her direct, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent and well-suited to an ancient, reflective being. While the prose style is not radically distinctive, its control over tone and psychic distance is highly effective. The single line of dialogue is impactful and perfectly pitched for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. While the prose is clear, it relies on some generic phrasing ("surge of determination," "morbid beauty") that prevents the voice from feeling unique to this character and this world. It is proficient but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is a stable and controlled limited third person, and the voice is lyrical and consistent, perfectly matching the story's contemplative tone. The prose has a distinct, elegant texture created by purposeful word choices ("gilded-leaf," "incandescent"). While highly effective, the voice lacks a uniquely sharp perceptual signature that would distinguish it as exceptional, reading more as a beautiful "literary" mode rather than a deeply idiosyncratic perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.5)
    Point of view is stable and third-person limited, but the voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose feels detached and philosophical, which suits the tone but fails to create a specific character. The narrative distance is consistent but so great that it prevents any sense of immediacy or personal investment in the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, mystical tone appropriate for the material. However, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally relying on generalized fantastical phrasing like "the very fabric of time was bending." While functional, the voice doesn't feel unique to this specific character's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    The third-person POV is maintained, but the narrative voice is distant and declarative, resembling a historical account. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the voice lacks the texture, rhythm, and specific bias of a character's internal experience. The prose consistently summarizes emotions and motivations instead of filtering events through a subjective lens, resulting in a flat, impersonal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance. The voice aims for a lyrical, melancholic quality. However, it suffers from repetitive sentence structures and recycled phrasing ("a poignant reminder of," "a dawning hush"), creating a monotonous cadence that feels more like a template than a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, calm tone. The prose attempts to filter perception through a blind character's senses, focusing on touch and sound. However, there are moments where the narration relies on visual language ("miniature rainbow," "light danced") that feel slightly misaligned with the character's direct experience, bridged by the somewhat abstract phrase "watched...with her entire being."

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It feels more like a generic literary narrator than the specific voice of a "dry-witted atlas editor." The prose is marred by repetitive sentence structures, particularly the overuse of "As she..." clauses, which creates a monotonous rhythm and flattens the voice during moments of rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, slightly distant and formal voice that befits the "cryptic" character. The prose's deliberate, metronomic rhythm effectively mirrors the tuner's footsteps and the story's central action. The perceptual signature is consistent, focused entirely on sound, vibration, and the atmospheric state of the town, creating a cohesive and purposeful narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to generic phrasing and emotional summary. The prose has a uniform rhythm that doesn't modulate significantly with the rising tension, creating a somewhat detached feel that keeps the reader at a distance from Kael's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained with a controlled, literary voice. Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual signature aligns with a character attuned to legacy and secrets. The prose has a distinct texture, but it suffers from a somewhat uniform rhythm and repetitive sentence structures that slightly blunt its overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    The lyrical, descriptive voice is consistent and well-suited to the tone. However, the point of view is unsteady, frequently slipping from the alchemist's limited perspective into an omniscient narration that explains the ghost's history and motivations. This tendency to explain undermines narrative tension by removing mystery the focal character should be experiencing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a coherent, lyrical tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on a repeating lexicon of abstract, poetic words ("solace," "reverence," "ethereal"). This creates a somewhat generic and monotonous texture that serves the mood but fails to render a unique character mind.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and relies heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she found herself"). This creates a psychic distance that reports on Maya's experience rather than immersing the reader in it. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a calm summary than a specific character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.5)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice feels more authorial and academic than personal to the character. The prose texture, with its elevated diction ("anachronism," "juxtapose"), creates a consistent but distant tone. It lacks a specific perceptual signature that would distinguish Cipher's internal experience from a detached description of it.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent psychic distance, and the voice aligns well with the story's elevated, mystical tone. The prose has a distinct, if somewhat uniform, texture. The primary flaw is a lack of syntactic variety and a reliance on repetitive sentence structures (e.g., "The embroiderer's..."), which creates a monotonous rhythm and prevents the voice from developing a truly unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical, and elevated tone appropriate for the mystical subject matter. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the lush setting through Aria's senses and priorities. While effective, the voice occasionally leans on a slightly uniform, solemn rhythm that could benefit from more variation to heighten moments of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent in tone. However, the voice feels more authorial than character-specific, employing a polished, elevated diction ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The prose signature belongs to the writer, not the translator in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a fittingly lyrical and atmospheric quality. The prose is clean and controlled. However, it occasionally slips into cliché ("the veil between reality and dreams seemed to be at its thinnest"), preventing the voice from achieving a truly distinct or memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a lyrical and slightly magical tone. The narrative voice modulates effectively with the rising intensity of the climax. While the prose is strong, the perceptual signature, while fitting, lacks a truly idiosyncratic quality that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and overly expository. It functions more like a historical summary than a close psychic viewpoint, telling us about Lyra and her world instead of filtering the experience through her unique "rogue scholar" perspective. The prose lacks a distinct rhythm or perceptual signature, reading as a functional but impersonal description of events.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the subject. POV control is flawless, keeping the focus tightly on the poet's internal state. While the prose has a distinct texture, some of the more unique phrases ("blossom armistice," "reef-shadow joy") feel slightly imposed, lacking the full integration that would create a truly idiosyncratic and unforgettable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's lyrical, melancholic tone. The prose has a deliberate, gentle rhythm that matches the caretaker's actions. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes relying on generalized poetic phrasing ("seemed to be crafted," "seemed to hold") that keeps the reader at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice maintains a lyrical, arcane tone appropriate for the genre. While the prose is controlled, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on standard phrasing for a scholarly fantasy character. It is functional and effective but doesn't achieve a memorable or unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice has a uniform, somewhat mannered texture. The prose relies on a repeating lexicon of affective words ("tremble," "warmth," "resolve") and filtering phrases ("Kaelin felt," "Kaelin knew"), which creates psychic distance. This results in a voice that describes an emotional state rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that aligns well with the story’s reflective mood. The psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Emilia’s internal state. The main weakness is that the interiority sometimes becomes too explanatory, articulating her psychological processes with a clarity that feels more like authorial summary than a character’s lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    The first-person POV is consistent, and the lyrical, reflective voice aligns with the story's dreamlike tone. The prose maintains a stable psychic distance. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling like a generalized "poetic" narrator rather than a specific child's perspective, which keeps it from achieving a higher level of distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person POV is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The heavy repetition of specific, unusual phrases ("softly ingenious," "shadowseam wonder") makes the voice feel more like an artifact of a writing prompt than an organic expression of the character's consciousness, undermining its authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and otherworldly tone throughout. The prose has a distinct, if sometimes overwrought, texture. However, the voice feels more attached to the concept than to a specific, idiosyncratic character; it reads as a generic "mythic narrator" voice rather than the particular perceptual signature of this individual recollectionist.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice has a formal, analytical quality that aligns with the character concept. However, the narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling more authorial and expository than filtered through a specific character's mind. The prose is clean but lacks the unique texture that would elevate the voice from competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece maintains a consistent and evocative voice, with a lyrical and elevated tone that suits the subject matter. The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on sensory details and cosmic imagery. The prose rhythm and word choice ("cabochon," "obsidian grace") create a specific texture that successfully carries the narrative's mystical quality without any slips in control or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the third-person limited POV is technically stable, the narrative voice feels more authorial than personal. The elevated, philosophical diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "clear complexity") is consistent but creates a distance, making the glazier feel less like a specific person and more like a vessel for an essayistic idea. A more distinct perceptual signature, rooted in the specific senses of a glazier, is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently without slips. The narrative voice maintains a stable, literary tone. However, the prose has a generic quality, with elevated, poetic phrasing ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "velvet expanse") that feels disconnected from the grounded perspective of a scarred forest firefighter, creating a register mismatch between character and narration.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, if somewhat formal, tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on filter verbs ("Aria felt," "she saw," "she knew") that create distance. The prose is clean and controlled but doesn't fully inhabit Aria's unique perspective as a "logical dreamer," reading more like a dispassionate observation of her experience than the experience itself.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Point of view is stable and third-person limited is maintained without error. However, the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond a melancholic tone. Its texture is weakened by the constant repetition of key phrases ("ivy-veiled passage," "legacy's burden"), which makes the prose feel mechanical and diminishes the voice's authority and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person POV is stable and the elevated, lyrical voice is tonally appropriate for the subject matter. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on familiar genre phrasing ("essence of the atmosphere," "veil of reality"). Significant repetition of key phrases and sentence structures flattens the voice and prevents it from feeling unique or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic, overly formal, and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a detached, analytical quality, describing Elian's state with abstract terminology ("ritual significance," "tangible representation") that creates distance and feels inauthentic to a character in a moment of exhausted triumph. The voice does not modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a controlled, somber tone appropriate for the scene. The narrative distance remains stable and fits the reserved nature of the character. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on generic phrasing rather than a unique way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently with a controlled, lyrical tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to the specific character of a "chaste courtesan." The prose feels more like a generic elevated narrator than an intimate reflection of a particular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into generic phrasing ("creative juices stirring," "deep well of creativity"). While the prose is clean, it doesn't fully embody the specified "urbane" trait, resulting in a voice that feels competent but not particularly memorable or character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent lyrical distance and tone. The voice is controlled and fits the meditative subject matter. However, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes leaning on familiar phrasing for natural imagery ("sweet scent of blooming flowers"), which prevents it from achieving a higher level of distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally feeling like a generic "mystical artisan" voice. Interiority is often filtered through summary ("Akira felt a deep sense of satisfaction") rather than embodied in specific, character-particular perception, creating distance from her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, elevated psychic distance. The voice is coherent with the ethereal tone, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual language ("intricate web of causality," "complex dance of understood events"). This results in a voice that feels more generic and philosophical than personal and unique.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is stable and the elevated, lyrical voice is consistent throughout, fitting the story's mythic tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a grand, omniscient narration than the specific viewpoint of an "empirically ironic" individual. The prose serves the atmosphere well but does little to deepen character, feeling more authorial than focalized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical consistency, and the narrative distance is stable. However, the voice is generic and abstract, lacking a distinctive perceptual signature rooted in character. The prose is clean but has a uniform, formal rhythm that feels more like a philosophical fable than the perspective of a specific individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the lyrical, fairy-tale voice is maintained effectively throughout. The tone is controlled and fits the material well. The primary weakness is that the voice, while pleasant, lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; it feels more like a generic mythic narrator than a specific character's filtered consciousness. The prose describes her world poetically but rarely reveals a unique, idiosyncratic way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Elara's thoughts often sound more like the author's thematic statements than the internal monologue of a specific character. Phrases like "The contract...had been deciduous in nature" create a formal, fable-like tone that maintains distance from the character's immediate, embodied experience, reading as polished summary rather than raw interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative relies heavily on filter verbs and constructions ("The curator felt," "The curator knew"), creating distance and a somewhat generic, reportorial tone that mutes the immediacy of the surreal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is functional and clear but reads more like a formal report of events than a lived, subjective experience. This dispassionate distance keeps the reader from fully inhabiting Elara's perspective during moments of supposed excitement or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose relies on conventional genre vocabulary ("forsaken vessel," "otherworldly light") that creates a functional but generic mystical tone, rather than a voice unique to this specific character and her "aberrant" mind.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and overly abstract, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. Emilia's internal state is described with conceptual jargon ("clear complexity emerging") rather than embodied, specific feeling. The professor's dialogue is purely functional, delivering exposition without individual cadence or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is tonally consistent with the lyrical, ethereal subject matter. The prose maintains a controlled, formal distance that suits the fable-like quality of the story. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would make the mapkeeper's experience feel specific and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. An over-reliance on filter verbs ("felt," "realized") creates psychic distance and dulls immediacy. While the tone is maintained, the prose does not feel uniquely filtered through this specific custodian's mind, reading more like a detached, mythic recounting than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the lyrical, elevated voice is sustained throughout. The narrative distance is appropriate for the reflective tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature; while elegant, its patterns of observation and syntax could belong to many sensitive, thoughtful protagonists, making it feel more like a well-executed archetype than a singular character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative tone. However, the prose relies on abstract phrases like "ambient awareness" and "defy the gravity of hopelessness," which feel more like conceptual labels than a character-specific perceptual signature. The voice is pleasant but lacks the distinctiveness and rhythmic control under pressure that would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical competence, and the narrative voice is consistent in its formal, meditative tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic "wise observer" archetype than a specific individual's perspective. While there are no technical errors like head-hopping, the prose fails to create a unique and memorable narrative consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a coherent, fairy-tale quality. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling more like a detached, omniscient narrator than a close psychic rendering of a child's experience. The prose is clean but lacks the particularity and texture that would elevate it to a truly memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent, and its elevated, lyrical tone is effective in establishing the story's serene mood. The prose rhythm mirrors the character's calm demeanor. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, relying on abstract descriptions and told attributes ("fluidly logical") rather than a unique way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently with a stable, elevated tone. The voice is fitting for a mythic tale but lacks a distinctive perceptual signature; Aria's way of seeing the world feels somewhat generic for an archetypal hero. The prose is clear and controlled, but it doesn't modulate significantly with pressure or reveal a unique inner life through its rhythm or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative distance is stable. The voice has a consistent lyrical, somber tone. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often relying on familiar "poetic" archetypes ("skeletal hand," "slumbering giant") rather than a character-particular way of seeing the world, which keeps the voice from feeling truly unique.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is technically stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct character-specific texture. Awkward, self-consciously literary phrases such as "shadowseam wonder" feel imposed by the author rather than arising from Lyra's perspective, creating an inconsistent and unconvincing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, elevated psychic distance appropriate for a fable-like narrative. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on generic, abstract descriptions ("otherworldly energy," "symphony of insight") rather than character-specific sensory details. The prose reads more like a myth being recounted than an experience being lived.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The elevated, formal voice is maintained consistently, fitting the fantastical tone. The point of view is stable, with psychic distance modulating appropriately as the mystical event intensifies. The prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, however, reading more as a competent genre voice than a unique character's internal world.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is functional but leans on generic literary phrasing ("labyrinth of forgotten stories," "tapestry of unknown histories," "sanctuary of remembrance"). The voice describes Emilia's emotional journey with a certain distance, rarely sinking into the specific, idiosyncratic texture of her thoughts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person POV is stable, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone. However, the voice feels more authorial than character-driven, lacking a distinct perceptual signature for Aria. Frequent use of filter verbs ("Aria felt," "Aria knew") creates distance, and the prose articulates her mission with a clarity that feels external rather than like an internal experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent lyrical voice and psychic distance. The prose has a distinct, atmospheric texture. The primary weakness is that the voice sometimes feels more authorial than character-bound, using elevated, abstract descriptors ("vested hush," "eerie nostalgia") that read like labels for a mood rather than the character's specific, in-the-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.5)
    The lyrical voice is consistent in its tone and vocabulary, creating a distinct, if monotonous, texture. However, the point of view is significantly weakened by an over-reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew"). This technique creates a narrative distance that consistently summarizes the character's experience rather than allowing the reader to live it directly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to a generic, slightly elevated register. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs and emotional summary ("Elian felt," "Elian realized"), which creates distance and dampens immediacy. While technically clean, the voice doesn't feel specific to this particular tinkerer's mind, especially under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice is overly formal and abstract, creating a psychic distance that keeps the reader from experiencing Elara's journey viscerally. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like an academic summary of a character's journey than a lived-in experience from a unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Point of view is stable and third-person limited, with no technical errors. However, the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a somewhat elevated, formal tone that remains consistent but fails to create a memorable or character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.1)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice feels artificial and imposed. The diction frequently shifts into a high-concept, academic register that seems inconsistent with a character experiencing raw trauma responses. This creates a distance from Elara's experience, making her voice feel less like a distinct individual's and more like a vehicle for the author's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice maintains a fittingly lyrical and mystical tone. The prose is clean and controlled. The primary minor weakness is a reliance on repetitive sentence structures ("As she...", "It was in...") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") that slightly reduce the prose's dynamism and immediacy, creating a somewhat uniform rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the story's reflective tone. The narrative voice is consistent and clear. It lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic inventiveness that would elevate it to the highest tier, sometimes leaning on familiar phrasing ("testament to a bygone era," "skeletal fingers").

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person POV is controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that supports the operator's enigmatic nature. The narrative voice is distinct, with an elevated, lyrical prose style that establishes and sustains the story's ethereal, mythic tone. The perceptual signature is clear, focused on light, patterns, and sounds that are relevant to the operator's work. The execution is stable and effective for the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the melancholic, literary tone. The third-person limited POV maintains a stable psychic distance, filtering the evocative setting through the character's specific, "poetically inclined" perceptions. The prose has a unique texture and rhythm that effectively supports the story's introspective mood.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, lyrical tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The third-person limited POV is handled cleanly, keeping the focus on Erebus's meticulous process and internal purpose. The prose has a distinct, magical texture, though its reliance on grand, abstract phrasing at times makes the voice feel slightly impersonal rather than deeply rooted in a specific character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a controlled, literary quality. However, the perceptual signature is generic for the genre, lacking idiosyncratic detail that would make the voice memorable. The prose is clean and functional but does not achieve a truly distinct texture reflecting this specific character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice feels more authorial than character-driven. The prose is marked by an elevated, academic register ("scaffold complexity," "turbine-hum reverie") that feels inauthentic for a driftwood sculptor in a moment of inspiration. This register mismatch creates a distance from the character's experience, making the voice feel generic and imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and contemplative tone appropriate for the story's aims. The perceptual signature is clear, focused on light, shadow, and natural imagery. However, the voice lacks modulation; it remains at a single, dreamy pitch throughout, which, combined with the lack of conflict, creates a monotonous texture.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice maintains a solemn, literary tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often leaning on generic phrasing ("breathtaking vista," "strange and wondrous place") that keeps the reader at a distance. The narrative voice reports on Naomi's feelings rather than fully inhabiting her perspective, resulting in a narrative that feels more observed than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a stable, formal tone appropriate for a fable-like story. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the alchemist's way of seeing the world feels generic and filtered through the story's thematic aims. While technically competent, the prose doesn't create a unique or memorable narrative consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The formal, elevated voice is consistent and appropriate for a "venerable oath scribe," and the third-person limited POV is maintained without error. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading as somewhat generic and distant. This keeps the reader at arm's length from the scribe's internal experience during the story's most critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Point of view is stable and psychic distance is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly detached tone appropriate for the material. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on generalized descriptions of transcendent experience ("sensation unlike any other," "kaleidoscope of images"). It reads as a competent but impersonal fable narrator rather than a voice uniquely filtered through this specific character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistently lyrical, fitting the story's gentle tone. Psychic distance is well-controlled for a quiet, reflective piece. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; its lyrical quality feels somewhat generic and could belong to many sensitive protagonists. The prose is clean and controlled, but doesn't achieve a memorable or unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the third-person limited POV is stable, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The diction feels overly writerly and generic ("celestial ballet," "velvet expanse"), reading more like an author's philosophical musings than the specific internal world of a janitor. This register mismatch creates a distance that prevents the voice from feeling authentic to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice feels more authorial and ornamental than rooted in a specific character's perception. The prose has a consistent, elevated tone, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would separate this recluse's way of seeing from a generic poetic narrator. The language, while often beautiful, creates a psychic distance that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the voice is stable, maintaining a somewhat formal, detached tone that suits a "timekeeper." Psychic distance is controlled. However, the voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature; the world is described cleanly but not through a particularly unique or biased lens, which makes the prose feel more descriptive than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view and narrative distance are stable, maintaining a consistent, lyrical voice. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a generic "poetic" register. The prose has texture, but its rhythmic patterns and word choices become predictable, preventing the voice from feeling unique to this specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, calm tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or memorable texture. Its placid, reportorial quality remains unchanged even when confronting mortality, making it feel more like a dispassionate narrative filter than the authentic interiority of a specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice maintains a stable, elevated register. However, the voice feels more generic than character-particular, relying on an academic lexicon that describes the character's state rather than inhabiting it. The prose has a distinct rhythm, but it doesn't modulate enough under pressure, creating a sense of detached observation even in moments of supposed anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like tone that suits the material. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the observations feel more authorial and generic than filtered through the specific consciousness of this unique character. The prose serves the tone but does not embody a particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.9)
    The point of view is unstable, shifting between Lyra's and Kael's perspectives without clear motivation or control ("Kael felt an inexplicable tug," "Lyra sat by a fire, puzzling"). This head-hopping creates a psychic distance and prevents deep immersion in a single, consistent consciousness. The narrative voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythm, reading more like a generic story summary than a unique character's experience of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is functional and clear, but relies on somewhat standard phrasing ("testament to the transience of human endeavor," "insatiable urge") that keeps it from feeling truly individual or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with competence and consistency. The narrative voice has a fittingly formal, mythic quality. However, the prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("wonder," "uncertainty," "harmony") and filter-like emotional summary ("feeling a sense of pride," "heart swelled with a sense of wonder") which keeps the reader at a distance rather than immersed in a specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, measured, and slightly ethereal tone. However, the narrative voice is more that of a fable-teller than a distinct perspective rooted in a character. It relies on high-concept, abstract phrases ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") that feel imposed rather than emerging from a specific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that suits the mystical subject matter. Psychic distance is stable, and the focalization is controlled. The voice effectively carries the story's tone and atmosphere, with no unmotivated shifts or technical errors that disrupt the reader's immersion. The prose's tendency toward overwriting is a line-level issue (Q7) rather than a flaw in the voice's core consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the voice is consistent in its slightly elevated, somber tone. There is no head-hopping or psychic distance drift. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the prose feels more like a capable literary narrator describing the tutor's experience than a direct channel into his unique way of seeing the world. The voice is effective but not particularly memorable or character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone, fitting the genre. However, it lacks a specific, idiosyncratic perceptual signature, often feeling more like a generic myth-teller than the distinct internal voice of this particular artist. The POV is stable, but psychic distance remains too great to create true intimacy or immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinctive signature, relying on somewhat generic literary phrasing. The primary weakness is the mechanical repetition of key phrases ("quilted together," "kintsugi intentions," etc.), which makes the voice feel templated and inorganic. This tic disrupts the prose rhythm and undermines the narrator's credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone that aligns with the story's aims. The psychic distance feels appropriate for the "aloof" character. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often relying on filter phrases ("she felt a sense of...") and generic descriptive language ("vivid colors and textures") that slightly dulls its immediacy and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and contemplative voice. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to generic phrasing and emotional summary. The prose texture is smooth but doesn't feel particular to this specific character, reading more like a generalized sensitive archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a lyrical, somber voice appropriate for the story. The narrative distance is well-controlled. The primary weakness is a degree of syntactic monotony, with multiple sentences relying on similar structures and conjunctions ("and as she...", "but she..."). This creates a slightly predictable rhythm that flattens the prose's texture, particularly in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is the story's most significant weakness. It employs a detached, academic register ("catastrophic loss of individuality," "complex and often contradictory nature") that feels inconsistent with the POV of a forager in a ravine. This elevated, explanatory style keeps the reader at a distance, turning visceral experience into abstract analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, maintaining a steady psychic distance. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on filter verbs ("Kael felt," "Kael saw") that distance the reader. While the tone is well-maintained, the prose itself doesn't have the unique texture or rhythm that would elevate it to a truly memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is dominated by filter verbs ("Emilia's thoughts turn," "Emilia felt," "Emilia realized") that create distance and summarize experience rather than immersing the reader in it. The voice is functional but generic, reporting events rather than channeling a specific character's consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice is generic high-fantasy. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on a repetitive "She felt a sense of..." cadence that distances the reader from the queen's experience. The single line of dialogue is functional but stiff, failing to add texture.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The voice has a consistent lyrical and contemplative quality. However, its distinctiveness is compromised by a reliance on a small cluster of abstract, prompt-like phrases ("density of presence," "directed spontaneity") that feel imposed on the character rather than emerging from a unique perceptual signature. This creates a voice that is more philosophical treatise than individual mind.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is stable and the voice is consistent in its philosophical, articulate tone. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading more like an authorial thesis than an individual's unique internal world. The voice relies on repeating its core concepts ("feral nostalgia," "distill chaos into narrative") in a way that feels more like a scaffold than an organic expression of thought.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and overly articulate, leaning on a therapeutic or academic register that feels distant from a lived, personal experience. The language lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like an essay on a concept than the internal world of a specific character under pressure. While consistent, the voice's abstraction keeps the reader at an emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story's reflective mood. The point of view is stable and controlled. The prose rhythm supports the serene atmosphere. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; Kaito's way of noticing the world, while pleasant, doesn't feel unique, occasionally lapsing into generalized descriptions of mystical feelings ("uncanny connection").

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, ethereal tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it; it reads more like a well-executed genre voice than a unique character's perspective. The prose doesn't fully capture the promised novelty of a "gossip-column exorcist," defaulting to a safer, more conventional mystical register.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its formal, elevated tone, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose feels generic for the mystical fantasy genre, relying on common abstractions ("fabric of existence," "recesses of her own soul") rather than a unique character perspective. The narrative distance remains fixed and remote, preventing a deeper connection to Aria's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a formal, contemplative tone appropriate to the subject matter. However, the voice lacks a distinct character-specific signature, reading more like a generic philosophical narrator. The overuse of filter verbs ("the shepherd felt," "the shepherd's thoughts grew") creates psychic distance and flattens the immediacy of the character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, contemplative tone. However, the voice feels generic and academic, relying heavily on abstract jargon that seems mismatched with the character's supposed profession. Frequent use of filter verbs ("Lena felt," "Lena believed") creates psychic distance, and the prose lacks a distinctive perceptual signature, reading more like a philosophical essay than the intimate thoughts of a specific individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    The point of view is consistent, but the narrative voice is dominated by a formal, academic register that often feels stilted and distances the reader from the emotional core of the conflict. While consistent with the character's profession, this intellectualized voice flattens the emotional texture. The prose has a clear "perceptual signature"—that of an academic—but it lacks the rhythmic variation needed to convey her underlying distress.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's lyrical, melancholic tone. The prose maintains a controlled, elevated register that fits the philosophical nature of the operator. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, at times feeling more like a disembodied narrator describing a concept than a character experiencing a reality. The psychic distance remains fixed, missing opportunities to modulate for emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    POV is stable and technically correct, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose relies on familiar, lyrical phrasing ("fading light danced across the water") that feels impersonal. While the vocabulary is controlled, the repetitive sentence structures and recycled key phrases create a monotonous rhythm that undermines the attempt at a thoughtful, unique voice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person POV is stable, but the narrative voice struggles to consistently embody the "politely anarchic" tone it claims. The prose often defaults to a more standard, earnest narrative style that explains emotions rather than filtering them through a unique perceptual signature, slightly flattening the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable, and the lyrical, elevated voice is consistent with the story's fantastical tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature. Despite the character's blindness and skin-reading ability, the narrative perception doesn't feel uniquely shaped by these traits, often reading like a standard poetic third-person narration rather than a deeply embodied, non-visual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice is more explanatory than experiential. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs and abstract summaries of Aria's feelings ("Aria felt an inexplicable connection"), creating psychic distance. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading as a clean but generic narration of events rather than a deep dive into a unique character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and slightly mythic tone that is perfectly suited to the material. Psychic distance remains stable, giving the reader access to the advisor's perceptions without collapsing into overly analytical interiority. The prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature, focusing on sound, silence, and light, which enhances the story's fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is overwrought and relies on abstractions. The prose has a distinct but uniform texture of elevated, often unearned, emotional descriptors ("volcanic tenderness") and grand pronouncements. This creates a psychic distance that summarizes emotion rather than immersing the reader in Elian's specific, moment-to-moment perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone, but it lacks a distinct character-particular signature. The prose often feels more like an authorial entity explaining poetic concepts ("the hush of the universe inhaling, a moment of profound stillness...") rather than filtering the experience through a unique consciousness. While functional, the voice is generic for its genre.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is clear and functional. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often resorting to generic descriptions of internal states. The prose doesn't fully embody the character's supposed "calculated spontaneity," instead maintaining a steady, observant distance that dampens the potential for a unique narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The distant third-person POV and lyrical voice are controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct, fable-like tone that suits the material. The narrative stance is confident, and the psychic distance remains stable, effectively creating the sense of watching a ritual unfold. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, even if the vocabulary and syntax become repetitive elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent in its literary, mystical tone, and the single point of view is stable. The prose maintains a controlled, quiet rhythm that aligns with the story's theme. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on a collection of slightly generic poetic abstractions ("liminal hour," "otherworldly energy") that feel more like authorial style than a character's specific way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is consistent, and the lyrical voice generally matches the story's mystical tone. A weakness appears when the narration briefly adopts a broad, philosophical register ("violence was becoming a relic of the past..."), which feels less like Kael's specific interiority and more like authorial commentary. This slight drift in psychic distance momentarily disrupts an otherwise controlled narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent in its formal, literary tone but maintains too much psychic distance. It often describes Echo's state with diagnostic labels ("emotional void," "moral ambiguity") that read as external analysis rather than filtered perception. This prevents full immersion in the character's specific, biased worldview, making the voice feel more explanatory than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyrical voice is distinct and sustained, but the relentlessly elevated poetic register lacks modulation and rhythmic variety, creating a monolithic texture rather than a voice that evolves under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person narrative voice is consistent in its gentle, fable-like tone, maintaining a stable psychic distance. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a detached storyteller than a perspective filtered through a specific character's consciousness. The prose is clear but generic, failing to capture the unique worldview of the "colorblind painter" it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature, feeling more generic than character-specific. The sentence structure becomes repetitive, particularly in its reliance on "The [character] [verb]..." formations, which flattens the prose rhythm and dulls its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, melancholic tone. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling like a generalized "literary" voice rather than one filtered through the specific biases and worldview of a grieving artisan. While technically competent, the voice doesn't achieve a memorable or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is compromised by severe repetition of key phrases ("steadily curious," "rain-beaded skylight loft"). This mechanical recurrence creates a template-like cadence that undermines the development of a distinct perceptual signature. The voice feels constructed around a checklist of elements rather than organically emanating from a unique character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is stable and the elevated, formal voice is appropriate for the character, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose often slips into abstract summary ("the very fabric of reality was unfolding") rather than grounding the experience in the character's unique sensory filter. The narrative voice feels more like a dispassionate report on the events than a direct channel to the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The voice has a deliberate, lyrical quality that matches the setting and tone. However, it lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes feeling more like a generic high-fantasy narrator than the specific mind of the "sharp-eyed dusk noticer."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It often feels like a generalized, lyrical narrator describing a mood rather than filtering the world through Lena’s specific mind. The prose relies on a limited palette of recurring phrases ("shimmering stillness," "quietly vivid," "shedding layers"), which creates a monotonous rhythm and flattens the voice into a template.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice strains for profundity and often lands on generic or overwrought phrasing ("bearing the weight of centuries," "tissue of reality"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature, sounding more like a generic fantasy narrator than the specific, conflicted character described in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is stable and maintains a consistent, fittingly mystical tone. However, the narrative voice leans heavily on filter verbs ("the crystal gazer felt," "they knew," "they realized"), which creates psychic distance and dulls immediacy. The prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, reading more as a generalized mystic narrator than a specific, individual character.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently with a stable, lyrical voice. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a generic poetic narrator than the specific interiority of this character. While the tone is controlled, the prose doesn't fully reflect a unique mind under pressure, relying on elevated, sometimes impersonal descriptions of cosmic awe.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, slightly detached tone. However, the perceptual signature isn't highly particular; Asa's way of seeing the world feels more like a standard literary narrator than a unique character filter. The prose serves the atmosphere but lacks a distinctive rhythm or syntactic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The tone is lofty and declarative, feeling more like a summary of a philosophical experience than an immediate immersion in one. The prose often describes the philosopher's state from the outside rather than filtering the world through his unique consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story maintains a consistent and elevated lyrical voice appropriate for its mythic tone, and the collective third-person POV is handled cleanly. The prose has a distinct rhythm, but this rhythm lacks modulation; it maintains the same cadence throughout, which makes the narrative feel somewhat monotonous and emotionally flat by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice has a distinct, formal texture ("seraphically mundane"). However, the psychic distance feels slightly too great, resulting in a narrative voice that often describes the bellhop's internal state with philosophical abstraction rather than immersing the reader in their direct, sensory experience. The voice is controlled and purposeful but lacks the intimacy needed to make the final emotional shift feel fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person POV is stable and controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. However, the narrative voice is generic, relying on a formal, slightly overwrought tone common to the fantasy genre without establishing a unique signature. The decision to summarize the climactic dialogue—"The words... were a gentle rebuke"—is a significant weakness, robbing the story's most important moment of its direct power and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The narrative voice establishes a contemplative, observant mood that fits the story. The primary weakness is the occasional use of overly writerly or diagnostic phrases to describe Maya's internal state, such as "the tone of her thoughts was drifting moored," which creates narrative distance and reads more like an authorial label than a character's authentic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, fittingly formal voice for the "stargazer" character. The narrative has a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on sensory details. However, the voice is slightly weakened by a reliance on common metaphors like "reignited the flame" in pivotal emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and functional. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often describing events and internal states in a generic, abstract manner ("a coherent narrative that spoke of implanted destiny"). The prose does not modulate effectively with pressure, maintaining a measured, reportorial tone even during the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is mostly stable and the lyrical voice suits the reflective mood. However, the narrative is marred by jarring shifts in register that break the character's voice. The line "Through somatic markers..." is clinically detached and reads like a psychology textbook, pulling the reader out of Amira's lived experience and betraying an authorial hand.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is tonally consistent. However, the prose suffers from a repetitive, incantatory cadence, with many sentences following an identical "The [noun], a [symbol], [verbed]" structure. This syntactic monotony, combined with a recurring and somewhat generic lyrical vocabulary ("otherworldly," "ethereal," "unseen"), flattens the voice and reduces its distinctiveness over the course of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is clear and controlled for most of the story. However, the prose has a generic literary quality, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The voice loses some of its immersive quality at the end, shifting from showing the character's experience to summarizing the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with technical competence and remains stable throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on standard literary constructions instead of a prose style unique to Aria's mind. While the voice is clear and functional, it doesn't achieve the particularity required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is consistent with the story's serene tone. The prose has a distinct lyrical quality that serves the atmosphere well. The narrative lacks a truly particular perceptual signature, however, settling into a somewhat generalized contemplative voice rather than one with unique biases or sensory filters that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. However, the prose occasionally slips into an explanatory mode, telling the reader the function of an action immediately after describing it (e.g., explaining why she "transliterates emotions"). This slightly distances the reader from the character's direct experience, making the voice feel more authored than purely filtered through the protagonist's consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice feels generic and burdened by repetitive phrasing. The recurrence of phrases like "orbits of regret" and "solemn playfulness" and the over-reliance on "As she..." sentence structures create a monotonous rhythm. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on abstraction instead of character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a lyrical, dreamlike quality that suits the material. The narrative distance is stable and the perceptual signature, focused on sound and sensation, is effective. The prose texture is distinct, but it occasionally dips into a generic "poetic" register without the specificity needed for an exceptional voice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature. Its lyrical quality becomes monotonous due to a recurring sentence structure and heavy reliance on a few key phrases ("emergent hush," "lilac unease"). This repetition makes the voice feel more like an authorial device than the authentic internal experience of the character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading as a generalized authorial lyricism rather than Aria’s specific way of seeing the world. The prose has a consistent texture, but its reliance on abstract terminology over concrete, character-bound perception keeps the reader at a distance. The voice serves the mood but fails to fully inhabit the character.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the lyrical voice fits the story's tone. However, the narration is severely hampered by a pervasive overuse of filter verbs ("Echo felt," "Echo knew"). This pattern creates a psychic distance that tells the reader about Echo's emotional state rather than immersing them in it, dulling the immediacy of key moments like her growing excitement or final sense of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is controlled. The psychic distance is appropriate for the meditative, internal focus of the story. The prose, however, sometimes adopts a slightly formal, explanatory register that reports on Luna's state rather than fully inhabiting her perceptual signature, creating a layer of distance from her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is overly reliant on filter verbs ("Aria felt," "she saw") and declarative statements of emotion, which creates psychic distance and dulls immediacy. The voice serves the descriptive purpose of the story but fails to bring Aria's internal world to life with unique texture or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is stable and the elevated, lyrical voice is tonally consistent throughout the piece. While competent, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or idiosyncrasy. It reads as a generic "fable" narrator rather than a unique perspective, which keeps it from achieving a higher level of distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, albeit somewhat generic, literary tone. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, the narration leans on filter phrases ("she felt a sense of...") which creates distance and dulls immediacy. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the voice from functional to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the voice suffers from a register mismatch. Phrases like "palimpsest promise," "geological formation," and "spindrift serenity" feel more like an author's high-concept vocabulary than the plausible interiority of a "gloom-hill coachman." While the prose is controlled and rhythmic, this elevated, analytical diction creates a distance from the character, making his thoughts feel curated rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, meditative tone. However, the prose sometimes drifts into a high-register, analytical vocabulary ("temporal dislocation," "phototropic") that feels slightly detached from the character's immediate, embodied experience. This creates a minor but persistent psychic distance, making the voice feel more like a narrator's elegant summary than a character's internal signature.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent lyrical distance appropriate for the story's meditative tone. The voice is clean and purposeful, modulating effectively with the rising sense of peace and resolve. It avoids technical flaws but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or idiosyncratic rhythm that would make it unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained. However, the narrative voice, while lyrical, is monotonous in its rhythm and elevated register, failing to modulate with the rising and falling pressures of Lyra's internal state. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond a generalized contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice fits the whimsical, contemplative mood. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally resorting to generic phrasing. While competent, the voice doesn't achieve the unique texture or rhythmic control that would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose relies heavily on cliché ("twinkled like diamonds," "bated breath") and a reporting psychic distance that tells the reader Lyra's feelings instead of immersing them in her experience. The voice does not modulate effectively with the supposed rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, with no technical errors. The narrative voice, however, is generic and leans on elevated but somewhat clichéd descriptions ("inky blackness," "ghostly presence," "otherworldly energy"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would filter the world through Lyra's specific combination of prudence, claustrophobia, and adventurousness.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Point of view is consistently maintained in third-person limited. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a formal, analytical register that feels external to the character's immediate experience. Phrases like "a poignant reminder" or "a symbol of the complex... nature" read more like authorial commentary than the artist's internal thoughts, creating an emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs and emotional summary ("She felt a shiver," "she began to feel an unsettling sense"), which creates psychic distance and tells the reader about Emilia's state rather than immersing them in it. The voice is functional but doesn't have the unique texture or rhythm that would elevate the material.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The point of view is consistent and the psychic distance is controlled. However, the narrative voice is overly elevated and somewhat generic, lacking a distinctive perceptual signature. It relies on high-concept vocabulary ("pixelated amnesty," "luminous disbelief") that feels more like authorial imposition than a character's genuine internal language, keeping the reader at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, contemplative distance. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a more generic, authorial register that explains concepts ("the transience of value," "this fundamental human impulse"). This prevents the prose from feeling truly rooted in the character's specific mind and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, tending towards a somewhat generic, elevated literary tone. Phrases like "midnight solace" and "celestial map to navigate the depths of their minds" are evocative but feel more authorial than character-specific. The prose is clean but doesn't exhibit the unique texture of a truly memorable narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Much of the prose relies on a somewhat distant, declarative tone that reports on the druid's state and goals rather than filtering the world through their unique perspective, limiting the voice's texture and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the lyrical, somewhat distant voice suits the mythic, fairy-tale tone of the piece. The narrative voice has a distinct, elevated texture. However, the psychic distance remains quite wide throughout, preventing a more visceral, immediate connection to Aria's experience, especially during the climactic vision which is described more than it is felt through her senses.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited point of view is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinctive character. It adopts a generic lyrical-gothic register that feels deliberate but ultimately monotonous in its rhythm and word choice. The prose offers a consistent texture but fails to create a truly particular perceptual signature for the "reckless idealist."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, with no technical slips. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic phrasing to convey emotional states. The psychic distance remains somewhat remote, telling us about Jack's feelings rather than immersing us within his direct, sensory experience of them.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice relies heavily on filtering and summarizing. The prose is saturated with phrases like "felt," "seemed," "recalled," and "knew," which creates a significant psychic distance and reports on Elara's experience rather than immersing the reader in it. This continuous filtering flattens the voice and prevents the development of a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, formal tone and deliberate rhythm, fitting the librarian's character. However, the psychic distance is vast and the voice is more authorial-explanatory than character-filtered. It lacks a specific perceptual signature, favoring abstract conceptualization ("This fluidity of identity was not just a philosophical musing...") over immediate, embodied experience, which holds the reader at a clinical distance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is severely weakened by an extreme overuse of filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew"), which creates distance and dulls immediacy at nearly every beat. This tic prevents the voice from achieving a unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic phrasing ("testament to forgotten journeys," "passage of time etched on crumbling structures"). The prose feels more like a conventional "literary" style than the specific, idiosyncratic viewpoint of this particular character.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice throughout. The prose has a distinct, formal texture fitting the dreamlike atmosphere. However, the voice lacks a truly character-particular perceptual signature; the way the dreamer observes the world feels more aligned with the story's overall aesthetic than with a unique individual's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the third-person limited POV is technically consistent, the narrative voice is generic and overwrought. The prose strains for a literary effect with phrases like "velvet observatory" and "mulberry ache," but the overall texture is uniform and lacks a distinctive character signature. Frequent use of filter verbs and summarizing interiority ("Elian's thoughts turned to...") keeps the reader at a distance from the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is distinct and maintained with impressive consistency, creating a coherent and immersive tone. The point of view remains tightly controlled, and Aria's perceptual signature—focused on light, color, and vibration—is specific and well-suited to her unique task and mindset. The prose effectively mirrors the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often lapsing into generic descriptions of emotional states. The prose relies heavily on repetitive sentence structures, particularly the "As she..." construction, which creates a monotonous rhythm. While the tone is consistent, the narrative voice is more of a vehicle for thematic summary than a unique lens on the world.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently. However, the narrative voice is overly analytical and abstract, reading more like a philosophical explanation of the character than an embodiment of their perspective. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on conceptual jargon ("metaphorical shroud," "protected vulnerability") instead of a unique, character-driven way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent, measured, and formal voice appropriate for the meditative scene. The voice has a distinct texture, but it is built on a very small set of recurring phrases. This repetition, while perhaps intended to be incantatory, ultimately creates a monotonous rhythm that flattens the narrative rather than deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The point of view is stable and the elevated, mythic voice is consistently maintained, creating a distinct narrative texture. The psychic distance is appropriate for a non-human consciousness focused on cosmic patterns. However, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally lapsing into generalized philosophical language rather than a specific, character-bound way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance appropriate for a contemplative fantasy piece. The voice is lyrical and fits the tone of the world. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would make Eira's way of seeing the world unique; it often reads as a competent but generic fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is generic, failing to establish a distinct perceptual signature for Kael. For a lamplighter, his way of seeing is not unique. The prose maintains a consistent, slightly mystical tone that suits the material, but relies on familiar phrasing that dulls its immediacy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the subject matter. The psychic distance is well-controlled. The voice, however, lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic phrasing for emotional beats. Its effectiveness is significantly hampered by the repetitive sentence structures that flatten the narrative rhythm, especially in the final third of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece maintains a consistent, elevated third-person POV with a distinct somber and lyrical voice. The narrative distance is controlled and appropriate for the mythic tone. The primary weakness is that the voice, while consistent, lacks a truly particular perceptual signature; it feels more like a generic "poetic narrator" voice than the specific internal world of this one character, slightly flattening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person POV is stable, and the voice maintains a consistent lyrical, slightly detached tone. However, the prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and repeated key phrases ("sapphire viaduct," "plausible impossibility," "earnestly naive"). This repetition, while creating a ritualistic cadence, can also feel mechanical and constrains the voice, making it sound more like an answer to a prompt than a unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.5)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is a generic, formal literary construct that lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The warden's internal experience is articulated in prose that feels interchangeable with the external description. The voice's texture comes from syntactic repetition rather than character-specific observation, which keeps the reader at a distance from the protagonist's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, observant tone. However, the psychic distance is often held too far out through the repeated use of filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "knew"). This pattern slightly dulls the immediacy of key moments, telling the reader Elara's reaction rather than letting them experience it through her direct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is stable. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, employing a somewhat generic, elevated prose that feels more descriptive than character-driven. While competent, the voice doesn't modulate significantly under pressure or reveal unique biases in a way that would make it truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled without any head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is somewhat generic, relying on a formal, slightly distant register that doesn't always feel specific to a character in deep meditative struggle. Frequent use of filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") creates a layer of distance between the reader and Kaito's direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It leans on a slightly elevated, generic literary register with phrases like "orthogonal approaches" and "storm-born silence" that feel imposed rather than native to the character. The prose describes her thought process more than it inhabits it, creating a sense of psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.0)
    The point of view is stable and the elevated, mythic voice is consistently maintained throughout the performance. However, the voice loses its connection to the character's perspective in the final third, shifting into an omniscient, authorial summary that distances the reader from the Maestro's immediate experience of exhaustion and satisfaction. This shift weakens the piece's overall focalization and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice is consistent in its elevated, mystical register. This creates a unified mood. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, relying on a somewhat generic fantasy lexicon ("ethereal tentacles," "dimensional harmonics") that can feel more performed than authentic to a unique character.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the voice is marred by tonal inconsistencies. The elevated, fantastical language ("ember nexus," "Sisyphean task") clashes jarringly with the modern idiom "when the penny drops," which appears twice and breaks the established register. While the narrative stance is stable, this lexical mismatch suggests a lack of full control over the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance. The voice has a coherent, lyrical tone suited to the material. However, it is weakened by an over-reliance on filter verbs ("Aria felt," "she knew," "Aria realized") that dull the immediacy of key moments of discovery. The narrative voice feels more like a generic genre template than a distinct perceptual signature belonging to this specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with no technical errors. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a generic, lofty register ("ethereal beauty," "symphony of sensation") that feels disconnected from the grounded reality of a ferry deckhand. The voice serves the plot but fails to create a truly memorable or specific character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV is stable and the voice has a consistent, dreamy texture. However, the prose rhythm becomes monotonous due to syntactic repetition. The frequent recycling of key phrases ("rational enchantment," "texture of connection") flattens the voice, making it feel more like a mechanical recitation of concepts than the evolving perception of a unique character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.1)
    The third-person POV is stable but the narrative voice is generic and distant, relying heavily on filter phrases ("Lyra's thoughts turned to," "Lyra felt a sense of"). The prose is marked by repetitive sentence structures ("As she walked...", "As she entered...") that create a monotonous rhythm and fail to establish a distinct character voice or perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on lyrical but somewhat generic phrasing ("otherworldly silence," "mystical realm"). The prose often relies on filter verbs and emotional labeling ("Aria felt an instant connection") rather than embedding the experience in Aria's unique perception. The psychic distance remains static, observing emotions more than inhabiting them under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is clear and functional. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Lyra's internal experience is often conveyed through standard phrasing ("her mind racing," "felt a sense of peace wash over her"). The voice doesn't modulate significantly under pressure, remaining a competent but generic narrative vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is consistently lyrical and somber. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on a shared pool of evocative but generic phrasing ("otherworldly light," "eerie beauty," "universe was finally willing to yield its secrets"). While the tone is effective, the voice itself feels more constructed to fit the mood than to emerge from a unique character's consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elevated tone appropriate for a mythic tale. The third-person POV is controlled and stable, focusing tightly on the storyteller's perceptions and process. While the prose has a distinct texture, it occasionally relies on a repetitive sentence structure ("The storyteller watched...", "The storyteller's task was...", "The storyteller's voice...") that slightly flattens the rhythm. However, the overall voice successfully establishes and holds the story's world.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It relies heavily on abstract nouns and filter-verb constructions ("Lena felt a sense of...") which distance the reader from the experience. While the tone is consistent, the prose itself feels more like a generic report on emotions than an embodiment of a unique perspective under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is consistent, and the elevated, fairy-tale voice aligns with the story's tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling like a generic narrative voice for the fantasy genre. The sentence structure is often repetitive, creating a monotonous rhythm that flattens the emotional potential of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, slightly lyrical tone. Psychic distance is managed well, focusing on the mailman's perceptions and immediate concerns. The voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, however, and at key moments—particularly the ending—it shifts from the character’s plausible interiority into a more authorial, thematic register that over-explains the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    Point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's magical, melancholic tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to the character; it reads as a generic, elegant narrator rather than specifically a carpenter's mode of perception. While technically proficient, the prose lacks the unique texture that would elevate it from competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's contemplative mood. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture, effectively establishing the librarian’s perceptual signature. The psychic distance remains controlled, creating a sense of "observed solitude" that aligns perfectly with the central character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, moody tone that is appropriate for the story. The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the perceptual signature is fitting for an artist focused on light and color. The main weakness is a lack of modulation; the prose maintains the same elevated, rhythmic cadence throughout, which flattens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, elevated, and somewhat mythic voice. The tone is appropriate for the material, creating a sense of wonder and solemnity. The prose, however, sometimes slips into generic abstractions ("a mixture of curiosity and determination," "deliberate and intuitive"), which slightly flattens the otherwise distinct narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its literary tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to generalized descriptions of emotion ("felt a sense of trepidation") instead of filtering the world through a uniquely personal lens. While competent and controlled, the prose lacks the specific rhythmic and syntactic character that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, slightly ethereal tone appropriate for the subject matter. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on the archivist's perceptions and internal state. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature; the world is filtered through a lens of sorrow, precision, and fierce gentleness, creating a memorable and immersive narrative experience.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person POV is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the magical tone. However, the narrative voice is generic rather than possessing a distinct perceptual signature tied to Aria herself. The prose rhythm becomes monotonous due to a reliance on similar sentence structures, which prevents the voice from modulating effectively with the rising magic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the formal, incantatory voice is tonally consistent. However, the voice's distinctiveness relies almost entirely on the repeated use of a few unusual phrases ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest"). This makes the prose feel more like a stylistic exercise than an authentic narrative perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice aligns with the protagonist’s intellectual persona. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on clichés (“more to the structure than met the eye”) and generic descriptions of internal states. The psychic distance feels too great, frequently summarizing Elara’s feelings rather than filtering the world through her unique sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and well-suited to the contemplative narrative. The POV is stable and maintains an appropriate psychic distance for the story's intellectual focus. However, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally slipping into familiar phrasing ("a method to my madness") that softens its unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, mystical tone. However, the voice relies on a very narrow and repetitive lexicon ("tinkersong," "driftingly alert") that begins to feel like a stylistic tic rather than an organic expression. This recurrence makes the perceptual signature feel manufactured, slightly dulling the otherwise effective atmospheric prose and narrative control.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the calm, reflective voice matches the story's tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to generic constructions to describe emotional states. The psychic distance remains stable but never achieves a high level of specificity or individuality that would make the voice memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The point of view is consistent and the voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative tone. However, the prose verges on being overwrought and self-conscious, particularly with the repeated, branded phrase "dusty starlight." The narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generalized abstractions ("kaleidoscope of shapes and textures") instead of a character-specific way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person POV is maintained with consistent control and a fittingly contemplative psychic distance. The voice is literary and controlled, successfully supporting the story's heightened, still tone. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more as a polished, authorial narrative than a voice uniquely filtered through this specific artist's mind and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the voice is consistent with the story's gentle, adventurous tone. The narrative perspective effectively conveys Eli's focus and excitement. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variety, occasionally relying on common phrasings ("heart swelled with excitement," "curious nature kicked in") that feel more functional than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the prose has a distinct, elevated tone. However, the narrative voice relies heavily on filter verbs and emotional summary ("seemed to absorb," "hoped to uncover," "felt a sense of peace"). This creates psychic distance, telling the reader Kael's feelings instead of grounding them in immediate, embodied perception, which dulls the story's emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is a stable, if distant, third-person. The narrative voice is consistent in its gentle, fable-like tone, but it lacks a distinctive perceptual signature or texture. The prose is clear but overly formal and summary-driven, describing events from a great remove rather than immersing the reader in a specific consciousness or moment of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the mythic, solemn tone. The prose creates a specific rhythmic and perceptual signature for the adjuster, filtering the world through their sense of immense duty. Psychic distance is stable and effective, drawing the reader into the character's quiet, focused mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is heavily reliant on filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew"), which creates narrative distance and dulls immediacy. This stylistic tic, repeated throughout the story, prevents the voice from developing a unique texture or rhythm that reflects the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with good control over psychic distance. However, the narrative voice is more functional than distinct; it lacks a memorable perceptual signature or rhythmic quality that would elevate the prose. While free of major errors like head-hopping, the voice doesn't achieve a unique texture, remaining in a safe, descriptive register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control and a consistent psychic distance. The voice is lyrical and well-suited to the serene, contemplative atmosphere of the story. While effective, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature or rhythm that would make it uniquely Ember's, occasionally reading as a more generalized literary fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with no technical errors like head-hopping. The narrative voice, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on standard literary prose and somewhat abstract descriptions of emotion. While functional and clear, the voice does not have the unique texture or rhythmic control that would make it a standout element of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that fits the fable-like tone of the story. However, the psychic distance is too great, often slipping into a "helpful narrator" mode that summarizes character traits and motivations rather than allowing them to emerge through action. The voice, while pleasant, lacks a distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate the prose beyond conventional lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on a generalized, slightly lofty tone. The prose is compromised by unearned technical jargon ("synaptic plasticity") that reads as an inorganic explanation for her abilities rather than a natural part of her worldview. This creates a register mismatch that distances the reader from her internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The narrative voice, however, leans on generic fantasy phrasing ("cryptic texts," "mist-shrouded mountains," "dark recesses") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. For a "prism-minded archivist," her way of seeing and processing the world does not feel particularly unique or insightful; the voice is functional but lacks the specific texture that would make it memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyrical, somewhat distant third-person voice is consistent and well-suited to the fable-like quality of the narrative. The prose maintains a distinct, quiet rhythm that effectively carries the story's atmospheric weight. The point of view is controlled and stable, with no notable slips in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice, while tonally consistent, suffers from a register mismatch. The lyrical, sweeping prose feels at odds with the character's defining trait of being "thoughtfully precise." Furthermore, the repetitive sentence structure, particularly the frequent use of "As..." clauses, creates a monotonous rhythm that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone. However, the voice often feels more authorial than character-driven, using elevated, abstract language ("theatrical sincerity," "magnitude of the moment") that distances the reader from Elara's immediate experience. The prose has a distinct texture, but it lacks a specific perceptual signature that would make the voice feel unique to this particular character.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice is distinct, with a lyrical and slightly elevated diction that fits the fable-like quality of the story ("wildflower hush," "otherworldly language"). The perceptual signature is clear, heavily biased towards the olfactory, which is character-appropriate. While the prose texture is strong, the voice occasionally leans on abstract, capitalized concepts that feel less grounded in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is clear and functional. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or texture; it reads more like a tidy mission log than the perspective of a character experiencing profound discovery. The prose does not modulate significantly to reflect moments of tension or awe, and the reliance on filter verbs ("Lyra felt," "Lyra noticed") creates a sense of distance from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative distance is stable. The voice has a formal, analytical quality appropriate for the character's profession. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into the same abstract, thematic jargon ("hazy precision") that feels imposed by the author rather than generated by the character's mind, making the voice feel somewhat generic and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable, and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical, and elevated tone. However, the narrative voice often feels more authorial than character-bound, explaining concepts like the "sculpted hush" from a distance rather than filtering them purely through Elian's immediate, stressed perception. While controlled, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would separate Elian's mind from a philosophical narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability, and the formal, slightly solemn voice is tonally consistent with the subject matter. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generalized phrasing ("otherworldly energy," "mystical realms") rather than a character-particular way of seeing. The voice is functional and clear but stops short of being memorable or deeply inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent with the story's lyrical, speculative tone. The prose has a deliberate, measured rhythm that suits the methodical nature of the letterpress operator. However, the perceptual signature isn't deeply idiosyncratic; the narrative voice describes Echo's internal state more than it truly inhabits it, keeping the reader at a slight remove.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and well-suited to the mythic tone. However, the overt thematic statements read as authorial intrusion, momentarily breaking from Eira's specific point of view and disrupting the otherwise controlled narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is tonally consistent. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic, abstract language ("heightened awareness," "deeper level," "profound truth") to describe the mystical experience. The prose feels more like a summary of the event than a direct rendering of the character's unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is maintained consistently, and the lyrical voice is appropriate for the story's reflective, melancholic mood. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus on the spinner's internal experience. The voice, however, lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, relying on somewhat conventional poetic phrasing ("contours of her own heart") that makes it feel polished but not unique.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The first-person POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a distinct lyrical and philosophical texture throughout. However, the narrative stance feels somewhat detached, with a high degree of self-aware articulation that can distance the reader from the physical immediacy of the forge. The diction, particularly phrases like "azure defiance," occasionally tips into a register that feels more authorial than character-driven, creating a minor but persistent crack in the voice's authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently. The primary weakness is the narrative voice, which relies heavily on repetitive sentence structures, particularly the "The map maker's [noun]..." template. This syntactic monotony creates a mechanical, dispassionate rhythm that undercuts the supposed sensory and emotional intensity of the journey. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reporting events and feelings generically rather than filtering them through a unique consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, creating a consistent, melancholic voice appropriate for the character. The skipper's perceptual signature is clear—he notices textures, subtle light, and the emotional weight of objects. While the prose rhythm is occasionally monotonous, the voice is distinct and holds steady under the story's emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice feels generic and archetypal, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The prose relies on repeating a small pool of key phrases ("Otherworldly routine," "steer the dawn," "coalescing"), which creates a monotonous, incantatory effect that ultimately feels flat rather than lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on pre-packaged, slightly generic phrases ("mystical stillness," "valley-mist wonder"). It reads more like a polished narrative register than the specific internal world of a "watchful dye master."

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, fable-like tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into an explanatory mode that feels external to the character. For example, "For in this world, sorrow was not just a feeling..." reads like a world-building note rather than a character's filtered thought.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    The point of view is stable, and the lyrical voice is tonally consistent with the fairy-tale subject matter. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a detached, explanatory mode. Lines like "...a metaphor for the connections..." break from the character's immediate experience, making the narration feel like an external summary rather than an immersive, character-filtered perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is clean but generic, leaning on abstract concepts ("emotional resonance," "nestled paradoxes") rather than grounding the experience in Elys's unique way of seeing the world. The voice feels more like an omniscient narrator explaining a character's journey than a close psychic rendering of that journey.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone appropriate for the story's gentle mood. The psychic distance is consistent but quite far, lending a slightly detached, observant quality to the narration. While the prose serves the story, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would make the voice memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the subject matter. While the prose is controlled, the perceptual signature feels more generic to the genre than specific to Elara. The voice serves the atmosphere well but doesn't reveal a particularly unique or complex interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice is generic and relies on clichés ("a living, breathing thing that pulsed with its own rhythm"). The prose oscillates between gritty description and abstract, philosophical statements that don't always feel rooted in the character's immediate experience. Dialogue is sparse and functional but lacks a distinctive character signature.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical quality appropriate for the story's tone. However, the prose is somewhat hampered by a reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she sensed," "she became aware of") which create unnecessary distance. A more direct embodiment of her perceptions would have strengthened the voice's immediacy, particularly during moments of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained. However, the narrative voice, while aiming for a literary tone, sometimes feels generic and overly explanatory ("She was creating a painting with something behind it – a hidden depth..."). The prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally slipping into a neutral voice that reports on emotional states rather than filtering the world through a unique consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly and the narrative voice is consistent throughout. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or memorable texture; it is functional and clear but not particularly striking. The prose effectively conveys the story's events in a summary fashion but does not modulate in rhythm or intensity to reflect Aria's internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    The point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic narrator of mystical tales than a lens filtered through a specific character. The heavy repetition of key phrases ("symphonies of truth," "muted vigor") creates a mechanical rhythm that undermines its intended poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It blends a somewhat detached, android-like narration with psychological jargon that feels imposed. Repetitive sentence structures and phrasing, such as the double use of "a testament to," flatten the voice and create a mechanical rhythm rather than one that modulates with Aria's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained on Emilia, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose often slips into a distant, summarizing tone that reports on Emilia's thoughts and feelings rather than inhabiting them. For instance, "When the outside world intrudes, the calm within can be tested, she thought," feels more like an authorial aphorism than a character-specific insight.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the lyrical tone is maintained throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic abstractions ("symbols of fate," "mysterious familiarity"). The prose rhythm becomes monotonous due to repetitive sentence structures, which flattens the voice and fails to modulate effectively with the rising internal determination.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with stability and the narrative voice is tonally consistent with the story's mysterious, serene atmosphere. While proficient, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic dynamism that would elevate it to a higher tier. It effectively carries the narrative but does not, in itself, feel remarkable or unique.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is consistent, and the formal, serene voice is maintained throughout, fitting the story's tone. The psychic distance is stable and appropriate for the mystical subject matter. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; its vocabulary and rhythm feel like standard high-fantasy narration rather than the product of a unique, individual mind.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a stable psychic distance. The narrative voice is controlled and literary, fitting the tutor's character. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variety, sometimes feeling more like a generic "storyteller" voice. The dialogue is functional for conveying information but lacks the subtext or individual idiom that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable, and the lyrical voice is generally consistent with the story's melancholic mood. However, the voice often defaults to explaining Lyra’s emotional state rather than embodying her perception. This creates a psychic distance that prevents full immersion in her internal experience, especially during the climactic moment of recollection.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice that suits the story's contemplative mood. The diction is controlled and purposeful. The main weakness is the lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the narration sometimes feels like a generalized description of a master artisan, rather than being filtered through the specific biases and worldview of this particular forger under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent in its elevated tone and maintains a clear, close psychic distance to Aria. The perceptual signature is strong, focused effectively on sound and vibration. The primary weakness is a tendency toward syntactic monotony, with many sentences following a similar subject-verb-object structure, which creates a lulling rhythm that can blunt moments of rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story's mystical subject matter. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling like a generic literary narrator rather than filtering perception through Aria's specific mindset. Phrases like "eyes that shone like stars on a moonless night" rely on commonplaces, preventing the voice from feeling truly unique or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, contemplative tone appropriate for the character. The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice frequently slips into an explanatory mode, telling the reader the meaning of symbols or the nature of the character's feelings directly, which creates psychic distance and dulls the immediacy of her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is functional and clear but generic, failing to capture a unique worldview. The frequent use of filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt," "she knew") creates distance and dampens the immediacy of key discoveries and emotional shifts, rendering the voice more reportorial than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is the story's most consistent element, maintaining a distinct, elevated, and prophetic tone throughout. The prose has a deliberate and lyrical quality that fits the "visionary" character. However, this voice is used almost exclusively for summary and abstraction, creating a great psychic distance that prevents any sense of immediacy or emotional investment, keeping the reader a detached observer of a historical account.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the lyrical, slightly melancholic voice is appropriate for the character. However, the prose sometimes feels generic, relying on familiar sentence structures ("The poet's eyes...," "The poet's thoughts...") that create a slightly monotonous rhythm. The voice describes the poet's feelings with clarity but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would make it feel inseparable from the character himself.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is stable and maintains a consistent, ethereal tone with a strong perceptual filter focused on sound and vibration. This aligns well with the character and her task. The voice, however, sometimes feels generic in its lyricism, striving for a profound register that lacks a truly idiosyncratic or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a controlled, formal voice that fits the solemn tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic phrasing ("a newfound sense of purpose," "a surge of determination"). The psychic distance remains quite far, observing the mapper's feelings through filter verbs ("felt," "knew") rather than immersing the reader in her direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice is stable. The primary weakness is an over-reliance on filter verbs and emotional summary ("Maya's thoughts were consumed," "she felt the weight of the past," "Maya felt a sense of liberation"). This creates psychic distance and a generic narrative texture, preventing the development of a distinct perceptual signature that would reflect Maya's specific mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, reflective tone. However, the prose leans on filter verbs ("the chaplain felt") and abstract emotional summaries, creating psychic distance where immediacy is needed. While the narrative voice is competent, it lacks a distinctive perceptual signature, reading as a generic literary narrator rather than a unique character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, elevated tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying heavily on abstract summary rather than filtering the world through Zephyr’s unique mechanical senses. The prose rhythm becomes monotonous due to repetitive syntactic structures, particularly the frequent use of subordinate clauses to begin sentences, which dampens narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled throughout. The narrative voice is functional and clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythm that would make it memorable. The prose is competent but relies on somewhat standard phrasing ("burning need," "fierce determination") rather than developing a unique texture reflective of Lena's specific mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical, and elevated tone that matches the mystical subject matter. POV is stable and controlled. However, the voice's perceptual signature is weak, often defaulting to abstract, thematic language ("shifting landscapes of the heart") instead of grounding perception in the character's unique experience. This makes the voice feel more like a vehicle for the theme than a genuine perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    The first-person voice is consistent and maintains a distinct melancholic, lyrical tone suitable for the story. The POV is controlled, and the perceptual signature is clear. However, the prose is marred by a recurring syntactic pattern—the heavy use of "I felt a sense of..."—which creates a monotonous cadence and flattens the voice's texture, especially during key moments of emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, lyrical distance. The narrative voice is controlled and fits the contemplative mood. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generalized literary narrator than a specific character's way of seeing the world. A minor register drift into academic language at key moments slightly disrupts the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is consistent, maintaining a formal and reverent voice. However, the voice feels constructed from a curated, high-concept lexicon ("kinetic parapet," "whisperfield calm") rather than emerging from a unique perceptual signature. The prose texture is distinct but monotonous, lacking the rhythmic variation needed to fully engage the reader under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a stable, if somewhat generic, serene tone. The prose reflects a calm, observational mind, which aligns with the character. However, the perceptual signature is not particularly distinct, lacking the idiosyncratic texture that would elevate it beyond a standard descriptive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, creating a voice that is both scholarly and intimate. The prose has a distinct, literary rhythm that modulates effectively with the story's emotional beats, from the oppressive quiet of the library to the resolved pace of the final walk. The narrator's perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ethereal, solemn voice is distinct and well-sustained, creating a cohesive narrative tone that fits the material perfectly. Point of view is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance from the prophet. The score is slightly limited by a recurring sentence structure that occasionally creates a mechanical rhythm, rather than a purely organic, voice-driven cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with a stable psychic distance that suits the contemplative, fable-like tone. The narrative voice is controlled, though it lacks a distinct, memorable texture. The primary weakness is not a technical failure of POV but a voice that feels more generic and philosophical than personal to Eli, often describing his state rather than inhabiting his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained without error, but the narrative voice is generic and overly sentimental. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like an author's description of a compassionate act than the specific internal experience of this character. The tone is uniform, missing opportunities for modulation that could heighten the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is functional and expository, describing Lyra's thoughts and actions from a distance rather than embodying her specific, "quietly deliberate" way of seeing the world. The voice efficiently conveys information but fails to establish a memorable or textured character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.1)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a generic, elevated register that feels more authorial than character-driven ("tension between nostalgia and innovation created a sense of dynamic balance"). The prose describes Emilia's emotional state with abstract labels instead of filtering the world through her unique perspective. This results in a voice that reports on a character rather than inhabiting one.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistent, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative voice is lofty and generic, relying on a small pool of abstract, conceptual vocabulary ("zephyr bloom," "ethereal aura") that is repeated throughout. The prose reads more like a philosophical treatise than the lived-in perspective of a specific character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The POV is stable and the voice is generally consistent with the serene, reflective tone. The prose has a gentle rhythm that serves the story's atmosphere. The primary flaw is a drift in psychic distance, where the narration pulls back to offer summative, almost authorial explanations of Aria's internal state, particularly towards the end, rather than remaining tightly focalized in her immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is consistently maintained, and the voice has a stable, literary tone. However, the narrative voice is more descriptive than distinctive, relying on generalized, abstract language ("essence of the human experience," "mysteries of the human heart") rather than a truly unique perceptual signature. The prose serves the story but lacks a memorable or specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its gentle, lyrical tone, and the third-person limited POV is maintained without issue. However, the voice often slips into an external, summary-like distance, explaining Elara's internal state rather than fully inhabiting her perception. This creates a voice that feels more like a fable's narrator than a distinct character's internal experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for the story's tone. The psychic distance remains stable, creating a sense of focused ritual. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature; its elegance sometimes feels generic to the fantasy genre, relying on constructions like "seemed to glow" and "seemed to come alive," which hold the reader at a slight remove from the immediacy of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The point of view is stable and the third-person narrative voice is controlled, reflective, and perfectly suited to the character and tone. The prose exhibits a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elian's methodical and curious mind. There are no technical flaws like head-hopping, and psychic distance is managed consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature. The voice's elevated, mythic tone is well-suited to the subject matter and remains stable even as the weaver's focus intensifies. There are no POV slips or unmotivated distance shifts, resulting in a clean and immersive narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and consistency, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the reflective mood. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or memorable texture. The prose is clean and functional but falls into a generic, gentle rhythm without the syntactic variety or idiosyncratic observation that would elevate it to a truly individual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that matches the protagonist's deliberate pace. However, the narrative voice frequently drifts into a detached, explanatory register that feels more like an author's analysis than a character's filtered consciousness. This damages the psychic immediacy, particularly when articulating the core motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is clean and functional but relies on a standard descriptive register without much texture or rhythmic variation. While technically sound, the voice does little to elevate the material or provide a unique lens on the events.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the quiet, lyrical voice generally fits the character's introverted nature. However, the prose frequently slips into a diagnostic, external register ("The bear's presence was a catalyst..."), which feels less like Elian's internal experience and more like an author's note. This psychic distance undermines the immediacy of his pivotal emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice feels artificial and overwrought. The diction ("errant legend seeker," "master horologist," "ethereal light") creates a sense of authorial intrusion rather than inhabiting a specific character's consciousness. This register drift, combined with the abstract internal monologue, prevents the development of a distinct and credible perceptual signature for Lyra.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the character's philosophical and patient nature. The prose has a calm, measured rhythm that suits the tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature; observations and internal feelings ("she felt a deep sense of connection") are often articulated in somewhat generic terms, missing an opportunity for a more particular and memorable narrative filter.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's greatest strength is its voice. The melancholic, lyrical, and observant point of view is established immediately and sustained with remarkable consistency. The prose rhythm and perceptual signature—a focus on stillness, decay, and faint echoes of life—are perfectly aligned with the narrator's unique profession and emotional state, creating a distinct and memorable narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, elevated fairytale tone. The primary weakness is an over-reliance on filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew," "he realized") that create psychic distance and dull the immediacy of key moments. This narrative filtering prevents a full immersion into the character's perceptual signature, making the voice feel more observational than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. However, the narrative voice is functional rather than distinct, often relying on filter-like constructions ("Aria's thoughts were interrupted," "Aria's mind began to wander") that create distance. While the prose has lyrical moments, it lacks a unique perceptual signature that would fully immerse the reader in Aria's specific way of seeing and processing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is stable and the elevated, almost mythic voice is consistently maintained. However, the narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the prose describes Aria and her journey from an observational distance rather than immersing the reader in her specific "realistically imaginative" worldview. The result is a voice that feels more like a generic, lyrical narrator than the unique perspective of the character herself, keeping the reader at an emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the lyrical, elevated voice is consistently maintained, effectively establishing the story's tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature focused on cosmic patterns and ethereal beauty. However, the voice lacks rhythmic variety, often settling into a monotonous cadence of long, descriptive sentences that could benefit from more modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person POV is stable, and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical, and serene tone appropriate for the subject matter. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on the carver's internal experience. The prose has a distinct texture, but it occasionally lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, sometimes slipping into a more generic "literary" voice rather than one specific to this character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is technically stable, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Elara's interiority is often expressed in an overly formal, analytical register that feels detached from her supposed emotional turmoil. The prose has a consistent, stately rhythm but lacks the specificity and texture that would create a memorable, character-particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice. The narrative distance is effective for the contemplative tone. The prose texture is distinct, though it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing like "ethereal glow" and "otherworldly energy," which softens the specificity of the otherwise unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and elevated, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The prose texture is monotonous, and the verbatim repetition of key phrases ("groundedly imaginative," "kingfisher feather quill nib") feels mechanical and unnatural. While consistent, the voice fails to create a unique or compelling character consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice. The narrative stance is effective in building a mist-shrouded, mysterious mood. The voice is slightly diminished by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "thistled calm," which feels more like an authorial imposition than an organic part of the character's internal lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic literary prose, relying on abstract emotional labels ("inexplicable connection," "deeper understanding"). The dialogue is the primary weakness; it's stilted, overly articulate, and serves as undisguised exposition. Both characters share the same formal, thematic voice, lacking individual distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent, if somewhat formal and overwrought, voice appropriate for a "wannabe philosopher." However, the voice lacks dynamism and relies on recycling key phrases ("rationally rebellious," "competing narratives," "sunken city ruins"), which creates a monotonous texture. This repetition flattens the voice, making it feel more like a constructed persona than a specific, living consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, formal tone. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a disembodied narrator describing Emilia's feelings rather than inhabiting her specific consciousness. The language is elevated but feels generic to the "sensitive artist" archetype, not particular to this individual.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a stable, lyrical quality appropriate for a modern fable. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on familiar archetypes ("whispers of the past," "fabric of time") rather than a character-specific way of seeing. The psychic distance remains large, creating a sense of detachment that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting Aria's profound experience.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice maintains a stable, if somewhat generic, descriptive tone. The dialogue is functional, primarily serving to move the plot forward through exposition. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the toll keeper's internal experience beyond simple observation and summary.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent, maintaining a gentle, lyrical tone throughout. The prose has a distinct, if sometimes overwrought, texture. The narrative stance effectively conveys Eli's sense of wonder and curiosity. There are no technical flaws like POV shifts or psychic distance errors, but the voice doesn't achieve a truly memorable or unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a steady, fable-like quality that suits the material. The prose, however, often falls into a repetitive syntactic rhythm, with many sentences following a "The [noun] [verb]..." structure. This creates a monotonous cadence that detracts from the voice's potential distinctiveness and lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    The first-person voice is consistent in its philosophical, slightly detached tone, fitting the character's intellectual nature. POV is stable and psychic distance is well-controlled. The prose has a distinct, though somewhat uniform, rhythm. While effective, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally feeling more like a vehicle for concepts than the expression of a particular, idiosyncratic mind.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's contemplative mood. The prose has a distinct texture, and the narrator's perception is appropriately filtered through her artistic sensibility. However, the psychic distance sometimes feels inconsistent, shifting between close, embodied feeling and more detached summary of her thoughts and memories, slightly flattening the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is clean but relies on formal, reportorial language and filter verbs ("Elena felt") that distance the reader from the experience. The voice reads as a functional container for the plot rather than an expressive instrument of character.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic storyteller than the specific mind of a "counter clockwise clock maker." The most significant flaw is the repetitive sentence structure, particularly the overuse of "As he..." and "The clock maker's..." as sentence starters. This syntactic monotony creates a mechanical rhythm that flattens the prose, especially during moments of discovery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The first-person POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice is tonally appropriate for a gothic horror piece. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to a generic narrator for the genre. While functional, it doesn't possess the unique texture in rhythm or word choice that would elevate it from competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone appropriate for the material. The prose has a distinct rhythm. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly particular perceptual signature; it feels more like a generalized poetic narrator than the specific, idiosyncratic filter of the "Leeward tide prophet." The story avoids major flaws but doesn't achieve a truly memorable or unique voice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the narrative voice is consistent. However, the voice lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes leaning on repetitive sentence structures to convey Lyra's thoughts and feelings (e.g., multiple "Lyra felt..." constructions). While functional and clear, the prose texture isn't as unique as the story's concept.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.5)
    Point of view is stable and technically correct, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose often slips into an abstract, expository register to explain concepts ("deliberate distortions of truth") or summarize action ("she worked to reconstruct the events"). This creates a narrative distance that prevents immediacy and keeps the character's experience at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic literary style than a specific character's consciousness. Repetitive sentence structures ("The structure...", "The stillness...", "The inkwell...") create a monotonous rhythm that flattens the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling more descriptive than experiential. The prose has an elevated, slightly generic quality, and the repetition of key phrases ("reclaimed stillness," "tranquilly perceptive") makes the voice feel less like a unique character's and more like a narrative fulfilling its own thematic keywords.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more as a detached, elegant authorial voice than an expression of Kaito's specific mind. The vocabulary and sentence structure feel somewhat generic for the literary fantasy genre, missing an opportunity to build a truly unique and character-bound voice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained on Amira. However, the narrative voice is generic and relies heavily on abstract nouns and slightly overwrought phrasing ("intangibly tangible essence," "otherworldly energy"). This creates a uniform, detached tone that fails to capture a unique perceptual signature for a character undergoing such extreme trauma and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical competence and consistency. However, the narrative voice is largely generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would align with the character's stated profession as a "sharp-eyed drone pilot." The prose effectively conveys information but does not possess a unique rhythm or texture to make the voice memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the melancholic voice is tonally consistent, the execution is hampered by a repetitive sentence structure. The pervasive use of "She [verb]..." as a sentence stem creates a mechanical rhythm and psychic distance. This template cadence undermines the otherwise literary quality of the prose and flattens the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a distinct voice for the negotiator—formal, contemplative, and slightly detached. The psychic distance is stable and appropriate for the character's professional role. The single passage of dialogue, a "low, furrowed hush," aligns perfectly with the established narrative voice, maintaining the story's cohesive, atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often lapsing into generic, abstract language to describe Jack's internal state ("gravitating towards a new sense of purpose"). The prose is clear but doesn't modulate significantly with Jack's emotional shifts, maintaining a somewhat detached, descriptive tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose often feels like a somewhat detached narrator describing Lena's feelings rather than filtering the world through her unique, "jaded" consciousness. Word choices like "ethereal," "otherworldly," and "inexplicable" create a generic sense of wonder, missing an opportunity to ground the voice in a more character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is mostly stable, and the lyrical voice is consistent with the fairy-tale tone. However, the narration frequently slips into a more distant, explanatory register, using abstract labels ("reluctant metamorphosis," "paradoxically steady," "cosmic intimacy") that feel like authorial pronouncements rather than authentic parts of Lyra's internal experience. This creates a psychic distance that flattens the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control and consistent psychic distance. The voice is lyrical and elevated, fitting the mystical subject matter, and possesses a distinct, rhythmic texture. The narrator's perceptual signature is clear, filtering the world through a lens of symbolism and metaphor ("The crack seemed to mirror the fractures in her own understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is controlled and the narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an ethereal and gentle tone that fits the character. The prose has a distinct, if sometimes familiar, lyrical texture. The psychic distance is stable and appropriate for the intimate, internal nature of the conflict, creating a cohesive reading experience without technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose aims for a lyrical, mysterious tone but often falls into generic "literary" phrasing ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "ethereal glow," "texture of transformation"). While the voice is stable, it feels more like a curated aesthetic than the authentic internal world of a specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with a stable psychic distance and a formal, fitting narrative voice. There are no technical errors like head-hopping. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the prose feels more like a competent, detached narration of events rather than a deep filtering through this specific character's unique mind and biases under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    The distant, mythic third-person voice is consistent and well-suited to the story's tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture. The primary weakness is a degree of syntactic monotony and repetitive phrasing, with certain sentence structures and descriptions recurring in a way that slightly flattens the voice over the course of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone. However, the perceptual signature feels somewhat generic for a poet; it describes concepts and emotions more than it filters the world through a uniquely textured consciousness. The prose is controlled, but it lacks the idiosyncratic rhythm and diction that would make the voice truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its formal, elevated tone, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature particular to Aurélien. The prose relies on filter verbs ("he realized," "he knew") that create distance, and the overall voice feels more like a dispassionate narrator describing the philosopher than the philosopher's own way of seeing and processing the world under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the lyrical voice is maintained throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, often feeling like a generalized "poetic" register rather than the specific worldview of this unique character. The prose is controlled but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing that slightly flattens the voice's potential for originality.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the dreamlike setting and the protagonist's artistic sensibility. The narrative distance is well-controlled, modulating effectively between external description and internal feeling. While the prose texture is distinct, some of the phrasing occasionally drifts toward familiar lyrical constructions ("fireflies on a summer's night"), slightly diluting the voice's unique signature.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical quality that fits the fantasy setting. However, it sometimes drifts into a slightly distant, authorial register with abstract phrasing like "empirically whimsical" and "luminous doubt," which feel imposed on the character rather than emerging organically from her internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, and the calm, deliberate voice is consistent with the character of a "slow-spoken bonsai tutor." Psychic distance is stable. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; its observations and rhythms, while pleasant, feel somewhat generic and don't achieve a unique texture that would elevate the piece to a higher literary standard.


== Grader: Grok 4 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person POV is stable with consistent distance, but voice lacks distinct perceptual signature, modulating into repetitive abstract phrasing under reflection; no dialogue present, and syntax remains uniform without rhythmic variation to heighten emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in noticing frost and stars, but diction drifts into elevated register like "drifting resonance" that clashes with the artist's practical craft background. Prose texture is poetic with rhythmic control in descriptive passages, yet syntactic uniformity in "She felt" openings undercuts propulsion under stress. No dialogue present, so no evaluation there; elision in reflective blocks is taught but pays off weakly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward solace and creativity, though elision of catastrophe details is purposeful but minimally paid off. Prose texture in rhythmic descriptions like "ripples on a pond" modulates with intensity, but lacks distinct idiom for Eli's silence. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, but psychic distance shifts feel unmotivated in reflective blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable with consistent close-third distance, perceptual signature biased toward weariness and purpose, as in pondering the note's pull. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, reflective syntax, modulating with intensity during descent, though no dialogue appears to evaluate. Minor elision in time jumps is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV on Akira is stable and modest, with perceptual bias in noticing community faces and lantern light; voice texture uses rhythmic repetition like "soft chime" effectively for accumulative buildup. Dialogue in Akira's speech feels natural and goal-driven, advancing solidarity with subtext of determination. Some register drift into elevated diction like "beacon of hope" clashes slightly with the quiet tone, but psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward mystical ambiance like ethereal light, and prose texture in rhythmic, flowing syntax suits the foggy lucidity. Dialogue is hushed and goal-driven, advancing the healing via subtext in the pilgrim's resonant words, though brief. Purposeful compression in the pilgrim's fading is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register like "conduit for the divine" that feels slightly unmotivated for Aria's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward curiosity and earth-toned details, modulating rhythm in descriptive builds without head-hopping. Voice texture is distinct in flowing, sensory syntax, but some elisions like sudden image appearance feel untaught. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean. Under pressure, diction compresses appropriately, but peak beats show minor register drift into abstract terms like "metaphysical odyssey."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.7)

Prose has a poetic cadence, but syntactic monotony and register drift into abstract lyricism clash with the destitute philanthropist's plausible lexicon. Elision is minimal and untaught, with no purposeful compression to heighten the encounter.

No dialogue or head-hopping, but elision of figure's identity pays off intentionally without withholding known facts.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and modest, with perceptions biased toward mystical elements like ozone scent and aurora glow, but diction drifts into elevated, academic register (e.g., "precognitively cursed nature stirred") mismatched to the herder's elusive idiom. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, flowing syntax that modulates with deliberation, yet patterned repetition feels untaught and occasionally obscures under stress. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; elision of action details is purposeful but pays off legibly at the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward poetic turbulence and a distinct rhythmic texture in swirling syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person POV remains stable with a poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, reflecting the focalizer's perceptual bias toward luminous defiance; prose modulates with emotional intensity, but occasional register drift into abstract phrasing like "molting personalities" feels unmotivated, slightly dulling immediacy at peak hope surges.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyrical voice is distinct with rhythmic, mist-swirled prose modulating emotional intensity, perceptual signature biased toward melancholy and creativity; POV is stable single-focalizer with no head-hopping or unmotivated elision.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with perceptual bias toward whimsical interpretations, and prose texture uses rhythmic, patterned diction that suits the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in slow, deliberate noticing of natural rhythms matching Kaito's placid attribute. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, flowing syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, like murmuring instructions during weaving. Patterned elision in reflective shards is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.

    Third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature shows Lena’s whimsical selectivity (“prismatic quiet”). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and no POV leakage occurs. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited stays consistent, but the narrative voice leans lyrical-generic (“vineyard hush,” “mystical energy”) rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tight to the conscience; perceptual signature is consistent in its cool, slightly sardonic detachment. Syntax modulates with scene rhythm—longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for the final descent.

    Third-person limited stays consistent; diction is controlled and occasionally lyrical (“ink wilts near dishonesty”). Repetition of “gilded-leaf” and “candor” edges toward template cadence, preventing a sharper voice signature.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled cadence and selective sensory detail. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Diction remains within Aria’s contemplative register; slight poetic inflation (“symphonies of truth”) is motif-consistent. Perceptual signature is present but generalized; stronger idiosyncrasy could heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays close to Aria’s selective perception—measured, horticultural, then sensorily overwhelmed. Syntax mirrors her precision under stress: short clauses during containment, longer breaths in aftermath. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on consistent diction and perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited stays consistent, but the narrative voice is bland and reportorial. Sensory filtering is present yet generic; no idiosyncratic perceptual signature distinguishes Emilia.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic, sensory diction that mirrors Aria’s dancerly cognition. Occasional elevated phrasing (“otherworldly light”) edges toward poetic overlay, yet the perceptual signature stays distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical compression that suits the Accumulative/Textural lens. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; rhythm modulates with descent into tunnels.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is lush, consistent, and lyrically textured; perceptual signature favors mournful synesthesia (“velvet garden,” “mournful serenade”). However, the elevated register drifts toward poetic generality under pressure, and no dialogue tests voice distinctiveness. Compression and elision are not taught early, so some lines read padded.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature favors synesthetic light and scent. No dialogue, so compression and rhythm carry the beat. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly energy”) edges toward purple but remains within the forger’s reverent register.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually filtered through Aria’s heightened senses. Syntax modulates with intensity—short pulses during vision, longer cadences in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-anchored. Rhythm modulates with mood; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“scintillatingly somber”) feels slightly self-conscious but stays within tolerable range.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Aria’s sharply observant filter; diction is consistent and purposeful. No dialogue, so voice is carried by interiority and sensory selection. Rhythm remains steady, neither monotonous nor showy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lyric third-person voice is consistent, with rhythmic control and selective metaphor (“gritty whimsy,” “cobalt glass”). Perceptual signature is more atmospheric than character-specific; the visionary’s inner diction merges with the narrator’s. No dialogue or head-hopping issues; compression is purposeful, though occasional poetic abstractions edge toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually biased toward the poet’s red-wine fatigue. Syntax modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor”) risks ornament but remains within character.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lyric yet precise: “fleshly ethereal” is embodied in ice-creak, gull-cry, hum. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for immersion, clipped fragments at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually anchored to the mapper. Syntax modulates with rising hum and wind. Occasional elevated diction (“unyoke themselves,” “patient revolution”) edges toward editorial rather than lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is consistent, sensory, and textured; perceptual signature is strong (“thick with the scent of damp earth and decay”). No dialogue to test, but internal cadence modulates with emotional intensity. Minor drift into therapeutic phrasing near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is consistent, gentle, ecclesiastical; free of head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional crests, though occasional elevated diction (“vibrant hush”) feels slightly self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Luna’s perceptual signature is restrained, lyrical, consistent in focalization. Prose avoids therapy-speak and maintains clean psychic distance; “dove gray map case” returns without strain. Voice never falters yet also never escalates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is consistent, hushed, and slightly archaic without slipping. Sensory filtering is character-specific: dust, parchment, ink. Rhythm modulates with the hush-to-footsteps shift. No dialogue to test distinction; interior monologue avoids filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is hushed, tidal, and consistent; patterned repetition (“the fog swirled… the fog closed in”) teaches its rhythm early and pays off in closure.

Distinct perceptual signature sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Emilia’s perceptual bias; free-indirect style is clean. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “dynamic balance”) momentarily lifts out of her plausible lexicon, but the slip is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    Narrative voice is consistently lyrical without head-hop; metaphors (tidal obsidian, brass heartbeat) are apt for a solitary technician’s heightened perception. Repetition of “pendulum bob resumed its swing” and similar cadences borders on template but stays within acceptable range for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric; perceptual signature favors tactile and olfactory detail. Occasional elevated diction (“velveteen gloom,” “celestial map”) feels ornamental rather than character-bound, keeping it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature favors texture over event. No head-hopping. Dialogue is spare and subtextual, though Eli’s lines verge on authorial commentary. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no filter-verb clutter. Distinctive but not yet fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, intellectually compressed, and textured—“abrasive calm” is maintained through controlled syntax and selective sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person privative slips elegantly via synesthetic focus: the prose tastes the past in textures. Syntax and diction stay lush without clogging momentum; only intermittent drifting toward elevated exposition mildly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person narration is stable and unobtrusive. Diction is clean, rhythms varied, but voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature. Dialogue is serviceable yet interchangeable; no idiom or cadence marks either speaker.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elena’s curator’s gaze—“cultured,” precise, slightly elegiac. No dialogue appears, so the burden falls on narrative texture, which sustains a hushed, reverent cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“rosewater dread”) risks register drift but stays within Elena’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited stays consistent, but diction drifts into elevated register (“unfulfilled longing,” “otherworldly light”) that clashes with the POV’s artisan pragmatism. No perceptual signature beyond generic curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is atmospheric and consistent, with a gothic cadence that suits the funhouse. However, heavy reliance on stock phrases (“siren’s call,” “black as coal”) flattens the perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent lyrical voice but generic perceptual signature—glass artist notices no light/refraction specifics, only universal "frost patterns." Rhythm remains uniformly flowing under pressure, missing stress-induced compression; "drifting resonance" repetitions dilute distinctness despite clean POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV voice maintains consistent lyrical texture ("beauty preserved like a delicate flower in ice"), but emotional descriptions default to abstract labels ("sense of peace," "depth of emotions") during pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "frayed twine" and "luminescent creatures" reveals the undertaker's occupation-tuned attention; minor register drift in "inexplicable pull" momentarily fractures voice during high-pressure decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable with lyrical consistency, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—details like "warm orange glow" feel curated, not filtered through Akira's urgent priorities. Emotional descriptions ("spirit renewed") default to generic phrasing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("spiritually curious" lens colors wisteria as "tiny stars") and rhythmic control shine, but pilgrim's dialogue lacks voice distinction (both speak in hushed, lyrical cadence). Register drift: "respiration," "conduit for the divine" feel academic, not character-particular. No head-hopping; elision of past life memory taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong perceptual signature ("dappled shadows," "vibrant life") but filter-verb stacks ("Elian felt," "began to grasp") dull climax immediacy. Register drift with academic terms ("retrocognitively trapped") violates POV lexicon. Rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beat via template cadence ("As they [verb], [subject] [verb]").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV stable but voice flattens under pressure: "heart swelled with purpose" uses therapy-speak over embodied perception. No character-specific perceptual signature; descriptions remain touristy ("faint scent of sugar").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("golden light" of mother's voice) and rhythmic control under pressure, though "battered marvel" repetition creates minor scaffold in high-stakes closure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct lyrical voice but "luminous disbelief" repetition creates scaffold. Perceptual signature strong (light-focused POV), yet uniform stress cadence: "faintest whisper... faintest hint" dilutes tension. No dialogue to test subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice has distinct textural rhythm ("soft clink... gentle hum"), but stress flattens perception—no degradation under pressure. Perceptual signature shines in glassblowing details, yet "soulful brown" eyes revert to stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Register drift into clinical jargon ("firmly adaptive nature," "phobia-ridden") mid-crisis undermines authenticity. Consistent POV but interiority lacks character-specific texture—generic "tremble in hands" cliché. Rhythmic control weakens during decryption ("As I worked... After hours...") with repetitive stems.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("words dripped like honey") and rhythmic control elevate tension. Voice modulates flawlessly with emotional intensity; elision (no dialogue) taught early and paid off in closure’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Robotic precision ("methodically swept," "soft whir") establishes voice but flattens under pressure—no modulation during epiphany. Template cadence in loop descriptions ("In one loop... In another") creates rhythmic monotony. Consistent POV but emotional intensity static despite high-stakes realization.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV voice is lyrical but overwrought ("resonant hush," "ambiguously clear" repeated 3x). Perceptual signature shows registrar’s bias yet flattens under pressure—no syntactic shift during climax. No dialogue, but interiority avoids therapy-speak despite thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct musician’s perceptual signature (noticing unstruck chords, viola vibrations) anchors voice, but rhythm stagnates in mid-section with repetitive "as" constructions. Avoids dialogue pitfalls but overuses filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines (data streams filtered through oracle's precision), with rhythmic control sustaining lyrical compression; minor register drift in "auroral sorrow" repetitions slightly dulls pressure during fever-break clarity moments.

    POV voice captures sensory decay well, but "drowsy alertness" and "conceptual repricing" intrude with clinical diction. Radio dialogue feels like exposition, not character-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV voice is distinct: keeper's "cryptic folds" perception shapes diction ("veins of crystal whispered secrets"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via origami swan metaphors. Tension in "reality unravel" phrasing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV voice is lyrical but overwrites with generic metaphors ("stars twinkling like diamonds"); compression works early but collapses under pressure with therapy-speak ("cautious exuberance"), diluting Aria’s distinct perceptual signature during the eclipse peak.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive nature," tactile handling of relics) with rhythmic control; "bronze quiet" refrain modulates intensity, though "whispers of forgotten tales" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent lyrical cadence sustains POV, but "familiar enigma" repetition becomes tic; dialogue absent, so voice distinction bullet irrelevant, yet over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("mystery," "enigma") dulls perceptual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.3)
    Consistent poetic voice but filter-verb stacks ("awareness was acute," "seemed to hold") dilute immediacy. Elevated diction ("sonic landscape," "plumb depths") clashes with character perspective, lacking a distinct perceptual signature under ritual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct poetic texture ("topography of memories") with rhythmic control, but register drifts into pretentious abstraction ("conductor of unheard symphonies") uncharacteristic for a fortune cookie writer. Perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—no evidence of how trade shapes noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable with poetic diction, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—generic phrases like "scent of wet earth" don't reflect the gravity defier's unique psyche. Under pressure, syntax stays uniformly elevated without stress-induced compression, diluting immediacy during high-stakes moments like confronting echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers danced across drum surface", "voice barely audible") maintains consistent sensory bias; rhythmic control modulates beautifully from meditation to "insistent" humming climax.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elevated diction ("progressing laterally," "intuit") breaches storm recorder's plausible lexicon under stress. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she couldn't shake") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats, weakening perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Capped per Orientation penalty. Distinct perceptual signature ("aromatically cautious," light-focused diction) shines, but rhythmic control falters in grief beat with repetitive "Elara felt..." phrasing. Single POV stable, yet clinical motivation statement ("to understand why...") jars voice during peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "air vibrated with whispers of the past" and "ethically playful grin," with rhythmic control in sentence cadence. Minor register drift in "conceptual or social cost" phrasing, but no head-hopping and consistent lyrical compression taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("acoustically perceptive" shown via vibration descriptions) shines. However, "chronic hush" repetition creates template cadence in high-pressure beats, dulling momentum toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature (scent-focused, tactile diction) sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in crafting sequence ("weave emotions together") avoids lyric drift. Zero head-hopping; voice modulation impeccable during dusk transition.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV control strong with Lena's sensory selectivity (book textures, sea whispers), but "whimsically attentive" is diagnostic label without perceptual signature. Dialogue lacks subtext—"I think that might be mine" states intent plainly—and voice convergence flattens distinction between Lena/Sophia during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("luminescent ache," kinship webs") sustains voice, but stress compression under pressure is muted—tag discovery uses uniform lyrical diction without tactical diction shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("serpentine waterway," "water's gentle song") modulates with time dilation. Minor register drift in "insatiable drive" disrupts Lyra's voice during peak pressure, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("branches etched like pen and ink drawing") with rhythmic control, though minor register drifts ("deep-seated desire") undercut voice consistency under ritual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)

    Distinct perceptual signature in botanical details but uniform tics during stress ("felt determination wash over her"); no head-hopping but psychic distance flattens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Painter’s perceptual signature shines in texture-focused noticing ("intricate patterns dance"), but abstract emotional labels ("haggard awe") disrupt embodied voice during peak pressure with the stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (vibrational attunement) and rhythmic control matching mystical tone; stress compresses diction without voice leakage. Pilgrim's dialogue feels natural yet sparse, avoiding character convergence. No head-hopping, and lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in artifact observation, but emotional peaks use clinical labels ("reactively visionary") violating POV lexicon; no head-hopping but stress response lacks syntactic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV lacks route mapper’s perceptual signature—no professional bias in noticing (e.g., mapping terrain). Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats, but rhythmic control avoids uniform tics. Tense remains stable though voice lacks modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in sea-tuned details ("melody harmonized with patterns on the tile"), but peak moments lapse into abstract lyricism ("alchemy of memory transformed the mundane"). Whale song’s "unheard symphony" motif sustains voice consistency without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice has strong textural specificity ("prismatic escondite," "dimensionally aware"), but perceptual signature lacks character bias—Kael’s observations ("colors danced") remain tourist-catalog generic under pressure, missing 9+ rhythmic control.

    Distinct perceptual signature in Lena’s tactile focus ("cradled," "turned over") and math metaphors; rhythm modulates with tension. Voice stays within POV lexicon, though "liquefy rigid thinking" slightly drifts into abstraction during high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "charting hum" and "refracting light" shows character-particular noticing. However, passive observations ("forest came alive") dilute POV confidence during peak texture-capturing moments.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV consistency is strong, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—"texture of memories" is generic abstraction. Under stress, no rhythmic compression; lyrical cadence remains uniform ("footsteps echoed... rhythm of tides") dulling pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong lyrical rhythm falters in focalization: prose asserts objective reality of "ghosts" rather than filtered perception. Psychic distance shifts (e.g., omniscient "she felt the atmosphere begin to shift") lack justification, undermining POV consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stable single-POV voice lacks distinct texture; rhythmic uniformity ("Ava, with her...") dulls pressure. Perceptual signature absent—descriptions reflect generic observer, not culture shock absorber's professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong lunar-specific diction but filter-verb stacks ("her gaze scanning," "eyes were fixed") dull immediacy. Register drift occurs when technical role clashes with poetic abstractions like "dawning hush" in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinct poetic voice but uniform tics under pressure ("mist-coated," "beacon of tranquility"). Filter-verb stacks ("Emilia watched – not with her eyes, but with her entire being") dull immediacy during high-stakes calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong lyrical texture ("lonesome splendor," "gathered hush") with consistent perceptual signature, but voice lacks pressure modulation—identical cadence during high-stakes work and reflection dulls immediacy. Single POV stable but authorial tone overrides character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.7)
    Strong lyrical texture but filter-verb saturation ("could feel," "began to notice") dulls immediacy. Perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias—POV notices generic "scuffs" and "whispers" without professional or emotional selectivity. Register drifts into abstract diction during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV voice shines in concrete perceptual details ("sandalwood scent," "shiver down spine"), but abstract labels ("bittersweet mixture") fracture lexical consistency under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile weaving details ("needle dancing," "threads weaving of its own accord"), but over-reliance on lyrical cadence creates template stems ("As she worked...").

    Distinct perceptual signature ("primordial aroma that resonated deeply within Aria") and rhythmic control under pressure; elision of letter authors' identities taught early and paid off in the manifestation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("shrewdly innocent wonder," translator's pattern-seeking); rhythmic control deepens under stress, though "lotus-hearted ache" momentarily fractures lexicon plausibility for a translator mid-anesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("vivid mural artist roamed, seeking inspiration") shows selective artist's noticing. Minor psychic distance slip in "Lena paints with light" repetition disrupts rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature (artist's sensory focus on color/vibration) shines, but "itch to bewitch reality" is clichéd. Filter verbs ("Lena felt") slightly dull immediacy during high-pressure beats, though rhythmic control in sound-wave descriptions sustains tension. No POV leaks, but stress moments lack syntactic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV stable but generic; "converging chaos" lacks character-specific perceptual signature. Syntax flattens under pressure ("As [time], Lyra [verb]") with no rhythmic modulation. "Candidly cryptic" trait never manifests in distinctive diction or thought patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong perceptual signature ("off-key wind") but academic register drift ("photosynthesize") in peak beats. Filter-verb stack in closure ("knew that she would continue") dulls immediacy despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct lyrical voice ("velvety softness of foxglove regret") but perceptual signature isn’t character-particular—uniformly ornate regardless of action.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice has strong textural rhythm ("flickering light of luminescent orbs cast eerie shadows"), but register drift occurs when "interconnected promises" and "symphonies of truth" inject academic diction mid-crisis, clashing with a linguist's plausible lexicon during high-pressure transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in volcanic atmosphere, but "dappled resolve" and "tremble" become repetitive tics under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction; lyrical compression taught early pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature (paper scent/dust motes) with rhythmic control; no head-hopping, but "bittersweet sensation" risks over-abstracted interiority in peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in wood-grain analysis; rhythmic control during prism shifts avoids syntactic monotony, though reflection fragments slightly dilute present-moment urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    Distinct lyrical voice but "shadowseam wonder" repetition creates artificial rhythm. Perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; every detail serves theme, not astrologer's expertise. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (light/refraction focus) and rhythmic control anchor voice. However, filter-verb stacks ("Her eyes wandered... She felt...") proliferate during urgency beat, violating stress-compression principle. Psychic distance remains stable but diction lacks modulation under pressure—no short-term syntax tightening when "sense of urgency" peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent lyrical voice but perceptual signature lacks firefighter-specific urgency (e.g., terrain hazards ignored for celestial observation); rhythmic control falters with repetitive "Kael's [noun]" stems diluting embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice modulates well under pressure ("exhilarating and terrifying"), but "lucidly watchful" and "serene upheaval" are therapy-speak intrusions. Perceptual signature strong yet diction drifts into academic ("conceptual repricing" implied).

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent atmospheric voice but slips into abstraction ("sensitively perceptive nature," "deep sense of loss"). Perceptual signature lacks specificity—no unique cartographer POV in noticing echoes. Final paragraph’s overwritten lyricism ("journey had come full circle") dilutes pressure without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("dusky harmony," "kaleidoscope of colors") with rhythmic control, but minor POV leaks ("mirrors seemed to stir" unfiltered through her senses). "Perceptively calm" label disrupts interiority; no dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV leaks into omniscient ("delegates departed, their faces etched...") and authorial intrusion ("flawed beauty"). Syntactic monotony in opening cadence ("As [X], [Y] stood...") creates drumbeat rhythm. Register drift: "operatively gentle" clashes with negotiator's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinct lyrical voice shines in snow imagery ("delicate flakes danced") with consistent perceptual bias toward light. However, peak stress moments ("surge of energy... exhilarating and terrifying") maintain uniform elevated diction without compression, missing opportunity for voice modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose exhibits lyrical consistency but generic phrasing ("brightened disquiet", "mind expanding") lacks character-particular perceptual signature. Under stress, curator maintains unnaturally calm, articulate interiority without degradation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.5)
    POV leaks omniscient observations ("the very fabric of reality resonating") impossible for Elara to perceive. Time traveler's introduction uses "revealing a time traveler"—knowledge breach violating focalization rules.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV consistency holds, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—"blissfully aberrant" tells rather than shows Lyra’s unique cognition. Voice modulates weakly under pressure; high-stakes moments ("shiver down her spine") default to generic phrasing. No head-hopping, yet compression of memory blurring feels untaught for the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Perceptual signature shines in archivist details (diplomat’s seal, rope textures) but diction drifts into academic abstraction during tension ("conceptual cost," "clear complexity").

    Distinct perceptual signature ("ashen charcoal," "dark tentacles") modulates with pressure, yet tense shifts ("had dulled," "reached out") create inconsistent psychic distance. Voice cohesion frays during high-stakes moments where diction turns abstract ("paradox that lay at the heart of their existence").

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    Filter-verb stacks proliferate in pressure beats ("Lyra felt... she knew... she suspected"). Perceptual signature blurs—mushroom farm descriptions lack character-particular bias. "Virtuously mischievous" repetition creates uniform tics without rhythmic modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ink-stained fingers," "reverent touch") and rhythmic control elevate lyric mode. Single-POV stability holds despite experimental elements; "first yawn of evening" establishes voice without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "whispering trees" and "tang of mystical experimentation" but collapses under stress with uniform "shimmering entity" abstractions. No head-hopping but psychic distance flattens during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature (dust patterns, tactile archiving) shines early but collapses into abstraction. Register drift in climax ("enduring power of human heart") violates Emilia's plausible lexicon. Consistent psychic distance otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct lyrical voice sustains Accumulative lens through "coded freedom" motifs and sensory precision. Minor register drift in "crusade against apathy" slightly over-articulates internal state for mid-crisis reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice has distinct lyrical rhythm ("dewdrops form on lush vegetation"), but psychic distance slips into omniscient description ("as if the very mist itself is remembering"), violating single-POV consistency during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("lunar light," "whispers of past") sustains voice, but "thrill of mossy delight" shows register drift into forced idiom during high-pressure decoding beat, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in tinkerer's tactile observations ("worn hands," "gears and springs"), though rhythmic control falters during reflection; consistent Accumulative lens avoids head-hopping but over-relies on "scent of damp earth" refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist's material/mystical duality) sustains voice, but "luminous regret" recurs as unearned label-speak, flattening emotional complexity under pressure in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV voice shines with lyrical precision ("hush of a hidden sunrise," whispers of restless dead"), though "luminous ache" jars as academic diction. Perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure, avoiding emotional ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV consistency falters under stress: clinical terms ("proprioceptively enhanced") clash with poetic abstractions ("displaced rooted-ness"). Filter-verb stacks ("her eyes snapped open, and she was met") dull immediacy during high-pressure restraint struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct "resonant hush" refrain creates perceptual signature, though filter-verbs dilute immediacy during compass vision. Rhythmic control maintains voice coherence through mystical climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice consistently lyrical but lacks Aria's perceptual signature—overuse of abstract phrases ("scaffold complexity," "layered meanings") distances focalization. Prose modulates rhythm well during storm but flattens into thematic assertion at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory details ("whispering forests," "etched glass glinting"), yet repeated abstract phrases like "dawning hush" dilute POV consistency during high-pressure reflection beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature absent—both women speak in uniformly poetic diction ("weaving threads of history"). Register drift in "tension between revelation and secrecy was palpable" introduces diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct lyrical voice with consistent perceptual signature (sensory/mystical focus), but elevated diction ("furiously tranquil") persists uniformly under peak stress without compression. No head-hopping; spatial choreography clean. Minor flaw: academic jargon ("entropy") clashes with poetic register during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature (wind-as-symphony) but POV breaches occur with off-page "people of the sanctuary" reverence. Filter verbs dilute immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    Uniform "janitor felt..." cadence creates syntactic monotony; no perceptual signature beyond generic awe ("twinkled like diamonds"). Voice modulates poorly—reflection intensity matches calm sweeping, not peak pressure. Fails 9+ test: no rhythmic control under pressure (none exists).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory filtering ("air reeked of decay," "faint hum filled the air"), though "tranquilly perceptive eyes" drifts into abstract labeling under peak stress during box opening.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV consistency anchors coachman's perception, yet "submerged concord" intrudes as abstract concept rather than character-particular thought. Over-reliance on passive constructions ("was known to speak," "began to fertilize") dulls immediacy during action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV consistent with bloodhound sensory focus ("nose twitching"), but human emotions bleed into canine perspective ("Kael felt belonging"). "An surge" grammatical error disrupts voice. No dialogue to test subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice shows distinct perceptual signature in star-sketching details and rhythmic control ("stars twinkling like diamonds"), though "temporally stretched existence" drifts into clinical diction during high stress.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Repetitive syntax ("Aria felt...") creates drumbeat rhythm under pressure. "Factually mystical" violates POV lexicon with corporate diction. Filter-verb stack ("felt herself float... carried... pulled") dulls immediacy in high-stakes mapping sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "whispers of the sands," yet syntax uniformity under pressure ("As the turner worked... As the truth began...") creates template cadence. Voice modulates well except for intrusive "quietly inspired" assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal fingers," "silver hush") persists under pressure, though stress degrades syntax insufficiently. Single-POV stability and rhythmic control elevate, but late repetition of "sense of peace" dulls closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("polished the emerald chip... searching for hidden patterns"), but peak-beat syntax flattens ("Aria's fingers moved... Aria felt... Aria smiled"). Compression is purposeful, yet "threshold of stillness" repetitions dull rhythmic control during critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV interiority relies on therapy-speak ("deep understanding of their needs," "sense of peace") rather than character-specific perceptual bias; rhythmic monotony in "Aria felt... Aria realized..." stems undermines voice distinctness during contemplative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in chime/mirror descriptions, but "sincerely insincere" recurs as a tic without stress-induced diction shifts; psychic distance remains static during the high-pressure unhooking beat, diluting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV control is stable with distinct meditative rhythm, but "felt a surge of determination" etc. repetitions create template cadence under pressure. Perceptual signature weakens during high-tension beats with generic interiority phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature in brook/seed imagery, but academic diction ("orthogonal approaches") clashes with proprietor’s voice. Filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy ("she felt," "she believed") during high-pressure reflection.

    Strong lyric rhythm and sensory filtering through carver's POV, but "fiercely meditative" and "thundering calm" verge on stock phrasing. Consistent voice modulates well with emotional intensity despite minor register drift in "sweet scent of blooming flowers" cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature strong (clock mechanics, weathered textures) but rhythmic control falters in reflection blocks; filter verbs ("she felt") dull immediacy during pivotal discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature (scent of aged dust, starlight glow) sustains voice, though high-pressure beats lack rhythmic compression; no head-hopping but diction remains uniformly poetic under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent lyrical voice with distinctive "groundedly imaginative" phrasing, but fails under pressure: high-stakes writing beat lacks syntactic compression or stress-driven diction shifts. Perceptual signature is selective yet static, never modulating with rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("thistled calm," "mist-shrouded atmosphere") modulates rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping, though passive constructions ("dust motes began to swirl") dilute immediacy in high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines (Lena’s tactile focus on powder/ash), but dialogue flattens under stress—Eli’s lines read as thematic mouthpiece. Rhythmic control falters in reflection blocks; "weaves truth carefully" violates POV lexicon. No head-hopping, yet stress compression lacks syntactic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature (decay-focused, tactile objects) but register drifts into academic diction ("transience of human endeavor," "conceptual repricing") during high-pressure beats. Consistent single-POV though filter verbs ("Kael's eyes gleamed," "thoughts turned") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV consistent but voice drowns in lyrical clichés ("kaleidoscope of colors," "traveled stillness"). Filter-verb saturation ("Emilia felt," "she felt") erodes immediacy; no perceptual signature—Emilia notices generic "sensitive artist" tropes, not character-particular details.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct taste-focused POV voice with lyrical rhythm, but diction drifts into abstraction ("profound connection") during climax. No stress-induced compression under celestial pressure—prose stays uniformly elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice drifts between poetic ("nectar dusk glow") and clinical ("conceptual repricing"). Toll keeper's observations lack perceptual signature—"eyes lit up" generic. Dialogue functions as exposition ("drone beehive failure") with minimal subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV consistency wavers during ritual ("Eli felt the atmosphere shift" vs. omniscient "air vibrated"), diluting focalization. Prose has rhythmic control ("last wisps of winter's chill dissipated") but overuses lyrical abstraction ("beauty of the present moment palpable"). Avoids dialogue pitfalls but "daydreaming" streetlights break psychic distance. Perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; descriptions read as generic poetic filter.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice shifts from lyrical ("coral swayed like ballerinas") to abstract summary ("nuanced narrative"). Telepathic communication lacks character-specific perception; parrotfish thoughts sound identical to statue's narration, flattening focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("air thickened with weight of endless steps") reflects obsessive POV, but high-pressure beats devolve into template cadence: 8 consecutive "I [verb]" openings during dice contemplation dull immediacy. No dialogue present, so voice distinction bullets inapplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("saffron quiet," "kaleidoscope of faces") shines, but peak-beat interiority devolves into label-speak ("heart swelled with hope") without stress-induced syntactic compression. No head-hopping, but emotional calibration feels uniformly serene.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in decay/luminance focus. Voice modulates effectively under pressure but "photographically cursed" phrasing breaks POV lexicon. No head-hopping; consistent first-person intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature (cloud patterns as "hidden harmony") with rhythmic control matching music's complexity. Final paragraph's repetitive "The [noun]..." structure prevents 9.0 despite strong voice modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-focused noticing ("shell-scarred landmark"), with rhythmic compression during crack scene. Consistent third-person intimacy; "sunwashed dread" recurrence deepens texture without scaffold. No POV drift despite high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("trained to see beyond veil of time") with rhythmic control, but late shift to passive voice ("the truth began to emerge") dulls pressure in critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct poetic voice marred by register drift: "interlaced absence" sounds academic mid-task. Tics like "hushed blaze" recur without stress modulation, flattening peak-beat texture.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent introspective voice but filter-verb stacks ("Elara felt...") dull immediacy; perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias. No dialogue, yet internal rhythm lacks pressure-modulated cadence during deciphering climax.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("silken threads," "lunar light") modulates with emotion. Overwriting risks: "ephemeral whispers of subconscious" generic. No POV leaks, but stress compression weak—"tormented soul" tells where embodiment needed. Rhythmic control strong in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV slips into explanatory narration ("Dr. Patel had been analyzing ripple effects") breaking Amira’s trauma-filtered perception. "Intangibly tangible" jargon violates her plausible lexicon under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV voice has lyrical consistency but over-relies on stock phrases ("velvet expanse," "diamonds scattered"). Perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Lena notices beauty generically, not as a drone pilot.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal fingers" driftwood) with rhythmic control; purposeful compression ("sieved hush" definition) taught early and paid in carvings; zero head-hopping despite reflective depth.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "weathered stones/wind-scoured crenellations" but "furrowed hush" is jarring register drift. Voice modulates well until climax where interiority flattens into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "merrily melancholic" observations ("candle flame in the wind," "golden glow over water") modulates with emotional shifts. Rhythmic control mirrors paddling cadence, with no head-hopping in this single-POV piece.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Perceptual signature strong in bioluminescent details ("water’s glow seemed to be pulsing"), but register drift into therapy-speak ("jaded wonder," "humanity she had lost") undermines voice. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "began to sense") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical voice maintains consistent perceptual signature (scent/touch focus) with rhythmic control; stress moments lack syntactic compression that would heighten ritual pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("choking beauty," ink-stained fingers) sustains voice, but reflection-led mode risks over-30% BRR without sufficient micro-choices altering present options mid-memory.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears" as sensory anchor) modulates under pressure. Consistent lyric compression taught early pays off in closure, though "ghostly resolve" repetition risks template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent lyrical voice with character-particular noticing (e.g., "treasures for meager collection"), but filter-verbs dilute immediacy: "felt," "knew," "understand" recur 8x. Register drifts into abstraction ("texture of transformation") during peak moments. Perceptual signature lacks specificity—no philanthropist-tailored observations of the beach.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwritten cadence ("the sentinel...") and filter verbs ("knew," "realized") dull immediacy; all characters share identical elevated diction. Register drift into revolutionary jargon breaks POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct lyrical voice with rhythmic control ("borrowed dawn tone," "rhythmic pulse"), but repetitive "the herder" openings dull immediacy. Perceptual bias is consistent (focusing on patterns), yet internal thought lacks stress-distortion during high-pressure rock placement.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice dazzles with lyrical precision ("chorus of the damned," "storm-kissed wonder") and consistent perceptual bias. But register drift undermines POV—poet uses academic phrasing like "rarefy the air" mid-hurricane. Micro-tics ("she felt") accumulate but serve reflective tone without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture, but "diplomatically fierce" and "dignified chaos" become repetitive thematic tics; under duel stress, Aurélien's internal monologue remains unnaturally polished, lacking syntactic compression or degraded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("moon cleared the skyline, casting silver glow") and rhythmic control in opening, but stress flattens voice: rebuilding uses generic terms like "excitement and trepidation." No dialogue present, so those criteria exempt.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("compasses like fireflies," "music swirled like tide") shines, but filter-verb stacks ("gaze drifted," "realized she was being drawn") accumulate near climax. Voice modulates well with emotional intensity despite minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable but voice lacks character-specific texture; "empirically whimsical" and "luminous doubt" are abstract labels, not perceptual signatures. Prose modulates little under pressure—sentence rhythms stay uniformly lyrical during urgency, with no syntactic compression reflecting Aria's stress.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV slippage in "Kaito's story became part of the islet's history" breaks focalization. "Slow-spoken" trait isn't reflected in syntax, though rhythmic prose suits emotional texture.
