  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.6)

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction, reading as literary template prose. Filter-heavy constructions like "He realized" and "He felt" distance us from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—Mara's POV could belong to any thoughtful observer. Prose defaults to elevated literary register ("gentle hush," "cautious exuberance surge") without character-specific perception. No dialogue appears to test voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Mira's "culture shock absorber" role—she sees "patterns in the swirling festivals" others miss.

The perceptual signature of noticing hidden patterns and dual meanings stays consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.9)

    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated, mystical diction appropriate to the setting ("waning amber," "dust-laden archives"). However, the prose tends toward overwrought lyricism that obscures rather than clarifies action—"a bridge between the earthly and the unseen" remains abstract. The POV stays stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the astronomical focus.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains mystical register consistently with phrases like "vaulted heart" and "shifting grace," though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory. Mara's whispered dialogue carries appropriate subtext. The prose rhythm doesn't modulate enough with emotional intensity, maintaining steady ethereal tone even during transformation moments.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyrical register with controlled rhythm in phrases like "glass-mountain tone of silence" and "luminous thread slipping through fog like a comet."

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate diction for a fantasy-tinged setting, though lacks distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue between Lira and Mira feels functional but carries minimal subtext—Mira asks convenient questions that prompt exposition. The prose tends toward elevated register ("vaulted grove," "deciduous vows") without sufficient grounding in character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice maintains a dreamlike, philosophical register appropriate to the concept, with controlled diction like "luminous grove" and "brightened disquiet." However, the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature—the curator observes but doesn't filter through specific biases or expertise. Abstract phrases like "simply complicated" and "nonlinear inheritance" repeat without variation, creating a somewhat generic literary-fantastic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture—the prose could belong to any competent fantasy narrator rather than carrying Selene's specific perceptual signature. The arcane linguist's expertise shows in actions but doesn't sufficiently color the narrative diction or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "memories alter like watercolor bleeding on old parchment." Perceptual signature shows in how the discoverer experiences the world through story-terms ("each bubble a syllable"). Minor register elevation in places like "blissfully aberrant" but maintains coherence through mythic-poetic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent scholarly-mystical register appropriate to Mara's archivist perspective. Strong moments like "each step echoing the steady tick that marked the passage of seconds no one else could hear" show controlled voice, though some passages drift toward overwrought ("the cool breath of absence").

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains consistency with elevated, atmospheric prose fitting the mystical setting. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature - the mapkeeper notices everything with similar reverence. Phrases like "living auroras" and "bloom of hush" create texture but occasionally drift toward purple prose without advancing pressure or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "the wind's memory" and "star paths," though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("retrocognitively blessed"). The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the custodian notices everything with equal poetic weight rather than selective, character-specific attention.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "summer-quill archivist" and "deepening hush." No dialogue appears, avoiding potential voice issues. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("clouds peeled back, revealing a sky of bruised violet") without clear POV grounding, and perceptual signature remains generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled diction ("velvet blank," "ambient awareness") though occasionally drifts toward purple prose. No dialogue appears to evaluate. The POV remains stable in third-person limited, but the perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—the designer's professional eye doesn't meaningfully filter what's noticed versus ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent mystical tone but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - the chronicler's voice could belong to any contemplative observer. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The narrative distance remains safely removed without modulation under pressure since no real pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm: "his breath echoing off stone like a trapped sigh." POV remains stable in third-limited. However, register occasionally elevates beyond Lio's plausible lexicon ("xenial trellis," "intangibly tangible"), and some constructions feel writerly rather than emerging from character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm that mirrors the gondola's movement ("glided forward, its hull humming"). Perceptual signature focuses on sound/silence with selective attention. Some repetitive phrasing ("vaulting hush" appears 4 times) serves the accumulative mode though risks becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled imagery ("fermented jasmine and silicon"), though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Mina as lore keeper. Several instances of telling undercut immediacy ("She felt the weight of histories tug at her sleeves" rather than showing that weight through action or choice).

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "ashen charcoal sanctuary" and "tender shadow keeper," creating atmospheric texture. However, the elevated register occasionally strains credibility ("conduits, thin threads of memory") and lacks the perceptual signature of a distinct character—the narration reads as literary description rather than filtered consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "shadowseam wonder" and "violet curtain," creating distinct texture. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("virtuously mischievous," "tangible covenant") that strains against the survivor-narrator's established lexicon, particularly in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("In the first yawn of evening"). The prose maintains consistent psychic distance and POV stability. However, some passages drift toward purple prose ("vibrations dancing like ribbons of light") and the narrative occasionally tells what could be shown ("He realized that the vibrations were weaving a map").

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lyric voice maintains consistent mystical register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in passages like "every step stretched the night like a canvas awaiting a painter's breath." Some moments drift into elevated abstraction ("factually mystical," "shivering bliss") that strain against grounding, and filter constructions occasionally distance us from immediate sensation, but overall texture supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistent melancholic tone with controlled diction ("choreography," "unfurling") though syntax becomes monotonous with repeated participial phrases. POV remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Amelia notices everything with equal poeticism. Filter-heavy construction ("She felt," "She imagined," "She realized") dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though it tends toward elevated abstraction ("silver veil," "auric lagoon," "phantom fireflies") that occasionally obscures concrete action. Voice remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Mara notices everything with equal poetic intensity. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled mystical diction, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("filament of color stretched taut over the silence").

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic-lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("The hush where past meets prophecy"). However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Lira versus any mystical protagonist. The prose sometimes drifts into elevated diction ("luminous script across the ground") that, while atmospheric, doesn't feel rooted in Lira's particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric texture with controlled rhythm: "The tunnels beneath the city hummed with damp air." Perceptual signature shows in how Mara notices mechanical details and temporal paradoxes. Some register elevation occurs ("uncertainly certain pull," "serendipitous clue") but serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through the alchemist's technical focus on measurements, temperatures, and metallurgical states. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to intense focus during the repair to reflective conclusion. Some elevated diction ("factually mystical," "redemption of both the coin's broken story") occasionally strains against the otherwise grounded voice.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "translucent sighs" and "sunrise glass," creating a distinct texture appropriate to the spectral subject. POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual signature filtering the supernatural through concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression, though abstract diction ("proprioceptively enhanced," "lattice of bruised memories") occasionally obscures rather than illuminates. No dialogue appears, and the perceptual signature, while trauma-informed, lacks the specific selectivity that would distinguish Lira's unique way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.6)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "between-worlds translator" and "anchors of intuition," creating a dreamlike register appropriate to the concept. However, some passages drift into purple prose ("stars in a quiet sky") and the POV occasionally explains rather than embodies ("I realize that my translation has become that beacon").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some distinctive touches ("rain-slick night," "bruised clouds"). However, register drift into overly literary phrasing ("weightless burden," "tremulous glow") clashes with Mara's technical profession, and syntactic patterns become repetitive in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices everything with equal poetic elevation. Prose rhythm doesn't modulate with pressure; the rupture sequence maintains the same register as quieter moments. No dialogue limits character voice distinction. Some phrases feel committee-written: "negotiating reality itself."

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.3)
    The elevated register maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Lira could be any revolutionary on any baroque asteroid. POV modesty fails when the narrator asserts what "visitors from neighboring worlds" experience without showing their actual arrival or departure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register with controlled diction ("tinkersong wonder," "covenant of rust"). Some passages drift into elevated abstraction that doesn't fully match a repairman's perspective, and the narrative stance occasionally explains rather than embodies ("for he knew the chamber's fate was in the balance").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lexicon ("petrichor," "psychometry," "resonant hush") and rhythmic variation matching emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks distinct character voice—Mira's interiority reads as writerly meditation rather than character-specific perception. Heavy reliance on abstract constructions ("timewoven alliances echo," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") creates distance. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception filtered through an artist's sensibility ("bruised sky," "umbral tenderness"). Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("phosphorescent rhythm that matched her heartbeat"), but the texture generally supports the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "memory into flame" and "echoing cathedrals." POV remains stable with Mara throughout. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("retrocognitively trapped," "temporal snare") in ways that feel more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "bruised sky" and "skeleton of boarded windows," though it tends toward purple prose ("fragile glass of remembered desire"). The POV remains stable but distant, observing rather than experiencing. Perceptual signature lacks specificity—any contemplative character could narrate this.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct—Harel notices through linguistic and archival frames. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice stays coherent even under the prophecy's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signature ("frozen cathedral," "vortex inheritance," "furiously tranquil"). Some elevated diction ("cathedral," "covenant") fits the mythic register. Minor weakness in repetitive structures ("Mira felt," "She lifted," "She recalled," "She lowered") that could vary more, though the accumulative mode partially justifies the parallel construction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to the protagonist's role, with selective perception focused on weather phenomena and mechanical details. The prose modulates effectively between technical description ("temperature, humidity, and the subtle shift in wind pressure") and lyrical moments ("sang a soft lullaby"). No dialogue appears, which is acceptable; the internal focalization remains stable throughout with appropriate POV modesty about others' experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("swept stardust from the void with reverence") and effective POV modesty. The perceptual signature—sensing stellar heartbeats, feeling cosmic rhythms—stays character-specific. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "fertile ground" and "universal silence" that edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("Here the cracked hives clung to withered melons"). The POV remains stable in limited third person with appropriate narrative distance. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels performative rather than organic ("mute eloquence," "tranquily perceptive"), and the lack of dialogue removes a potential dimension of voice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "era-shifting chronicle" creating a distinct temporal texture. The prose modulates effectively, shifting from discovery ("Mara brushed away centuries of dust") to revelation ("the valley below seemed to inhale the future"). However, some phrases edge toward purple prose ("constellations made of silver sand"), and the POV occasionally slips into omniscient territory when describing villagers' collective experience.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though it tends toward elevated diction ("burnished hush," "tapestry of woven dawns") that occasionally obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical-botanical register with phrases like "bruised amber" and "conductive tendons," though it occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("silent testament to interspecies dialogue"). The narrator's perceptual signature focuses on botanical and geological details fitting Mara's role. Some passages feel overwritten ("the quiet language of trees and stones alike"), but the voice coheres around careful observation and technical precision with the copper-wrapping methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled diction ("luminous skeptic," "bronze quiet resonance"), though it occasionally drifts into abstraction. No dialogue appears, avoiding that potential weakness, but the perceptual signature could be more distinctly Arin's rather than omniscient literary voice, particularly in passages about scholars observing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.6)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the coachman notices what any observer might see. Repetitive phrasing ("narrow vastness" appears four times) and template constructions ("He whispered," "He scattered," "He watched") flatten rhythm without pattern-teaching that would justify the repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency through dog-specific perception ("ears pruning the hush") and post-apocalyptic register. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("mute testimony," "palpable closeness") that slightly exceeds Rook's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.3)
    The lyric voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm, particularly in phrases like "minutes stretched like taffy." However, some constructions feel overwrought ("blessed pariah stepped onto the time dilation observation deck") and the perceptual signature lacks distinctive character-specific bias beyond poetic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct voice with controlled diction: "icebound spire rose like a glittering monolith, its frozen teeth clawing the heavens." POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the gallery setting, with selective perception focused on architectural and light details. The prose rhythm modulates effectively during pattern-walking sequences. However, some phrases drift toward purple prose ("vaulted whispering gallery, where light fell in thin ribbons"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinctive voice weaves mythic register ("mercury-glass seer," "labyrinthine bookstore") with sensory precision ("pine resin and old ink"). Perceptual signature shows in how Lira experiences through vibration and reflection rather than direct sight. Rhythm modulates effectively from flowing description to shorter pulses during discovery ("She pressed the feather deeper"), though occasional drift into elevated abstraction ("maps of feeling, each curve a compass") slightly weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density. However, the voice lacks distinct personality beyond its elevated diction, and passages like "fierce repose, a paradox of calm rage" feel more like authored description than genuine character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "wounded beast" and "forged hush," though register occasionally elevates beyond Mara's POV ("cognitive smoothness," "resonant peace"). The narrative stance remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond artistic observation.

    Distinctive voice merges alchemical/mechanical imagery ("clock-gear heart," "gears-and-cogs whirring") with lyrical meditation.

The prose rhythm effectively modulates between longer philosophical passages and shorter urgent moments ("She lifted the charm, aligning its loop").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    The painter's voice maintains consistency with artistic perception filtering the world ("mixing oil with memory," "brushstrokes of a tempest"). The lyrical register suits the nostalgic tone, though phrases like "temporary eternity settle in my chest" occasionally drift toward abstraction. The controlled use of past tense and the painter's selective attention to color and light create a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.4)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency but suffers from overwriting ("screaming tenderness," "cobalt lighthouse"). Abstract philosophical language ("vibrations of intent," "purified intent") doesn't match a lighthouse keeper's likely lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "cracked hush" and "skeletal ribs," creating distinct texture. POV remains stable in third-person limited, tracking the navigator's perception of the censer foot's changes and the station's deterioration.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The first-person voice maintains consistency with methodical observation befitting a truffle forager, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured grace," "covenant of empathy") that strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance, though Marlowe's perceptual signature lacks distinction beyond poetic observation. Phrases like "softly persistent rhythm" and repeated "softly persistent" create intentional pattern but risk becoming mechanical rather than voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("blooming cavern opened its hidden throat to moonlight") and consistent POV. The prose modulates appropriately between contemplative and active moments, maintaining the map dealer's selective perception throughout without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, maintaining the fairy-tale register throughout. However, the prose relies on abstract elevated diction ("disenchanted," "ethereal," "crystalline") that creates distance rather than immediacy. The repetition of "shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" feels forced rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness, relying on elevated diction ("palette of resolve," "density of presence") that feels more conceptual than embodied. Repetitive phrasing appears throughout: "ember nexus at twilight" (4x), "returning differently" (4x), "pocket-sun alchemist" (5x) creates template cadence. No dialogue prevents character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains consistency with lyrical phrases like "feral echo of nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" that match the chronicler's perspective.

The voice coheres around tactile and water imagery but lacks rhythmic variation under supposed emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic-lyrical register but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("breath between storms" appears three times, "saturated hush" twice).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and metaphorical density ("gossip-column exorcist," "notebook clutched like a holy relic").

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains mystical register consistently with controlled rhythm in phrases like "resounding hush" and "wanderingly exact." However, diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("luminous glyphs," "cascade of stars") without earning the elevation through specific embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice maintains consistent register through technical-poetic fusion ("hydraulic clock shepherd," "razor edges of steel"), with controlled psychic distance and purposeful compression. The perceptual signature of someone attuned to mechanical rhythms and natural cycles holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with some distinctive phrasing ("quiet wildfire calm," "spatially gifted"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstract meditation that doesn't match the technical specialist POV. No dialogue appears despite multiple workers present, missing opportunities for subtext and character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent literary register but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices like a narrator, not a gambler's daughter. Phrases like "veins of possibility" and "clover melancholy" feel imposed rather than emerging from her specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm ("narrow subway utility tunnel stretched like a forgotten vein") and selective perception focused on sound and resonance. Brief dialogue with Lena carries subtext effectively, though some abstract constructions ("cultivated estrangement," "teaching endings how to begin") occasionally drift from embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic poeticism. Repetitive constructions ("haunted euphoria" appears four times) and template phrases ("gently thorough" used mechanically) flatten the voice. The elevated diction often drifts into purple prose without serving character or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice lacks distinct perceptual signature - Lira's logistician expertise doesn't sufficiently color her observations. Phrases like "whispered across continents like a secret handshake" show moments of texture, but overall diction feels literary-generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm in phrases like "traced the contours of memory with her fingertips." The perceptual signature of synesthetic experience (absorbing language through skin, dowsing magnetic whispers) creates distinct texture, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("nexus where all absorbed languages converged") that strains against intimate moments.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistent register with some distinctive touches like "confidently uncertain" and astronomical metaphors, but relies heavily on abstract philosophical musing. No dialogue to evaluate, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament to the willingness") that doesn't match the intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "mute grammar" and "living stave," but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—both Arlen and Lira perceive the world through identical poetic filters. The elevated diction ("luminous," "tableau," "choreography") creates distance rather than immediacy, and the voice convergence between characters suggests a single authorial presence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the protagonist's "analytically intuitive" nature rarely manifests in specific observational patterns. Prose tends toward elevated register ("volcanic tenderness rise within him") that doesn't align with an arsonist's likely lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical premise, but lacks distinct perceptual signature for Lira as guinea pig protagonist. Several passages drift into omniscient commentary ("Thus the tale...became more than a story") that breaks POV consistency, and no dialogue appears to ground character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and atmospheric description that reflects Milo's maintenance worker perspective. However, the narrative voice lacks distinctive texture—phrases like "calculated spontaneity" and "steel corridors" could belong to any competent narrator. Milo's perceptual signature doesn't emerge strongly through selective attention or biased observation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.6)
    Consistent lyrical voice with controlled rhythm, though it tends toward purple prose ("spiralingly calm," "dental mirror held gently against the darkness"). The repetitive sentence structures ("The guardian..." "It...") create monotony rather than purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to Mara's character. Abstract phrases like "where past meets prophecy" and "humble rebellion" create a committee voice of elevated vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("seafoam clung to stone," "muscles sang of patience") that maintains consistency. POV remains stable with Mara throughout. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("crucible where one must detach") that doesn't fully align with a dock worker's lexicon, though the mythic tone partially justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. However, Mara's voice lacks distinctiveness—phrases like "morally ambiguous purpose" and "quiet transformation" read as authorial rather than character-filtered. The theatrical narration she performs is summarized rather than rendered in her actual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond poeticism. Phrases like "lantern-moth hush" and "cloud-shadow poet" prioritize atmosphere over character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled metaphorical density appropriate to an artist-protagonist ("courtyard glimmered with shards of sunrise," "canvases tucked under her arm like fragile promises").

Some elevated diction ("innocently cunning") occasionally strains but mostly serves the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("prism-song," "golden shadows"). However, diction occasionally elevates beyond plausibility ("synthetic pilgrimage across neural pathways") and dialogue consists of a single rhetorical question rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the narrator observes poetically but without character-specific bias. Phrases like "subdued ardor" and "genuinely artificial" create texture but feel imposed rather than emerging from a particular consciousness experiencing grief.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical-academic register with controlled rhythm, though it tends toward purple prose ("rain-kissed rooftops," "onyx-ink symbols forming a lattice").

    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to the historian character. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the historian notices everything with equal poetic weight rather than filtering through his specific expertise or emotional state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" and "softly deliberate," but this elevated diction creates distance rather than intimacy.

No dialogue appears to provide contrast or naturalistic grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent mystical-naturalist register appropriate to Mara's perspective, with controlled use of color and texture imagery. However, the narrative voice tends toward elevated abstraction ("quietly vivid tapestry," "shimmering stillness") that distances rather than immerses, lacking the distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and consistent POV. The telepathic plant communication is handled deftly through images and whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signature ("dust of forgotten reels swirled like slow snow").

    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled diction ("moonstruck," "aurora-lit," "shadowed rapture"). POV remains stable in close third. However, the voice relies heavily on abstract poeticisms that distance rather than embody: "verses that never reached sunrise," "chamber of imagination sealed by doubt." The perceptual signature lacks specificity beyond romantic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("metronome of sighs," "stitching destiny") and mythic register appropriate to the fable-like narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm ("humming a shoreline lullaby," "silver eyes reflecting the sea's sighs"). Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("a bright star now etched upon her soul") but the maritime lexicon and mythic register mostly cohere. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent atmosphere through phrases like "seraphically mundane" and "frostbitten hope," creating a distinctive melancholic register. However, the voice relies heavily on abstract declarations and elevated diction ("unpardonable silence," "bastion of seraphically mundane guardianship") that obscures rather than clarifies. No dialogue tests naturalism, and the POV remains distant from any specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "diminutive titan" and "regally unpretentious" establishing a mythic register. The perceptual signature shows in selective details like "faded glyphs that whispered" and "starlight" emergence. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("planetary presence," "inevitable collapse") that occasionally obscures the POV's grounding, and syntactic variety could better modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with some distinctive phrasing ("drifting moored," "periodically eternal"), but lacks strong perceptual signature—Mara and Eli could swap observations without loss. Prose becomes abstract during key moments ("the ocean itself was holding its breath") rather than maintaining embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks distinct personality beyond poetic abstraction. Perceptual signature privileges cosmic metaphor ("bruised sky," "galaxies") over grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent melancholic register with controlled metaphorical density ("sea-salt breath," "fractured ribs," "threads of narrative").

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV but suffers from elevated register drift ("ephemeral patterns," "conduit," "tapestry of existence") that reads as writerly rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains lyric consistency but suffers from register elevation that exceeds plausibility ("transliterates emotions into currents," "somnolent drift").

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice shows distinct texture through phrases like "ink once fell like rain on dead stories" though occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lattice of possibilities").

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "meteor hush tone" and "constellation tattooist," creating a dreamlike register. However, the prose becomes overwrought with abstractions: "the universe itself had taken a breath" and "stardust upon every trembling heart."

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.9)

Repetitive phrasing undermines voice ("quivering hush" appears 5 times, "wistfully pragmatic" twice). No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative voice reads more like elevated description than character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception (Mara notices coded stanzas, feels syllables against spine) and some effective rhythm modulation during stress. However, register drift appears in abstract phrases like "reversible exile of her forebear's spirit" and "moral compass" that exceed Mara's established lexicon, and the prose occasionally slips into explanatory mode rather than maintaining embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    The elevated fantasy register maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the visionary notices everything with equal mystical weight. Phrases like "anxious elation" and "root-bound visionary" feel more like labels than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate lexicon for an ex-roadie turned appraiser, though diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("wrested from its rust a story of lost direction"). The "confidently uncertain" paradox is stated but not embodied through syntax or rhythm shifts that would make the tension palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the fantastical premise. Strong moments like "coaxing stories from stone" and "ladder transformed into a spiral of magnetic vines." Some filter-heavy passages ("Lira felt," "She remembered") reduce immediacy during key transformative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent omniscient voice with controlled mythic register appropriate to the fable-like tone. Some elevated diction ("wintersun serenity," "tidal atrium") fits the fantastical setting though occasionally drifts toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Mara as bunker inspector. Abstract constructions ("resonant hush wrapped the world") dominate over concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "ache of a body just after stopping the medication" and "truth-seeking river chronicler," though some passages drift toward elevated register ("cartography of the soul").

    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm—"slow, trembling aurora" and "radiant hush" establish texture immediately. Perceptual signature shows in how she experiences static as physical pulse and reads light patterns others dismiss. Some elevated diction ("covenant with the universe") occasionally drifts from the intimate register but serves the mythic scope.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent distance with selective perception ("scalloping rhythm," vine focus). Voice shows control in phrases like "umbral grotto" and "scallop upon stone" but occasionally drifts into elevated register disconnected from Mara's caretaker perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("its claws brushing spines of ancient, frost-bitten volumes"), though some constructions feel overwrought ("dimensionally homesick, longing for the echo of a home"). The perceptual signature works - everything filtered through a beast-becoming-curator consciousness.

    The prose maintains consistent POV and atmospheric texture ("crashing hush," "jellyfish bellies lit from within"). However, register drift into technical jargon ("phase transition arrays") clashes with the lyrical voice, and key information is withheld without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong perceptual signature with scientific precision meeting poetic observation ("frozen lantern," "cascade of code"). The voice maintains consistency through technical and lyrical registers. Minor issues with occasional overwriting ("indifferent sky," "crystalline whispers") that push toward purple prose without fully committing to a heightened register.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would make the violinist's consciousness memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical compression ("cobalt arcade at twilight hummed") and Milo's perception filters details appropriately. Some register elevation doesn't quite match a mailman's likely lexicon ("respectfully rebellious gait," "fragile bridge").

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with purposeful repetition of key phrases creating incantatory rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the underwater setting. Perceptual signature shows in how Mort notices "threads of filament" and "coil of tangled copper." However, some passages drift into elevated register ("luminous path of release," "sophisticated melancholy") that feels imposed rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "driftingly alert" and "binary sighs" that match the ethereal tone. The ghost's single line of dialogue carries authentic yearning in its metaphoric request. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("articulate unspoken needs that no mortal tongue could carry") that feels more authorial than character-driven, and some constructions read as artificially poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The elevated register maintains consistency with phrases like "frozen lighthouse" and "helix," creating a fable-like distance appropriate to the fantastical setting. Voice modulates from descriptive opening to warmer closing promise. However, the prose lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond general lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on sky phenomena. The perceptual signature—seeing "heartbeats of pilots long gone" through telescope lenses—is distinctive. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("moth's wing against the dust-filled night") without earning the elevation through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"fractally precise," "heightened stillness," "soft echo." Lira's perceptual signature as a face-blind artist shapes what she notices. However, some phrases feel overwrought ("the world sounded like a held breath"), and the narrative distance remains uniformly elevated without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and employs purposeful repetition ("stranded luminance," "sociable isolation") that creates texture, though some phrases feel overwrought ("amber breath," "silver threads that wrapped around the copper like vines"). No dialogue appears, and the POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("coat frayed like old driftwood," "ink trembling like sea-foam"). Some figurative density borders on overwriting ("filament of light that curled like a whisper") but serves the accumulative mode. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The omniscient voice maintains consistent distance with lyrical descriptions like "brambled hope that twined through their hearts." POV remains stable without head-hopping. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature and occasionally drifts into abstraction ("tangled optimism that grew stronger").

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm - "nested patterns of wind and echo," "quiet river of silver light." The perceptual signature is distinct in how Elara notices textures and patterns rather than concrete details. Some repetition of "bruised awe" and "nested patterns" serves the accumulative design, though the third use of "bruised awe" feels mechanical rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent POV with distinctive voice through unusual constructions ("perched on the cliffside labyrinth," "impressions without touching"). Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to mechanical birds and frost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision balanced against lyrical observation ("stone walls twisting like intertwined strands of DNA"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("symphonically minded," "organic chaos") slightly strains the POV's established lexicon. The perceptual signature of seeing patterns everywhere is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting. POV remains stable with the vendor. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fragmentary tone that stitched the library together in integrated fragmentation") and the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would distinguish this narrator from generic literary fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical premise, with Chef Lir's perceptual signature filtering everything through taste and culinary metaphor.

Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("subsume," "conduit") that slightly exceeds the established voice register.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and biblical cadence ("her voice already humming a litany").

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the concept, with phrases like "quaking reverie" and "helix-minded" creating texture. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature - Aria's engineering background doesn't sufficiently color her observations. Abstract constructions like "chaotically precise" and "entangled memories" feel more like concept labels than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic-scholarly register with controlled vocabulary like "clandestinely luminous" and "serpentine grotto." The voice effectively modulates between precise cataloguing language and more fluid perception during the gravity inversion, though some phrases like "latent blaze" become repetitive tics.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with musical metaphors and sensory focus appropriate to a sound artist. However, repetitive constructions appear ("He believed," "He kept strumming," "He had set out") creating template cadence. The phrase "empathy in motion" recurs mechanically. Perceptual signature exists but could be more distinctive—any artist might notice these details.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice maintains elevated, philosophical register throughout ("hopeful melancholy humming in his veins"), but lacks the perceptual signature and rhythmic variation that would distinguish this specific tutor.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains consistent theatrical elevation with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on resonance and frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice emerges through the fusion of technical printing terminology with mystical elements ("cryptic letterpress operator," "halo fragment").

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "jittery" matching the courier's nervous energy, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("natural cathedral," "mythic wonder"). Perceptual signature shows in how the courier reads the pendant's vibrations and maps "unseen currents." Some repetitive phrasing ("germinate" appears 6 times) creates template cadence that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    The mystical register creates atmosphere but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Liora could be any mystic rather than this particular one. Phrases like "truthful lie that bent the very air" and "shifted hush" repeat without variation. The prose maintains competent consistency but doesn't modulate with emotional intensity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with lyrical compression: "the air clung to a hush that felt like the breath of an ancient loom." The perceptual signature maintains consistency through weaving-inflected observations.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Marek's contemplative nature. POV remains stable in third-limited. However, the narrative voice drifts into overwrought territory ("luminescent ache," "quiet sentinel") without earning this elevation through dramatized emotion. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    The lyric voice creates atmosphere through phrases like "sea sighed beneath" and "thunder and mirth," but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mira's centuries of experience don't alter her diction or observation patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Lira observes beautifully but generically, without character-specific bias or selection. Phrases like "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" repeat mechanically rather than evolving with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the story's meditative tone, with phrases like "wisps of smoke" and "half-remembered songs." However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature - Eli could be any maintenance worker rather than this specific individual. Some phrasing tends toward the generic literary ("modest glow against the rattling wind") rather than character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantasy setting, with controlled mythic diction ("epochs," "woven dawns"). However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—descriptions remain externally focused without filtering through Lira's specific consciousness. Extended metaphorical passages ("cathedral of glass and vines," "loom of woven dawns") create distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical tone with phrases like "rain-kissed" and "nested paradoxes," but relies heavily on abstract telling ("enlarged tranquility settled like fog") over concrete perception. No dialogue appears despite two characters meeting, missing opportunities for subtext, and the POV filters everything through the same elevated register without modulation under supposed emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("creeping normality noticer slipped through"). However, abstract register ("tenuous absolution," "heuristically gentle") clashes with the embodied scene work, creating distance. The POV filters setting effectively but relies on elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature filters the world through archival precision—the chief notes frequencies, measures silence, catalogues echoes. Prose rhythm modulates with scene needs, accelerating during the slide's awakening. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("bruised violet," "syllables of childhood") that strain against the established meticulous voice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception like "iron-tasting rumors" and the maritime lexicon. However, some phrases feel overwrought: "a brittle note that once echoed in her father's lullabies" strains credibility. The prose modulates appropriately during action sequences, tightening syntax when Lila lunges and darts, though occasional purple patches ("choreographed through countless false starts") interrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric-speculative register with controlled diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "emergent compass"). However, several instances of conceptual redundancy ("forgotten futures"/"future remembered," multiple explanations of the compass) and abstract philosophizing dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphoric density ("walls glittered like frozen starlight," "auroral sorrow"). Some moments drift toward purple prose ("Light braided with sorrow"), but the perceptual signature remains distinct through Lena's artistic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction fits the elevated register of a calligrapher ("gilded-leaf," "vaulted hall," "resonant"). The prose modulates effectively with scene pressure, though some passages lean toward writerly construction over natural speech rhythms ("The words were clear, each syllable a bright thread").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and appropriate diction for the contemplative tone. However, the prose tends toward purple abstraction ("symphonies of truth," "muted vigor") without grounding in the character's specific perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits voice distinction possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains consistent omniscient distance with lyrical texture ("throbbed with heat," "whispered ancient code"), though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature for Vira specifically.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical tone but lacks a distinct perceptual signature for Mara. Repetitive phrases like "sandstorm calm" (6 instances), "aged locket" (4), "locked mailbox mystery" (3), and "led through following" create mechanical echoes rather than purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in passages like "each pirouette encrypted a fragment of vulnerability," though this elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied action into abstract declaration. No dialogue appears, appropriately for the single-character scenario. The POV remains stable in close third, but the perceptual signature lacks the selective bias that would make Selene's way of noticing distinctly hers versus any dancer-coder.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.3)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and patterned imagery (lanterns, wildflowers, gravity). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gleaming silence," "luminous grotto") that feels decorative rather than character-driven, and Mara's perceptual signature lacks distinctive bias beyond poetic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature throughout—"falling fire," "ghosts of stone," "cosmic display"—with consistent mystical-scholarly register. The narrator's selective attention to architectural animacy ("fingertips brushing the rusted iron rail as though testing each vibration") reflects unique consciousness. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains POV credibility ("mysterious familiarity," "conspiratorial") and dialogue absence that prevents full voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.6)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond poetic abstraction. No dialogue appears, which is acceptable, but the narrative voice doesn't modulate with emotional intensity, remaining at the same elevated register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm ("traced inked spirals on cold stone").

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("serpentine nexus under starlight"). Perceptual signature clear in how the singer processes sound and vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity"). However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("luminous tapestry," "scaffolding of existence") without sufficient grounding in the philosopher's specific perspective. The perceptual signature remains generic—any contemplative character might notice these same details.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Mira, with some effective perceptual details like "each fragment shouting a hidden clue." However, the narrative voice lacks distinctiveness and occasionally slips into exposition ("Mira understood that the cursed legend was a smokescreen") rather than dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains an elevated, prophetic register appropriate to the visionary concept but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond atmospheric description. POV control is stable but the narrative voice reads more like omniscient proclamation than intimate focalization. The repetitive "variant allegiance" and "ancient shadows" phrases create a drumbeat effect that flattens voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent lyrical voice with controlled rhythm ("ragged coat billowing like a sigh") and apt metaphorical language that serves the accumulative mode. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to sound and texture over visual detail.

POV remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature. The prose reads as literary exercise rather than embodied perspective, with abstract observations replacing concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent close third-person POV with Mara's investigative perspective coloring observations ("uncanny glow," "memories entangled").

The narrative voice lacks distinct personality beyond professional competence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness, reading more like competent literary fiction template than a unique perspective.

The shopkeeper's minimal dialogue reveals little character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent whimsy through phrases like "rebellious kite" and "sarcastic philosophers debating," with controlled rhythm that matches the floating, mechanical world. POV remains stable in close third, though Mara's interiority is thin—we get her actions and single joke but little perceptual signature. The anthropomorphized workshop elements (gears groaning in amusement) work within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Lia's role, with controlled shifts during discovery moments. Some filter-heavy passages ("She realized," "She felt") dull immediacy in middle beats. The prose rhythm accelerates appropriately during the server farm discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm ("each broken hull, each splintered mast, sang a low dirge"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("susurrus," "windborne solace") fits the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency but suffers from elevated register drift ("intersubjective understanding," "terroir") that reads more like literary essay than embodied perspective.

The sentinel's perceptual signature lacks specificity beyond generic poetic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to its parable-like nature, with controlled repetition ("echo of wisdom," "peripheral awareness," "consecrate") that builds textural density.

    The voice maintains a lyrical, meditative register appropriate to the ritual nature of the scene, with controlled rhythm that mirrors Mira's deliberate actions. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels detached from Mira's embodied experience ("the lagoon's surface mirrored a sky quilted with moving clouds"). The lack of dialogue is appropriate but limits opportunities for voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though it occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("sidereal patience," "kaleidoscopic prayers") that strains against Mara's skeptic characterization. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to light and luminescence throughout. Some filter constructions ("she sensed," "she crouched") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the otherworldly setting, with controlled rhythm in longer sentences that mirror the garden's "breathing." However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("generational tapestry," "harmonic frequencies"). The perceptual signature stays focused on cosmic scale and mathematical patterns but lacks distinctive syntactic personality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the premise ("humid sigh," "thoughtful gravestone carver," "fiercely meditative river"). However, it lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Eliam notices things poetically but not in ways specific to a stone carver's trained eye. Some phrases feel overwrought ("thundering calm" appears three times) without earning their weight through precision.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the mystical tone, with some effective rhythmic passages ("each tick a breath shared between human hands and the ocean's pulse"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("searing reverie that burned within her resolve") and the POV tells us Mara's conclusions rather than showing her arrive at them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with distinctive phrases like "velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes," though occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("monolith that seemed to swallow the moonlight") that strains against the gardener's humble occupation. The perceptual signature is selective and atmospheric but lacks the granular specificity of lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    The omniscient voice maintains consistent distance and employs evocative diction ("ignorance cartographer," "lattice of arrows"), but lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to character. No dialogue to evaluate, and while the prose has texture, it doesn't modulate significantly with emotional intensity or pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasional phrases like "thistled calm demeanor" and "secretly luminous" feel artificially elevated. POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer. The perceptual signature of noticing light and sound patterns distinguishes the narrator's attention.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with phrases like "frozen breaths of lost time" but suffers from register drift into elevated diction ("somber marvel at her own resilience") that doesn't match the ritualistic POV. Perceptual signature exists but remains generic—any mystical practitioner could notice these details.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent philosophical register with controlled vocabulary ("rationally rebellious," "sedimentary layers") that fits the wannabe philosopher character. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to mechanical and geological details. Some register elevation ("complementary verses of the same epic") occasionally strains but mostly serves the character's self-conscious intellectualism.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited perspective but relies heavily on abstract, elevated diction ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") that distances rather than embodies experience. Voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—the narrator observes generically rather than through the teacher's specific musical expertise. Dialogue is absent, missing opportunity for character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Mara's contemplative perspective, with effective modulation during the alignment sequence. Some phrases like "informally wise" and "gentle rebellion" feel prompt-derived rather than organically voiced, and dialogue (whispers to plants) could carry more subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"the tower's purpose was to harvest the stray bolts that fell like rain on the dead streets below." POV remains stable with Mara's perception filtering all detail. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("nectar dusk of the tower's glow") beyond what her toll keeper role suggests, and some constructions feel writerly rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "streetlights daydream" and "hushed blaze," creating a contemplative register appropriate to the narrator's observational stance. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sanctify my own restless mind") that doesn't fully align with the more grounded sensory moments. The lack of dialogue means all characterization must come through narration, which sometimes tells rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.7)
    Lyric voice maintains consistency with elaborate metaphorical language suited to the underwater fantasy. However, repetitive phrasing ("cascading revelations" appears 4 times, "structural weakness" 3 times) creates template cadence. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature remains generic rather than distinctly characterized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent philosophical-poetic register appropriate to Aric's mathematician-poet nature, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "each step a silent promise of ascent and return." No dialogue appears, avoiding potential inconsistency. The perceptual signature shows through mathematical framings ("geometry of probability," "living algorithm"), though some passages drift toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyrical voice maintains consistent texture through selective perception ("waxing moon's glow," "silvered sap") and rhythm that supports the meditative tone. Some register elevation ("quiet conduit," "lexicon of remembrance") occasionally drifts from Mara's established perspective, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled imagery ("mist and wilted lilies," "brittle coins") but lacks distinct perceptual signature specific to Liora as museum guide. Prose rhythm supports accumulative buildup though some phrases feel overwrought ("ghost of memory in every artifact").

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice maintains consistent POV with some distinctive touches like "the ocean seemed to inhale and release its breath" and technical precision around the mechanical elements. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("bleak exhilaration that pulsed through his veins") and the prose lacks the rhythmic control that would heighten tension during the decoding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    Voice suffers from severe overwriting with mixed metaphors ("moon hung like a rotten lantern," "bleeding luminance") and register drift into purple prose that obscures rather than illuminates. The POV maintains consistency but drowns in ornamental language. Dialogue exists only as the advisor's hissing, which reads generically villainous.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent mythic-lyrical voice with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "Each beat was generated by fractal generating patterns." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sketched resonance," "restless euphony") that feels more authorial than character-sourced. Some syntactic patterns become repetitive, especially "He [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("spiral-shell cartographer whose maps spiraled outward"). The prose modulates effectively between description and discovery. However, diction occasionally drifts into unnecessarily ornate constructions ("gargantuan turtles that trudged eternally") and filter phrases appear without clear voice motivation ("Mira understood that").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains scholarly register appropriate to Arlen's historian persona, with controlled rhythm in descriptive passages. However, abstract philosophical language ("emotionally rational heart acknowledging that compassion could coexist with stark fact") creates distance rather than immediacy during the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices everything with equal poetic weight rather than selective, character-specific bias. Phrases like "interlaced absence" repeat mechanically without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited perspective with appropriate academic register for Mara's scholarly mindset. However, repetitive phrasing ("reclaimed stillness" appears 5 times, "dappled resolve" 3 times, "antique ink stamp" 8 times) creates mechanical echo rather than purposeful pattern, and filter-heavy constructions dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on light and transformation. However, the elevated register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("filaments as if coaxing fireflies into cages of crystal") that prioritizes beauty over clarity, and no dialogue tests naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the conceptual material, with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the energy surge. The perceptual signature ("intangibly tangible," synesthetic descriptions) is distinctive, though occasional register drift into technical abstraction ("perturbation theory") slightly disrupts the emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "brilliant dimness" creating atmospheric texture, but lacks distinct perceptual signature. The prose defaults to elevated register ("vaulted chamber," "dormant memory") without grounding in Lira's specific consciousness. Dialogue is minimal and purely functional, missing subtext or character-revealing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistent register with some atmospheric texture ("sieved hush," "tempered regret") but lacks distinct perceptual signature. The prose relies on abstract emotional labeling ("guilt-ridden," "restless ache") rather than filtering perception through the specific lens of someone who manufactures false histories. Overuse of filter constructions ("I realized," "seemed to") dulls immediacy without serving character-specific purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent melancholic register with some effective imagery ("silent metronome," "slipping into the mist like a forgotten promise"). However, repetitive phrasing ("furrowed hush" appears three times) and the complete absence of distinct dialogue voice for the opposing negotiator weakens the POV work.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with moments of lyrical elevation ("sunrise painted the sea with trembling gold"). However, register drift occurs in peak moments ("gravitate toward horizons that call for growth") where abstract philosophy replaces the navigator's concrete perception. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with effective water/light imagery ("cathedral of algae," "phosphor-scaled fish"), though diction occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophy ("labyrinth of choices," "tapestry of humanity"). The perceptual signature of reading coded messages in water and feeling objects' emotional weight is distinctive but sometimes tells rather than embodies states.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.3)
    The elevated, mythic voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Liora notices everything with equal poetic intensity ("silvered mist," "luminous grove," "violet glow") without selective attention that would reveal character. The prose rhythm remains uniformly lyrical without modulation for emotional peaks or pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyric voice maintains consistency with phrases like "onyx-ink cartomancer" and "choking beauty," creating distinct texture through compound imagery. However, the elevated register occasionally strains credibility ("the air thickening with a choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet"). No dialogue appears, and the perceptual signature remains generically mystical rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent ethereal register appropriate to the premise, with effective rhythmic control in passages like "From the widening fissure a pale wind breathed." However, the narrative voice lacks distinctive personality beyond its poetic mode, and some constructions feel overwrought ("ghost of forgotten propulsion").

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("The night settled over the black sand beach"), though it occasionally drifts into overwrought abstraction ("vibrant hush that sang of possibilities blooming in the shadows of ash"). Mara's perceptual signature focuses on luminosity and cosmic patterns, creating coherent if sometimes purple voice.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and some distinctive touches ("phosphorescent pulse," "bronze quill holder clinking softly"). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("cascade of invisible currents that fluttered through the fort's veins") without earning the elevation through pressure or character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic-poetic register appropriate to the eel herder's otherworldly perspective, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "each grain vibrating with the memory of a supernova." However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond elevated diction, and some constructions feel artificially literary ("borrowed dawn of peace").

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing that exceeds the poet-focalizer's immediate perception, particularly in the extended denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct texture, reading as elevated literary register without character-specific perception. "Dignified chaos" and "hidden overture" repeat as labels rather than embodied experience. The prose privileges abstract philosophizing over concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical texture but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Lira, now wearing the calm of a monk and the fire of a child"). Dialogue between Lira and Rook feels stilted and overtly thematic. The perceptual signature lacks specificity - descriptions could belong to any poetic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm ("fingers hovering above ivory keys," "silver rain"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("metronome for the unplayed," "tide-woven branches") that strains against the pianist character's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "empirically whimsical mind" and "bright hall of doubt" that reflect Mara's unique perspective. The perceptual signature shows in how she "catalogued dreams as if they were weather charts." Some register elevation occurs ("translucent realm," "ethereal with the empirical") that slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with measured, lyrical prose matching the "slow-spoken" tutor, but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond generic poetic observation. Heavy reliance on abstract constructions ("tides of remembrance," "rhythmically placid pulse") creates distance without character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, possessing a poetic yet analytical texture that reflects Mara's character. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on similar sentence structures in the labor chant, though this is largely voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, poetic voice that modulates effectively under pressure ("the library’s cracked dome let in constellations that seemed to chart a map of forgotten stories"). The prose is highly controlled, though a very slight convergence toward a more uniform lyrical register in the final paragraphs prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature defined by its lyrical, obsessively precise diction. The voice is consistently controlled, and purposeful compression (e.g., "summarizing silence") is taught early and pays off at closure.

    The prose possesses a distinct, controlled, and lyrical perceptual signature that perfectly reflects the robot's sentient yet analytical consciousness. POV is stable and apt, with diction and syntax that remain within its plausible lexicon even at peak intensity. The rhythmic control is exceptional, mirroring the low hum of the courtyard and the crystalline chord of the violin. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.

    The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled, rhythmic cadence that modulates beautifully with the story's quiet intensity. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perceptive, slightly poetic sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature that notices the garden in terms of promises and rhythms. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture, though some sentences are overly dense, bordering on preciousness ("a ritual of commemorating small victories elaborately").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice suited to an oracle. The prose is highly controlled, though a slight register drift occurs in phrases like "auroral sorrow," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's otherwise concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct and consistently maintained, with a percussive, sensory-rich rhythm that perfectly mirrors the protagonist's "drowsy alertness." The dense, figurative language is largely voice-motivated and pattern-taught, though it occasionally borders on overwriting in its density ("its beads glimmered like frozen syllables"), preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("feeling the weight of each stone as if it murmurs a tale"). The lyrical, compressed prose is voice-motivated and pattern-taught.

Distance control is steady and free of head‑hopping, and the brief sailor shard is cleanly separated. A few repeated formulations and elevated abstractions flatten modulation at peak beats. Still, rhythm and image management generally support the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lyrical, gothic register is consistent; POV stays tight without leakage. Dialogue is minimal yet functional, with the advisor’s lines carrying subtext and pressure.

    A consistent, lyrical third-person focalization with controlled diction and patterned rhythm suits the accumulative design. The perceptual signature (sound‑mapping of clouds, musicalized environment) feels distinctive. No head-hopping or stance wobble.

    A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (spirals, ridges, fractals) stays consistent. Diction and rhythm fit the character’s cartographic mind and modulate under pressure without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision works with the accumulative design.

    Consistent, close third with controlled lyric diction; “furrowed hush” motif threads voice and tone. Syntax varies and supports atmosphere; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature (technical noticing of poles/compass) and controlled rhythm. No head‑hopping; stance is stable. Some diction slips toward purple and repeats (“backlash of regrets,” “flickering faith”) dampening freshness. Slightly more modulation under peak beats would add torque.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    A distinct, steady lyric voice with controlled rhythm and pointed lexicon (“cathedral of algae,” “coded messages”) sustains POV without leakage. Psychic distance is stable; compression is purposeful. Minor diction recurrence (“labyrinth of choices”) nudges toward pattern wear, but the voice remains confident and coherent.

Diction and rhythm sustain poise without head‑hopping; the pattern of musical and geometric imagery feels taught and maintained. Absence of dialogue is fine; the voice carries action. Minor recurrence of phrasing flirts with sameness but does not break distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is consistently lyric with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled. Sparse dialogue carries subtext (“What rebellion hides in a cup?”) and advances plot.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and appropriate psychic distance, reflecting Mara's observant and analytical nature. The voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates well with the story's quiet, reflective tone. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the decaying world through the specific lens of a scientist seeking patterns, creating a cohesive and believable narrative mind.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is stable and the lyrical voice is generally consistent, creating a distinct narrative texture. However, the repeated use of specific phrases like "drifting resonance" and "steadily adaptive" reads more like a mechanical insertion of keywords than an organic part of the character's voice. This patterned repetition slightly flattens the voice and gives it an artificial quality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The point of view is impeccably controlled, with a consistent psychic distance that creates a lyrical, slightly melancholic voice. The narrative stance is confident, and the perceptual signature is strong, focusing on temperature, vibration, and memory. The prose rhythm and diction cohere into a distinct and memorable character voice without any slips.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, solemn tone that suits the material perfectly. The POV is controlled, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the mythic quality of the story. The prose has a strong rhythm and texture, but at times the elevated language feels more authorial than rooted in the weary undertaker's specific perceptual signature, creating a slight distance from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone. However, it frequently slips from a character-filtered POV into an authorial one that summarizes motivations and themes directly ("She understood that the sanctions were a test of solidarity..."). This tendency to tell rather than show distances the reader from Mara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a prose texture that matches the story's magical-realist tone. Milo's perceptual signature—noticing the "secret of bloom" or how grief tastes—is strong and character-specific. The point of view is stable, with no head-hopping. A minor deduction is for a slight psychic distance that sometimes reads more like a fable's narrator than a character's immediate internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice appropriate for the story's philosophical aims. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on abstract qualities of time, space, and light. While the prose is dense, the voice itself remains controlled and confident, modulating slightly with the activation of the maze. The psychic distance is expertly managed to create a sense of both intimacy with Mara's goal and awe at the cosmic scale of her project.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical third-person voice that aligns with its mythic ambitions. The point of view is stable and controlled. However, this stylistic choice creates a narrative distance that often describes Mara’s state ("staggering grace") rather than embodying her perception, keeping the reader an observer rather than a participant in her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is controlled, distinct, and possesses a compelling perceptual signature rooted in the character's synesthesia ("the faint teal of a dying rose"). The lyrical, elevated prose is sustained consistently, modulating with the emotional beats without losing its unique texture. The point of view is stable and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone, successfully maintaining the story's fantastical atmosphere. However, there is a mismatch between this poetic voice and the supposed "quietly savvy" nature of the protagonist. The prose feels more like a grand, external narration than the internal perspective of a shrewd thief.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, perfectly suiting the contemplative character. The POV is controlled, and the narrative distance is effective. The prose has a specific poetic texture, particularly in the unique choice to have her narrate her actions as a "liturgy," which deepens both character and theme without any technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and maintains a distinct perceptual signature through its focus on physical movement and internal sensation ("stunt-trained eye," "trembling certainty"). The POV is stable and psychic distance is well-controlled, modulating effectively with the rising tension. The prose has a distinct, if sometimes overwrought, texture that suits the fable-like quality of the narrative. No significant flaws in POV mechanics are present.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's voice is its defining feature: lyrical, elevated, and remarkably consistent from start to finish. This unwavering poetic register is perfectly suited to the mythic, conceptual nature of the narrative. While the voice lacks significant modulation, its distinct and memorable texture is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is controlled. The slightly formal, observant tone is appropriate for a sentient machine. However, the perceptual signature could be more distinct; phrases like "mundane mysticism" feel more like an authorial framing than a concept generated by the robot's own nascent consciousness, creating a slight psychic distance at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and maintains a controlled, elevated tone that suits the magical-realist mood. The point of view is stable and the prose has a distinct, if somewhat overwrought, texture. While competent, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally feeling like a collection of generic poetic constructions ("thoughts folded like origami") rather than a specific character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintained with impressive consistency, establishing a mythic, fairy-tale tone from the first sentence. The POV remains tightly focused on the vine dresser, and his perceptual signature—an attunement to the subtle life and decay of the garden—is the lens through which the entire story is filtered. The prose rhythm and elevated diction create a cohesive and memorable narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is masterful, maintaining a consistent lyrical and scientific tone that perfectly suits the story's contemplative mood. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythm, with narrative distance and focalization controlled expertly throughout the single, continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and masterfully sustains the story's gothic, melancholic tone. The prose has a distinct and controlled rhythm that enhances the atmosphere. The only minor shortcoming is that the elevated, poetic voice sometimes feels more authorial than character-particular, slightly distancing the reader from Mara’s immediate, grounded experience in favor of overarching mood.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is the story's most defining feature: a highly stylized, consistent, and confident blend of the technical and the poetic. Mirela's perceptual signature, where everything is filtered through a lens of measurable sorrow, is unique and memorable. The control of psychic distance is excellent, keeping the reader tightly bound to her internal experience without any slips.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct and establishes a memorable perceptual signature, particularly through the recurring motif of "drowsy alertness." The third-person limited POV is controlled and stable. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the high-register, figurative prose is sustained so consistently that its rhythm becomes monotonous, and the repetition of key phrases feels more like a tic than a purposeful cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice that suits its mythic subject matter. The point of view is stable and psychic distance is well-controlled. The prose has a distinct texture, though it occasionally suffers from syntactic uniformity, with a steady rhythm that could have benefited from more modulation to reflect the mounting pressure of the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for the character and tone. Psychic distance is well-managed, shifting closer during the performance. While the voice is pleasant and effective, it lacks a truly distinctive or surprising perceptual signature that would elevate it from highly competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and maintains a consistent elegiac tone appropriate for the character and setting. The close third-person POV offers a clear perceptual signature, filtering the world through the historian's specialized senses. Psychic distance is masterfully handled, creating an atmosphere of scholarly intimacy without ever breaking its formal, melancholic register.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and sustained throughout, creating a consistent tone of mythic realism. The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the elevated, poetic prose feels specific to this character and world. The psychic distance is managed well, creating a perceptual signature that makes the fantastical premise feel grounded and immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is highly controlled, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the mythic quality of the story. The point of view is stable and effective. However, the perceptual signature feels more authorial and stylistic than character-particular; the prose doesn't reveal a unique, biased mind so much as a consistent, ornate narrative style.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is the story's great strength: a sustained, lyrical, and distinct third-person limited POV that never wavers. The elevated diction and rhythmic prose perfectly embody Lian's internal state and perceptual signature ("upended hush," "phosphorescent memory"). The narrative stance is controlled, confident, and inseparable from the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is highly distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated tone. However, its relentless poetic register lacks modulation, causing the entire piece to read at the same high intensity, which becomes monotonous. Every sentence strives for profundity, creating a prose texture that is more of a stylistic mannerism than an effective, dynamic narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a distinct lyrical voice appropriate for the story's fable-like quality. The narrative distance is stable, and the character's perceptual signature, focused on vibration and texture, is well-realized. The prose has a unique rhythm, though it occasionally feels more like a generic literary "style" than a voice uniquely Marin's.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and contemplative tone. The prose carries a distinct, if somewhat uniform, rhythm. However, the narrative voice occasionally slips into a self-conscious register, explaining its own psychological processes ("Applying that method...") rather than letting the reader infer them from action, which creates a layer of narrative distance from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a close third-person perspective with a consistent and lyrical voice. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, evident in unique phrasing like "aromatically cautious" and the recurring "crystal shadows." The narrative stance modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the climax without any leaks or unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and establishes a distinct narrative stance. However, the psychic distance remains uniformly remote, presenting the poet's experience with an authorial, analytical clarity that feels external. The prose describes his internal state more than it embodies it, making the voice feel more like a philosophical narrator's than the character's own perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with strong control, and the voice is lyrical, distinct, and consistent. The narrator's "acoustically perceptive" nature provides a unique and effective perceptual signature that shapes how the world is rendered. The prose has a deliberate, poetic rhythm that aligns perfectly with the story's tone and protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining a poetic yet detached tone that aligns perfectly with the protagonist's character. The point of view is stable and the perceptual signature is strong. The score is limited by moments where the narrative voice shifts from Mara's immediate perception to a more abstract, explanatory register that summarizes the story's themes for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice is lyrical and distinct, with a gentle, rhythmic quality that perfectly matches the story's tone. Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—focused on quiet connections, sensory details, and emotional undercurrents—is coherent and well-executed throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is masterful, maintaining a consistent and distinct lyrical, fabulist tone throughout. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Arlen, and her perceptual signature shapes every description. The prose's rhythm and elevated diction create a unique texture that feels perfectly suited to the mythic quality of the narrative, with no unmotivated shifts in register or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is highly distinctive, consistent, and controlled, creating a potent, dreamlike mood from the first sentence. Mira’s perceptual signature as an illustrator who sees the world through light and form is expertly maintained. The only minor reservation is the uniformally elevated pitch, which offers little modulation, but the execution itself is confident and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone, and the third-person limited POV is cleanly maintained. The prose has a distinct, if not wholly original, texture suitable for a fable-like narrative. Psychic distance is managed well, keeping the reader close to the conjurer's contemplative state. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly unique perceptual signature; the observations and phrasing, while elegant, occasionally lean on familiar fantasy archetypes rather than forging a more idiosyncratic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that aligns with the "sapphire hush" atmosphere. The POV is stable, and the prose has a distinct rhythm. However, the narrative distance sometimes feels too great, with the voice reflecting the author's thematic concerns more than the specific, grounded perceptions of a "crawl space dweller." This creates a slight disconnect, where the character's inner world feels less like a unique consciousness and more like a narration of the story's concept.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, effectively filtering the world through Marlowe's gentle, scientific perspective. The point of view is stable and the psychic distance is well-controlled. Minor deductions are for a slightly self-conscious register and the repetition of key adjectival phrases that feel more like authorial labels than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent lyrical and melancholic tone that suits the story's atmosphere. The point of view remains stable, and the prose has a memorable texture. The main flaw is a subtle drift in psychic distance, where the narration occasionally pulls back to offer abstract summaries or thematic explanations that feel less like Mara's immediate perception and more like authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Point of view is stable, and the lyrical voice is consistent in its tone. The primary weakness is the lack of a distinct perceptual signature for the focalizer, Lira. Her internal voice is indistinguishable from the elevated narrative voice, making her thoughts feel authored rather than experienced. This fusion of narrator and character perspective dulls the immediacy of her internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent lyrical voice and a close psychic distance that suits the contemplative, mythic tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature; the world is filtered through the archivist's unique purpose, focusing on tides, echoes, and fragments. The narrative voice is the story's main engine, carrying the reader through what is essentially a series of resonant actions.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly sustained, creating a tone that marries meticulous observation with mystical wonder. The close third-person POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, and the protagonist's perceptual signature is distinct, always filtering the world through the lens of a mapper discovering a new kind of cartography. The prose has a distinct and memorable rhythm that serves the story's atmospheric goals flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and perfectly sustained, matching the contemplative, magical tone. The close third-person POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, and Lira's perceptual signature—attentive to both cosmic patterns and precise details—is entirely convincing. The prose rhythm and texture are controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly suited to an ancient, detached being. The elevated, formal prose creates a unique perceptual signature that feels authentic to the character. Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, maintaining a sense of immense scale while keeping the internal stakes immediate. The brief lines of dialogue are the weakest point, feeling more like thematic devices than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, slightly formal tone that befits the story’s mythic quality. Point of view remains firmly locked with Mara, and psychic distance is well-managed. The prose has a clear rhythm, but the perceptual signature is not deeply idiosyncratic; the descriptions, while evocative, sometimes rely on familiar constructions ("swirl like a midnight river," "veins of gold") rather than a uniquely personal way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a perceptual signature that is integral to the story's effect. The psychic distance is well-controlled. A minor weakness is the slight overuse of key conceptual words ("refract," "textures"), which can occasionally make the voice feel more performative than innate, but the overall control is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and impeccably maintained, establishing a melancholic and observant tone from the first sentence. The protagonist's perceptual signature, focused on textures, layers, and fragments, is strong and consistent, shaping every description. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the story's pacing, creating a confident and immersive narrative experience that feels unique to this character.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and controlled, establishing a distinct narrative stance. However, the prose occasionally feels more authorial than character-bound, with phrases like "gloomy cheerfulness" repeated like a label. The psychic distance remains stable and effective, but the voice's texture is so uniformly elevated that it can feel slightly detached from the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is clear and controlled. However, the psychic distance remains too great throughout, contributing to the story's summary-like feel and preventing a deep sense of interiority or immediacy. The prose has a slightly elevated, descriptive texture that is pleasant but lacks a distinctive character-specific perceptual signature; it describes Mira's world capably but doesn't feel like we are seeing it *through* her unique mind.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is controlled and the voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the story's elegiac mood. The prose carries a distinct, melancholic rhythm that effectively builds atmosphere. The only minor weakness is that the voice sometimes feels more like a disembodied literary narrator than the specific perceptual filter of a "purposefully curious" inspector on a technical mission.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, creating a distinct perceptual signature tied to Mara's non-visual senses. The voice is lyrical and consistent, with prose rhythm and word choice that perfectly reflect her focused, "magnetic calm." The narrative successfully maintains its close psychic distance, ensuring every observation feels filtered through her unique and sharply honed awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is controlled and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. The prose itself has a strong, rhythmic quality. The primary flaw is a mismatch between this voice and the protagonist's stated "dry-witted" characterization; her perceptual signature reads more as a myth-keeper than a sarcastic editor, creating a slight but persistent break in voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is masterful: controlled, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the story's mythic tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm and a specific, elevated lexicon that remains consistent, creating a strong perceptual signature for the tuner's experience. Point of view is stable, and psychic distance is expertly managed.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is mostly stable and the voice is lyrical, but it breaks significantly in the final paragraphs. The shift to describe what "strangers who heard her distress signal... later whispered" is an unmotivated move to an omniscient narrator. This undermines the established single-POV intimacy and serves as a less effective, told-not-shown resolution for the distress signal plot thread.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is distinct and consistently maintained, creating a fable-like quality. The point of view is controlled without any slips. The only weakness is a slight register mismatch; the sophisticated syntax and vocabulary feel more authorial than character-bound, creating a distance from the boy's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical, and highly distinct narrative voice from a close third-person POV. The prose has a specific texture and rhythm that perfectly matches the ghostly, melancholic subject matter. The focalization remains tightly controlled, with a perceptual signature that filters all details through the bride's mournful but purposeful perspective, creating a seamless and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story establishes and maintains a distinct and consistent poetic voice, which is its primary aesthetic achievement. The POV is stable and the perceptual signature is strong, filtering all details through a serene, mythic sensibility. The voice's primary limitation is its lack of modulation; it remains at the same lyrical pitch throughout, which slightly flattens the narrative's dynamic potential but is otherwise highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The point of view is stable and the elevated, lyrical voice is consistently maintained, suiting the story's tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature particular to Mara. It reads more like a skilled, omniscient narrator describing events poetically rather than filtering the world through a unique and biased consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent tone of "futuristic nostalgia" throughout, demonstrating strong control. The elevated, lyrical prose creates a memorable atmosphere. However, the psychic distance remains fixed and the voice lacks modulation, resulting in a monolithic texture that could have been more dynamic by shifting in response to the ritual's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a potent mythic tone. The third-person limited POV is controlled effectively for almost the entire piece, immersing the reader in the embroiderer's unique perceptual world. A notable flaw occurs in the final paragraph with the unmotivated shift to a more omniscient, historical perspective ("History would remember..."), which briefly breaks the established POV frame right at the story's conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is consistent and fitting for a "cryptic medium," maintaining a stable psychic distance. The prose has a distinct texture, though its rhythmic consistency sometimes verges on monotonous. The biggest flaw is the verbatim repetition of the phrase "messages in condensation on windows," which reads like a mechanical artifact rather than an organic part of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece maintains a consistent and lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature. The voice is elevated and controlled, effectively filtering the world through the translator's unique metaphorical lens. The primary limitation is its monolithic quality; the prose operates at a single, sustained pitch without significant modulation, even under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's fairy-tale tone. The prose maintains a controlled, dreamy quality that suits the material. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling like a generalized, omniscient narrator rather than filtering the world through the specific consciousness of a "vivid mural artist."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is distinct and consistently lyrical, creating a specific texture. The prose rhythm, however, tends towards monotony with its recurring sentence structures. The elevated, metaphorical voice feels more like an authorial overlay than a deeply integrated character perception, lacking a truly unique perceptual signature for Lena herself.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone and psychic distance. The prose has a unique texture that suits the story's magical-realist quality. However, the perceptual signature feels more aligned with a poetic narrator than the specific interiority of the "charming rogue scholar," occasionally sacrificing character-particular detail for elevated, abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and maintains a controlled, elevated psychic distance that befits a mythic tale. The POV offers a strong perceptual signature, filtering every observation through metaphors of sea, light, and botany. While the poetic register is sustained beautifully, it lacks significant modulation even under pressure, creating a somewhat monolithic but undeniably immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is singular, lyrical, and sustained with impressive control, creating a consistent and immersive narrative texture. The POV is locked tightly, and the caretaker's perceptual signature—her focus on light, sound, and fragile objects—is distinct and unwavering. While the elevated, poetic register is highly effective, it maintains a uniform rhythm that could benefit from slight modulation to heighten key moments of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is masterful, maintaining a consistent lyrical and scholarly tone that perfectly suits the character and subject matter. The point of view demonstrates a distinct perceptual signature, heavily biased toward sound and light, which enhances the story's magical atmosphere. Narrative distance is expertly controlled, modulating subtly with the intensity of Elara's focus without any unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a consistent and distinct narrative voice, characterized by a lyrical, elevated tone and a stable third-person POV. However, the voice lacks modulation; its unvarying richness can feel monotonous, creating a static narrative distance that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting the character's immediate experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    The voice is lyrical, distinctive, and sustained with excellent control. The point of view remains tightly focused, and the prose's rhythm and perceptual signature are specific to Lila's contemplative state. The narrative distance is expertly managed, modulating effectively as her internal state shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is exceptionally controlled, maintaining a lyrical, quiet intensity that perfectly matches the “fractured hush” of the tone. The third-person limited POV has a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on sensory details like hums, vibrations, and grains that are specific to this character and world. Psychic distance is masterfully handled, creating an intimate yet mythic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story maintains a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice from a stable close-third-person POV. Psychic distance is well-controlled, and the prose’s texture—its specific vocabulary and rhythmic syntax—is a primary driver of the narrative's effect. The voice is confident and artfully sustained throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person POV with a distinct and confident voice.

Psychic distance is well-controlled, and the narrative voice feels singular and purposeful, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience without any technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, with a lyrical and elevated tone that suits the analytical performer. However, the voice is compromised when it slips into direct thematic summary, as these moments read less like the character's internal perspective and more like the author's thesis statement. This creates a distance and reduces the POV's immersive quality at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative voice is the story's signature strength, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and elevated tone that perfectly suits the material. The prose has a distinct rhythm and a specific perceptual signature, filtering the magical events through Lira's focused consciousness. Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, creating an immersive and authoritative telling.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice has a significant register problem. The highly lyrical, abstract, and academic diction ("noctilucent," "filaments," "reckonings," "ledger") feels imposed upon, rather than emerging from, a "harbor glazier." This creates a lack of authenticity, where the character's perceptual signature seems to belong to the author's poetic sensibility rather than a specific, embodied individual.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and maintains a controlled, elevated tone that matches the story's fable-like quality. The POV is locked tightly on Maren, and her perceptual signature—a focus on scars, light, and ash—is distinct. The prose has a clear rhythm, though it occasionally feels mannered and overly poetic, sacrificing immediacy for a sustained, lofty register.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice that aligns with its fantastical premise and the protagonist's intellectual nature. The point of view is stable and the narrative distance is well-controlled. The prose, however, sometimes settles into a uniform rhythm of complex sentences, which can slightly dull the narrative momentum, particularly in passages that summarize action rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story’s melancholic, mysterious tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Lira's focus on sound and memory. The voice modulates effectively with the intensity of the discovery, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the narrative. The third-person limited POV is controlled, focusing tightly on the painter's perceptions and actions. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the prose rhythm remains uniformly graceful even as the tension of the "hush" supposedly intensifies, missing an opportunity for the voice to reflect the rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Point of view is consistent, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling more like a detached, elevated narrator than a close third-person perspective filtered through Lira. The prose is formal and controlled but also generic, relying on grand but familiar phrasing ("celestial bodies," "fragile magnificence") that keeps the character at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a consistent, elevated, and slightly detached voice that perfectly suits the character's grandiosity and private sentimentality. The narrator’s perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on resonance, echoes, and geometry. The prose has a deliberate, rhythmic quality that supports the story's mythic feel without a single slip in psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story's voice is its greatest strength: a sustained, lyrical, and highly distinct narrative stance that feels inseparable from the character and world. The point of view is controlled, and the prose has a unique perceptual signature, exemplified by lines like "The air tasted of ice and ink." This control creates a cohesive and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, contemplative psychic distance appropriate for the story's aims. The prose has a specific texture that reflects Selene's philosophical mind, with complex syntax and elevated diction feeling purposeful. The point of view is controlled and stable, effectively filtering all perception through the character's specific, focused quest for understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is highly distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and elevated tone that establishes a potent, dreamlike mood. The narrative's perceptual signature, with its focus on light, color, and synesthesia ("orange whispers"), is memorable and controlled. While the unwavering elevation of the voice is a strong artistic choice, it lacks some modulation, creating a single, sustained note that could have benefited from more dynamic shifts in rhythm to reflect internal pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece maintains a consistent and lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct narrative voice. The prose texture is controlled and purposeful, fitting the solemn, magical tone. The score is slightly limited by a uniformly elevated register that can feel performative and by minor repetitive phrasing that creates small, noticeable seams in an otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, ethereal tone appropriate for the mythic subject matter. The point of view is stable, and the character's perceptual signature (seeing past/future) is a core component of the narrative frame. While effective, the voice relies on a somewhat familiar high-fantasy register and lacks a truly idiosyncratic texture that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, formal tone, and the third-person limited POV is maintained without slips. However, the voice is compromised by the artificial and repetitive use of specific keywords ("uncloak," "dusky harmony," "empirically ironic"). This tic makes the narration feel less like a character's genuine perspective and more like a response to a constrained writing exercise, dulling its authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, lyrical, and fable-like tone that suits the material. The psychic distance is stable, treating the events with a sense of legendary remove. However, the voice lacks a strong, particular perceptual signature rooted in Mara; it reads more like a disembodied storyteller than a character's filtered experience, which keeps the reader at an emotional distance from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and masterfully sustained, creating a consistent fable-like tone that suits the material perfectly. The point of view is controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in the protagonist's craft and worldview (e.g., "remember forgotten skies," "glass-mountain tone"). There are no technical slips, and the prose itself functions as a core part of the story's incantatory power.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrical, distinctive, and consistently maintained, establishing a gentle, reflective tone that suits the narrative. The third-person limited POV remains tightly controlled, filtering all sensory details and internal thoughts through Lira’s perspective. Psychic distance is managed well, drawing close for the delicate mending process and pulling back for moments of thematic reflection, creating a coherent and immersive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated, and intellectual tone appropriate for a scholarly curator grappling with cosmic ideas. The point of view is stable and effectively filters the strange events through the protagonist's bewildered but determined perspective. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; its vocabulary is sophisticated, but the sentence structure and rhythm are somewhat uniform, missing an opportunity for the prose itself to reflect the mind-bending concepts at play.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and maintains a fittingly arcane and elevated tone. The third-person POV remains locked cleanly on Selene's actions and knowledge. However, the voice feels more like a grand, omniscient storyteller than a deep dive into Selene's specific perceptual signature; its texture is tied to the mythic setting rather than the protagonist's unique mind, which slightly limits its distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is the story's most defining and successful feature, establishing a distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained perspective. The prose has a unique perceptual signature that filters the world through a mythological lens. While the relentlessly elevated register could benefit from more dynamic modulation, the control and execution are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical tone appropriate for a fable-like story. POV is tightly controlled, and the prose has a distinct rhythm. While skillfully executed, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally feeling like a perfected version of a familiar literary fantasy style rather than a voice entirely its own, which holds it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone appropriate for the fantastical setting. The POV is controlled and stable, with a clear perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. The score is held back by the conspicuous repetition of key phrases ("gently luminous," "hammered repose," "bloom of hush"), which creates a slightly mechanical cadence rather than an organic, resonant echo.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent lyrical, almost mythic tone throughout. However, the point of view feels slightly detached, with a narrator who sometimes describes his own emotional state with an articulateness that lessens its immediacy. The prose is controlled, but the narrative distance remains uniform, missing opportunities for modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is masterful—elevated, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the "summer-quill archivist." The POV is controlled with a distinct and consistent perceptual signature focused on history, memory, and subtle environmental shifts. The syntax and rhythm are controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively to create a sense of deepening introspection, which makes the prose itself a key part of the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and maintains a controlled, elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. However, the point of view feels more like a camera describing the character's internal state than a deep immersion within it. The narrative distance, while consistent, prevents the prose from fully embodying a unique, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a consistent, lyrical voice that perfectly matches the story's contemplative mood. The chronicler’s perceptual signature is distinct and unwavering; we experience the world through her specific, sensory focus. The prose rhythm and sentence structure are controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively with the story's quiet tension.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is masterful—a consistent, lyrical third-person POV that perfectly matches the story's magical-realist tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Lio's unique sensibility and desires. POV control is absolute, with no slips in distance or knowledge, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and maintains a distinct, meditative tone throughout. The third-person limited POV stays cleanly with Lira, and her perceptions shape the prose. However, the narrative voice sometimes slips into an overly explanatory mode that feels external to the character's immediate experience, as seen in the slightly clunky phrase, "The vial’s fluid was a fluidly logical mixture of minerals." This momentarily breaks the otherwise immersive psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical precision, and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, descriptive tone. The prose establishes a clear mood appropriate for the story's content. The voice, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature particular to the character; Mina's internal experience feels largely indistinguishable from the omniscient-adjacent descriptive narration, making the voice functional and atmospheric but not truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is highly distinct, establishing a consistent lyrical and solemn tone from the first sentence that is perfectly suited to the mythic material. The point of view is stable, with a controlled psychic distance that maintains the story's fable-like quality. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the narrative prose maintains the same elevated, rhythmic intensity throughout, slightly flattening the dynamic shift between moments of quiet ritual and climactic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and well-suited to the reflective, cautious protagonist. The prose maintains a consistent poetic texture that enhances the story's surreal atmosphere without becoming distracting. Point of view is stable, and the small amount of dialogue serves its purpose effectively, differentiating Lira's voice from the protagonist's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice appropriate for the story's aims. The prose has a distinct texture, and the narrative distance is stable. The character's perceptual signature is clear, focused on sound, light, and intuition. The voice feels slightly more authored than embodied, with conceptual phrases sometimes seeming imposed upon the character's thoughts rather than emerging from them.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice appropriate for its mythic tone. The point of view is stable, and the narrative distance feels controlled. The prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature. The main limitation is that the voice sometimes feels more authorial than character-bound; the knight's internal experience is filtered through a highly stylized prose that can distance the reader from his immediate perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the material. The close third-person POV is handled cleanly. However, the prose sometimes falls into repetitive syntactic patterns ("She lifted it... She set it... She traced... She wrote..."), creating a slightly mechanical cadence that can blunt the emotional texture of the otherwise evocative language.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story's voice is its most defining feature—a consistent, elevated, lyrical prose that establishes a mythic tone. While distinctive and controlled, this choice creates a notable psychic distance from the protagonist. We observe Mara through a legendary filter rather than experiencing the events from within her immediate, stressed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for a fable-like narrative. The POV is controlled and the perceptual signature is strong, focused on light, mist, and sound. However, the prose's rhythmic and syntactic patterns become monotonous, slightly dulling the voice's impact through repetition rather than modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the mythic quality of the story. The third-person limited POV maintains a distinct and controlled perceptual signature, filtering the magical events through Lira's evolving senses. The prose has a specific texture and rhythm that effectively builds the story's unique atmosphere without slipping in register or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Point of view is tightly controlled, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story's reflective nature. The prose has a distinct texture, and psychic distance is managed well, shifting closer during moments of discovery. While very well-executed, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it to an exceptional level; it is highly competent but not unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, measured register. This control is a strength. The voice’s primary limitation is its lack of modulation; it maintains its elevated, almost academic tone even during the peak of the delicate operation, creating a slight emotional distance where more immediacy could have heightened the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, mythic tone appropriate for the material. POV is controlled and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and light. The prose rhythm supports the mood, though a few instances of declarative interiority ("She knew," "She understood") create moments of psychic distance where immediacy would be more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a high, lyrical register that suits the metaphysical premise. However, the diction feels more authorial than character-bound at times. The use of abstract, academic-sounding concepts ("proprioceptively enhanced," "geometry of compassion," "mathematics of mercy") within the POV's internal monologue can create a distance, making it read more like a philosophical fable than a raw, personal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is the story's greatest strength: lyrical, consistent, and possessing a distinct perceptual signature that perfectly matches the "between-worlds translator" role. The prose rhythm, word choice, and syntax create a cohesive and immersive experience. POV is masterfully controlled, filtering every detail through a specific, memorable consciousness without a single slip.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, literary voice that effectively builds atmosphere. The prose has a specific texture and rhythm, and the psychic distance is well-managed. The only minor weakness is the repetitive labeling of the protagonist's key trait ("skillfully observant"), which feels slightly redundant when her actions already demonstrate this quality so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical, consistent, and maintains a distinct elevated tone appropriate for the material. The third-person POV remains tightly focused on Mara. The primary weakness is that the voice's polished, descriptive quality can create distance, at times reading more like a beautiful myth being recounted than a character's immediate, embodied experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, perfectly aligning with a "poetically inclined" protagonist. The point of view remains tightly controlled, and the prose's texture—its rhythm and elevated diction—is the story's signature. While the voice is so uniformly stylized that it sometimes risks eclipsing the character's specific personality, it succeeds as a coherent and immersive stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's voice is its most distinctive and consistent feature. The lyrical, almost fairy-tale-like prose ("tinkersong wonder," "a lullaby that mirrored the ticking of sunrise") is sustained beautifully from start to finish. The third-person limited POV remains tightly controlled on Alder, and his perceptions shape the narrative texture in a way that feels both unique and perfectly suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is distinct, controlled, and maintains a consistent literary tone that perfectly matches the story's lyrical, wondrous mood. The third-person limited POV is executed flawlessly, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Mara's obsession with sensory details like scent and texture. Psychic distance is managed effectively, drawing the reader close during moments of discovery and awe without any intrusive narration.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is consistently held, but the narrative voice feels artificial. Mira's internal monologue uses a high-register, academic lexicon ("scaffold," "metaphor," "layered meanings") that clashes with the raw, elemental setting and the supposed immediacy of her inspiration. This creates a distance, making the voice feel more like a detached narrator's analysis than a character's authentic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)

However, the prose is marred by mechanical repetition of key phrases ("woven dawns," "burnished hush," "kite string snaps"), which makes the voice feel formulaic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, but the story is critically flawed by an inexplicable point-of-view break in the first sentence. The opening “I arrived” establishes a first-person narrator who immediately vanishes, replaced by a third-person limited perspective on Mira.

    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the "dire enchantment." The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice suffers from a register mismatch. The highly formal, academic diction ("occlude," "covenant," "communal mirror") feels at odds with the character's profession as a forager, creating a voice that seems imposed by the author rather than organic to the character. This lack of a distinct perceptual signature tied to her supposed role makes the voice feel generic and overly literary.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the story. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Marlowe's perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's lyrical, earnest tone.

While technically proficient, the voice lacks a truly distinctive, idiosyncratic quality that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical, introspective voice is distinct and consistently maintained, establishing a clear narrative texture. However, the voice's high level of self-analytical articulation feels more like a meta-commentary on the character's process than a genuine internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    The point of view is controlled and stable, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Lena's anosmia. The focus on touch, vibration, and filtered sight is consistent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is consistent and the lyrical voice is well-sustained, creating a distinct narrative texture. However, the prose relies on repetitive key phrases ("a breath between storms," "a saturated hush") that feel more like authorial motifs than the character's organic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, metaphorical register, but its uniformity feels more like a sustained stylistic performance than a character-specific perceptual signature. This highly controlled style, while atmospheric, lacks the subtle shifts in rhythm and perception that would signal a mind under pressure, making the voice feel somewhat artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is distinct, elevated, and maintained with impressive consistency, creating a powerful incantatory tone. However, it remains at a single, high-flown pitch throughout, lacking modulation that could reflect shifts in pressure.

    The voice is distinct, consistent, and maintains a lyrical, contemplative tone appropriate for the story's aims. The point of view is stable and focalization is controlled. However, the prose register remains uniformly elevated and philosophical, even during the storm, which creates a sense of detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the voice is burdened by an overly academic register that feels inorganic ("theoretically rebellious," "widen perspectives responsibly"). The narration relies heavily on filter verbs and summary ("She knew," "She realized," "She understood"), which distances the reader from the immediacy of Mara's experience. This creates a voice that explains the journey rather than embodying it.

    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone and psychic distance appropriate for the story’s contemplative nature. The prose possesses a clear perceptual signature, filtering the world through Mara’s unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)

    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for a modern fable, and the point of view remains stable. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through a melancholic and determined lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a detached, formal tone that suits the character and atmosphere.

    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and maintains a distinct, elevated tone that suits the material.

    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and slightly mythic tone that suits the material. Point of view is controlled, and the prose has a clear rhythmic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control, and the voice has a consistent lyrical quality. However, the narrative voice occasionally wavers between poetic description and a detached, clinical register when describing the protagonist's internal coping mechanisms.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent psychic distance for most of the story. The primary flaw is the abrupt, un-signaled shift in point of view to the violinist in the final paragraph.

    The narrative voice is distinct and poetic, with a stable psychic distance for most of the story. A significant flaw occurs at the climax with an unmotivated POV shift to the shopkeeper ("She felt the ghost's longing..."). This head-hop, combined with the magical transference of the coin into her palm, breaks the established focalization at a crucial moment, disrupting narrative control.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is compromised by a highly academic register that feels detached from an in-the-moment experience. The prose has a distinct but overly clinical texture, dominated by jargon that creates a perceptual filter of intellectual abstraction rather than sensory immediacy. This voice, while consistent, prioritizes explaining the concept over inhabiting the character, keeping the reader at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story's mystical tone, maintaining a stable and effective psychic distance. The POV is controlled, and the prose carries a distinct perceptual signature. Minor deductions are for occasional phrases like "factually mystical" that read more like an authorial label than a character's specific, organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a stable and effective third-person limited POV with a distinct, lyrical voice that is well-suited to the fantastical material. The prose has a consistent texture and rhythm, and the narrator's perceptual signature is clear. Psychic distance is managed well, modulating slightly to match the quiet intensity of Mara's focus without any unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, establishing a mythic tone from the opening line. The point of view remains stable and controlled. The primary weakness is a slight mismatch between the elevated, fable-like prose and the grounded concept of a "burned spy," creating a psychic distance that occasionally holds the reader at arm's length from the character's raw internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent in its tone. However, the voice suffers from a register mismatch, feeling more authorial than specific to the character of a coachman. The repeated use of key phrases ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity") gives the prose a mechanical quality, creating a perceptual signature that feels imposed rather than organic to the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is highly distinctive, with a consistent lyrical rhythm and a strong perceptual signature focused on subtle vibrations and light. The POV is flawlessly maintained, filtering the world through Mara's serene consciousness. The primary limitation is a slight lack of modulation; the poetic register remains at a high pitch throughout, which can feel more performative than authentically internal at times, though it is consistent with the established character.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct narrative voice that is lyrical and perceptive. The prose texture is rich, and the narrator's focus—her perceptual signature—is convincingly tied to her purpose as a gardener of neglected spaces. The voice effectively carries the story's tone of quiet determination and vulnerability, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice is lyrical and controlled. The prose maintains a distinct, elevated tone that suits the fantastical setting. However, the narrative voice lacks a strong, particular character signature; it often feels like a detached, poetic narrator rather than Mira's own specific way of perceiving the world, keeping the reader at a slight emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is controlled, and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and sustained with impressive consistency. The prose has a clear rhythmic and perceptual signature that aligns perfectly with Mira's contemplative character. Psychic distance is managed well, creating an immersive, atmospheric reading experience without any slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is flawlessly maintained with a stable psychic distance that suits the story’s mythic, fable-like quality. The voice is distinct, blending technical jargon with elevated, almost lyrical prose ("ethereal grit," "celestial signal interpreter") to create a memorable and consistent narrative texture. The prose itself has a clear perceptual signature rooted in Mara's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and lyrical, maintaining a formal, mythic tone that suits the material. The third-person limited POV is controlled, effectively filtering the fantastical events through the explorer’s paradoxical mindset of fear and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-controlled, establishing a distinct and fitting tone from the first sentence. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Mara, and her perceptions are filtered effectively through her blindness, prioritizing texture and sound. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, and its rhythm modulates effectively with the rising emotional intensity without losing its core texture.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained from Mara's close third-person POV. The prose has a specific texture that aligns with the story's atmospheric goals. The control of psychic distance is solid, effectively modulating between action and Mara's internal state without any unmotivated shifts or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for a modern fable. The point of view is controlled, with a clear perceptual signature focused on light, sound, and memory. However, the voice's texture is somewhat monolithic; it lacks modulation even under pressure, which can make the prose feel more like a sustained authorial performance than a character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly aligned with Arlen's character, creating a consistent perceptual signature. The prose rhythm and lyrical quality are sustained effectively across the story's emotional shifts.

    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a dreamlike and elevated tone. The point of view is stable and serves the story's aims well. The prose's texture is memorable, though its uniformly lofty register sometimes keeps the reader at a slight psychic distance from Mara's immediate experience, feeling more narrated than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice with a distinct high-fantasy register. The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative stance is confident. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering all details through a mythic, serious lens. However, the voice is hampered by the line-level execution, where relentless lyricism occasionally overwhelms clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is consistent and maintains a distinct texture appropriate for a mythic fantasy. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on the visionary's internal journey. The main limitation is that the perceptual signature, while poetic, can feel generic to the archetype, lacking idiosyncratic details that would make this specific visionary's mind feel unique under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece establishes a distinct, lyrical voice, but it is undermined by repetitive phrasing. The recurrence of key descriptors like "dusky resolve" and "trammel" reads less like a deliberate motif and more like a stylistic tic. This pattern-looping flattens the narrative voice and makes it feel more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent world-weary and reflective tone that feels authentic to the character. The point of view is controlled, maintaining a close psychic distance that supports the internal journey. While the prose is generally strong, a few moments of overly abstract phrasing ("a paradox that made each breath feel both measured and boundless") create a slight drift from the otherwise grounded perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, slightly lyrical and scholarly tone that fits the character. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on frequencies, vibrations, and unseen currents, which aligns with Lira's worldview. While effective, the voice occasionally uses abstract constructions where more concrete sensory details could have enhanced the immediacy of Lira's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent, lyrical voice and an appropriate psychic distance that suits the mythic quality of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and maintains a controlled, elevated tone that suits the material. The POV remains tightly focused on Mara. The primary weakness is that the prose, while beautiful, lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the lyrical descriptions feel more like an authorial overlay than a reflection of this specific character's way of seeing the world. This creates a voice that is effective but not exceptionally memorable or particular.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct and lyrically consistent, but its highly analytical and polished nature creates a distance from the "raw solace" it describes. The POV feels overly confident in its self-diagnosis, using phrases ("daringly methodical," "cartography of the soul") that sound more like an author's notes than a character's internal monologue. This register clash slightly undermines the emotional immediacy of the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the material. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic narrator for a fable than a specific individual. The repetition of key phrases, especially "cautious exuberance," becomes a verbal tic that flattens the narrator's voice rather than deepens it.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, melancholic tone that suits the story. The point of view remains tightly focused on Elara, with a controlled psychic distance. However, the prose can feel monolithic; the syntax and rhythm lack modulation, creating a uniform texture that doesn't always reflect the rising emotional intensity of the scene. The voice is strong but would benefit from more dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is masterful, maintaining a consistent lyrical and reverent tone that perfectly matches the story's premise. The third-person POV remains tightly controlled, filtering all perception through the protagonist's focused, sensory awareness of light, vibration, and silence. The prose has a distinct, memorable rhythm and texture, demonstrating a high level of control over narrative distance and psychic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. The prose has a distinct texture that effectively supports the story's quiet, contemplative mood. There's a slight weakness in that the voice can feel more authorial than character-specific, with elaborate descriptions ("her heart scalloping with a rhythm that mirrored the gentle rolling of vineyard hills") that feel imposed rather than emerging from the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is highly distinct, with a lyrical and consistent third-person limited POV that establishes a clear perceptual signature for Mara. However, the prose is so relentlessly elevated and metaphorical that it occasionally feels strained, sacrificing momentum for texture. The voice's integrity is maintained, but its density borders on being overwrought, slightly obscuring the action it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, successfully establishing the story's contemplative, mythical tone. The third-person POV is stable and controlled. The primary weakness is that the narrative voice and the character's internal voice are nearly indistinguishable, flattening Mira's perceptual signature into the story's overarching, elevated style without sufficient modulation for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the mythic, contemplative tone. POV distance is expertly controlled. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture. The character's perceptual signature, however, hews closely to a serene mystic archetype, lacking idiosyncratic biases or flaws that would make the voice feel more unique and less a perfect vessel for the story's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the story's melancholic yet hopeful tone.

    The voice is controlled, consistent, and maintains a fittingly poetic and contemplative tone throughout. The point of view is stable and effectively filtered through Silas's perspective.

    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent in establishing the "plausible impossibility" tone. The prose has a clear perceptual signature rooted in gentle, observant magic. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the voice maintains such a uniformly elevated and poetic register that it verges on feeling overwrought and monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrical, distinctive, and consistently maintained, establishing a contemplative and melancholic tone that suits the story perfectly. The third-person limited POV is controlled, with a psychic distance that shifts appropriately to convey both Caitlyn’s methodical actions and her internal realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece maintains a consistent and controlled third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is distinct, with a consistent poetic and slightly mythic register. The POV is well-controlled. The main weakness is its monolithic quality; the elevated tone rarely modulates, and key phrases like "soundless echo" are repeated to the point of becoming a tic, slightly dulling their impact rather than deepening it with each use.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a stable, philosophical tone appropriate for an "ego death survivor." However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading as a detached narrator explaining concepts rather than a character experiencing them. The prose prioritizes abstract ideas over sensory, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, keeping the focus tightly on Mara’s perspective and creative vision. The narrative voice is lyrical and consistent, though it sometimes drifts toward overly abstract or ornate phrasing ("unfurl like a map of constellations drawn in vapor"). While generally effective, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would make the voice unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The point of view is stable and controlled. However, the prose is so stylized that the voice feels more authorial and omniscient than tightly bound to the conductor's specific perceptions, creating a slight distance from his immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story possesses a distinct and consistent narrative voice that is lyrical, elevated, and perfectly suited to the mystical tone. The third-person limited POV remains tightly controlled, effectively filtering the world through the guardian's unique, non-human perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. However, the voice lacks modulation; its texture remains uniform even as the experiment reaches its climax, creating a sense of emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, lyrical tone appropriate for the genre. The prose effectively filters the world through Selin's professional, yet wondrous, perspective. While competent and controlled, the voice lacks a truly distinct, idiosyncratic signature that would make it unforgettable; it feels more like a well-executed genre voice than a unique character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, ethereal tone appropriate for the subject matter. The third-person limited POV is stable. However, the narrative distance occasionally wavers, especially in the concluding paragraphs, which shift from Lio's immediate experience into a more detached, summary-like mode that explains the story's meaning and future state.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and maintains a consistent psychic distance that aligns with the architect's detached persona. The prose has a unique, elevated texture. A minor weakness is the repetitive use of specific compound phrases ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary"), which occasionally feel like authorial tics rather than organic elements of the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated, and poetic tone that suits the story's mood. The POV is cleanly controlled. The story's main weakness in this area is the dialogue at the very end, where the students' question serves as a generic prompt for the instructor's thematic explanation, feeling less like natural speech and more like an authorial device.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is highly distinct, consistent, and controlled, establishing a lyrical and melancholic tone from the first sentence. The protagonist's "perceptual signature" as a poetic observer ("cartographer of sighs") is well-maintained and filters all sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent lyrical and melancholic tone that serves the story well, and POV control is flawless.

    The voice is lyrical, controlled, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for a fable. The third-person limited POV is stable and effectively filters the magical reality through Mara's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is the story's defining feature: lyrical, elevated, and perfectly consistent with the fantastical-academic concept.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is consistent and well-suited to the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone, and the third-person limited POV remains stable. The prose maintains a distinct rhythm appropriate for a fable. However, the voice lacks a unique perceptual signature, relying on a common stock of cosmic and abstract vocabulary ("cosmic possibility," "enveloped secrets") that feels more like a genre exercise than an individual's perspective. It's competent but lacks the specificity for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a lyrical and atmospheric voice. The protagonist's perceptual signature is clear—she sees the world in terms of mythic energy and constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and maintains a distinct texture. The third-person limited POV is stable and effective for the story's fairy-tale quality.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and highly effective in establishing the story's mythic, reverent tone.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical distance. The voice has a distinct, elevated texture that suits the quasi-mystical subject matter. However, the perceptual signature sometimes feels more like a generic poetic narrator than a specific, individual map framer. The prose is elegant, but its consistency slightly flattens the character's unique way of seeing the world into the story's overall tone.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and melancholic tone. However, the prose has a uniform texture and register, reading more like an authorial meditation than the specific internal voice of the character, Mort.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and tonally appropriate for a gentle fable, maintaining a stable, slightly distant third-person POV.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is highly stylized and consistent in its lyrical, elevated register, creating a distinct narrative texture. However, the uniformity of the rhythm and syntactic patterns creates a somewhat monotonous cadence that doesn't modulate enough with the rising tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is exceptionally strong, maintaining a consistent lyrical and melancholic tone that defines the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the voice possesses a distinct, poetic-scientific texture. The narrative stance is consistent, and the prose rhythm reflects Mara's contemplative state.

    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and lyrical voice that suits the mythic quality of the narrative. Lir's perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through the language of taste and texture ("bitter as burnt cumin, yet underscored with a bright citrus"). The prose rhythm is controlled, modulating effectively to match the deliberate, ritualistic pace of the chef's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct narrative voice. The prose has a specific texture and rhythm that supports the atmospheric, fairy-tale quality of the story. The psychic distance is stable and the narrator's perceptual signature is clear, focused on sound, light, and harmony. The score is capped by a slight monotony in sentence structure and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and stylistically ambitious, fitting the speculative, lyrical concept. Unfortunately, its effectiveness is compromised by the conspicuous repetition of key phrases ("helix-minded," "chaotically precise," "archeologist of abandoned dreams"). These repetitions feel less like intentional motifs and more like narrative tics from a template, which slightly flattens the voice and creates a sense of mechanical construction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the genre. However, the perceptual signature feels constrained and artificial due to the heavy repetition of specific compound adjectives and phrases ("clandestinely luminous," "prism-minded"). This stylistic tic makes the voice feel less like a unique character's perspective and more like an exercise in fulfilling lexical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is lyrical and consistent, maintaining a distinct, elevated tone that matches the fairy-tale quality of the narrative. The third-person limited POV is handled cleanly. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the prose maintains the same high-lyrical register throughout, which can feel monotonous. The sentence structure and vocabulary choices create a distinct texture, but this texture rarely changes to reflect shifts in intensity or focus, giving the piece a somewhat static feel.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the contemplative, educated character. The point of view is held with discipline, and the elevated diction creates a distinct and memorable texture. The prose rhythm supports the story’s melancholic and hopeful tone, creating a cohesive and immersive narrative world from a singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes and maintains a distinct, lyrical voice with a clear perceptual signature focused on sound, resonance, and performance. The point of view is stable and controlled. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the elevated, ornate register is so consistent that it creates a monotonous texture, flattening the story's emotional dynamics rather than amplifying them.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lyrical voice is maintained consistently, but it is marred by prominent verbal tics. The verbatim repetition of unusual phrases like "olfactorily sensitive" and "tide's thought" reads as a mechanical artifact rather than a natural part of the character's perception. Additionally, the awkward verb "journalize" creates a jarring register clash with the otherwise poetic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent. The prose has a specific, somewhat formal and descriptive texture appropriate for a pilot on a mission. The piece lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate the voice from competent to memorable; the way Mira notices the world is more functional than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and the professional, measured voice is largely consistent. However, the voice occasionally slips into an authorial register to deliver thematic summaries, such as "Thus, she began to cultivate foresight in action." These moments compromise the character's internal voice, making it feel less like a specific perception and more like a narrator explaining the story's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for a fable-like narrative. The point of view is stable and controlled, filtering the world through the character's synesthetic perception. However, the prose rhythm becomes somewhat monotonous, with a uniform cadence across long, descriptive sentences that could benefit from more variation to match the story's internal dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece maintains a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice that suits its mythic subject matter. The point of view is expertly controlled, with a stable psychic distance that modulates appropriately with the rising tension of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is singular, controlled, and perfectly calibrated to the story's lyrical and intellectual aims.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control, creating a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the fable-like quality of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated lyrical tone that suits the fairytale-like premise. The point of view remains securely with Mara, and her perceptions shape the narrative. The prose has a clear poetic rhythm, but its register is somewhat static, lacking the modulation that could heighten the tension of the story’s central, sacrificial act.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct, lyrical voice that fits the fantastical setting. The narrator's perceptual signature is clear, focusing on rhythm, sound, and texture ("reverent rhythm," "crystal veins sang," "felt like wind caught in cotton"). The prose has a unique cadence that powerfully reflects the blacksmith's quiet, deliberate nature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, almost mythic tone that aligns with the story's conceptual nature. The point of view is stable, and the protagonist's perceptual signature as a "sensory map maker" is well-integrated. The prose, however, sometimes prioritizes poetic flourish over the immediate, stressed perceptions of a character in a tense situation, creating a slight narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, and the voice possesses a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture that perfectly matches the story's tone. The narrator’s perceptual signature is specific, focusing on details of light, stone, and sea that align with Marek’s character. The prose rhythmically shifts to match the contemplative pace of the ritual without any slips in control.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and establishes a distinct mytho-poetic tone from the first sentence. The close third-person POV remains tightly controlled on Mira, and her perceptions are filtered through the story's specific lexicon of light, shadow, and sea. The minimal dialogue feels appropriately ritualistic, functioning as incantation rather than conversation, which serves the narrative's aims perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and maintains a distinct tone of gentle wonder throughout. The third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose has a clear rhythmic quality. However, the psychic distance often feels too great, presenting Lira's experience through a descriptive filter rather than embodying her perception directly, which slightly mutes the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's melancholic and gentle tone. The narrative stance is confident, and Eli’s perceptual signature is clear, focused on the interplay of light, sorrow, and ancient mechanisms. The prose has a distinct texture, though it occasionally strays into overly familiar poetic phrasing ("groaning like old bones").

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is consistent and maintains a stable point of view, creating a cohesive, dreamlike atmosphere. However, the narrative voice lacks modulation; its rhythm and syntactic patterns are highly uniform throughout. This creates a monotonous texture where every moment is rendered with the same level of poetic intensity, slightly diminishing the impact of the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a lofty, lyrical tone. However, this voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more authorial than filtered through the specific consciousness of a "compassionate recluse." The prose is elegant but uniform, missing opportunities to modulate rhythm and diction to reflect the character's internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical voice and a stable point of view. The perceptual signature is distinct, focused on subtle details of decay and growth. While the prose texture is deliberate and controlled, the elevated, philosophical register feels slightly uniform and self-conscious, particularly in its repetition of key abstract phrases which can pull the reader out of the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is masterful, maintaining a consistent and distinct poetic texture that defines the story's world. The "quartz hush" is not just a description but the rhythmic and perceptual signature of the entire piece. POV is flawlessly controlled, with psychic distance perfectly calibrated to the chief’s meticulous and introspective state, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent lyrical texture. The main weakness is a recurring register mismatch where the prose feels more authorial and curated than authentic to the character's immediate experience under pressure. Phrases like "curiously steadfast" and "comforting unease" feel like external labels rather than an organic perceptual signature, creating a slight but persistent distance from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is highly distinct, consistent, and lyrical, establishing a strong "futuristic nostalgia" tone. The narrative perspective is tightly controlled, and Arin's perceptual signature—focused on taste, scent, and technological readings—is specific and well-maintained. The elevated prose is a confident stylistic choice that serves the story's specific aims without faltering.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is lyrical and consistent, establishing a distinct, melancholy tone. The third-person limited POV is maintained without error. The prose, however, sometimes creates a narrative distance that feels more authorial than character-bound; the elevated, poetic register doesn't always feel grounded in Lena's specific perceptual signature, especially during the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the fable-like quality of the narrative. The prose maintains a distinct, elevated texture that supports the story's atmosphere. The point of view is stable and controlled. The psychic distance is consistently maintained, though it remains somewhat remote, which keeps the reader at an observational distance from the character's immediate emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the material. However, it suffers from significant lexical repetition of key phrases ("muted vigor," "seasonally mute," "glisten"). This recurrence, while thematically reinforcing, creates a looping quality that flattens the voice's texture and dynamism over the course of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a consistent and distinct narrative voice for Vira. The prose effectively captures her unique perceptual signature as a nostalgic android, noticing details like "the faint scent of ozone and old metal." The lyrical, measured tone is sustained throughout, modulating appropriately without any slips in psychic distance or control.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. However, the voice occasionally slips from character-bound perception into authorial summary, particularly when stating Mara's motivation directly. The prose has a distinct rhythm, but it lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would distinguish Mara's way of seeing from a more generalized, descriptive narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent lyrical, almost mythic, tone. The point of view is stable, and the prose has a clear texture. However, the narrative distance is quite large; the voice often feels more like a poet-narrator describing Selene's symbolic journey than Selene's own internal experience. This stylistic choice is executed consistently but creates a barrier to deep character immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece maintains a consistent and lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, pressure, and scent. The narrative voice is controlled, modulating effectively from the quiet melancholy of the opening to the "gleaming silence" of the climax. The prose rhythm and texture are specific to Mara's worldview, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent throughout. The prose texture, with its specific vocabulary and deliberate rhythm, effectively establishes the story's solemn, magical tone. This control creates a strong perceptual signature for the character and the world she inhabits.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and sustained, establishing a lyrical and observant tone from the first sentence. The prose possesses a clear perceptual signature, filtering the magical events through a specific, scholarly-yet-yearning lens. Point of view remains consistent and controlled, expertly modulating psychic distance to match the rising intimacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lyrical voice is consistent, but its reliance on abstract, academic-sounding jargon ("resonance structures," "quarantined memory," "symbolic alchemy") creates a significant distance from Lira's experience. This diction feels more like the author's conceptual framework than the character's internal voice, resulting in a narrative that tells us about a feeling rather than embodying it. The prose has a distinct texture, but it obscures rather than reveals the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the story's mythic quality. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Liora's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical, and elevated tone that is well-suited to the mythic quality of the story. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on the singer's perceptions. However, the narrative voice is so uniformly poetic that it occasionally lacks a specific, idiosyncratic perceptual signature, reading more as a generalized mythic narrator than a unique individual's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice that is well-suited to its mythic subject matter. Point of view is stable and controlled. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for a philosophical meditation. The point of view is controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature is clear, focusing on patterns, light, and texture. The prose achieves a specific rhythm, though its uniformity prevents modulation that could heighten the emotional impact of the philosopher's deepening insight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice is more functional than distinctive, lacking a unique perceptual signature. Interiority often explains Mira's conclusions rather than dramatizing her thought process, as seen in the line, "Mira smiled, realizing the hidden stillpoint was not a place but a mental state..." which reports the epiphany instead of embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is singular, confident, and sustained with impressive consistency, perfectly capturing the "gritty whimsy" tone. The highly lyrical, almost mythic prose is a deliberate and effective choice that establishes a distinct perceptual signature for the narrative. Point of view remains tightly controlled within the visionary's experience, and the psychic distance is expertly managed to suit the story's grand, fable-like scale.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct, sustained, and highly lyrical, with a perceptual signature fitting the "penny poet." The point of view remains consistently and effectively controlled. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the elevated, figurative register is maintained so relentlessly that it can feel performative and lacks the dynamic range that would heighten moments of peak emotional intensity through contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is controlled and consistent, and the narrative voice is distinct in its elevated, lyrical tone. The prose effectively establishes a specific mood. The main limitation is that the voice feels more authorial than character-specific; its ornate texture doesn't always align with the "logically emotional" mind of an engineer, reading as a stylistic layer rather than an organic expression of her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that fits the story's meditative quality. Elara's perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through the eyes of a "horizon mapper" focused on patterns and subtle shifts. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, though it maintains a single poetic register with little modulation even at the story's peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical and measured tone that reflects the protagonist's "watchfully calm" demeanor. The POV remains tightly focused, and the narrator’s perceptual signature is clear. However, the prose occasionally drifts into a register that feels more literary than authentic to an investigator in the field, with vocabulary and phrasing that can seem overwrought rather than emerging organically from the character's mindset under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice feels more authorial and lyrical than rooted in the chaplain's specific perceptual signature. The prose is marked by repetitive, almost incantatory phrases ("vibrant hush," "By the way light breaks through storm clouds") that create a patterned texture but also feel like a stylistic tic rather than an organic expression of the character's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    The voice is the story's greatest strength: a highly distinct, consistent, and confident blend of whimsical surrealism and mechanical specificity. The POV is flawlessly controlled, filtering every perception through Mara’s "mischievous wonder." Phrases like "sarcastic philosophers debating the meaning of motion" create a unique perceptual signature that is controlled even as the tone shifts to "absurdly jubilant" at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a voice that is both professional and lyrical. Lia's perceptual signature, her "brightly attentive" nature, shapes what the reader notices. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture that supports the story's contemplative yet investigative tone without any slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining an elevated, poetic tone that fits the story's mythic quality. Point of view is stable and focalization is controlled. However, the voice occasionally drifts into a slightly abstract, academic register ("reconstitute lost wholeness via glimpses") that feels less embodied than the surrounding prose, creating minor textural inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and maintains a distinct perceptual signature focused on cold, light, and sound. The prose has a deliberate, melancholic rhythm that fits the tone. The only weakness is that the voice's high level of poetic articulation can feel slightly at odds with the character's internal crisis, creating a small distance between the character's experience and the narration of it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is compromised by mechanical repetition and a detached, academic register. The recurrence of identical phrases ("drawing parallels," "gently persuasive," "passionate subtlety") creates an artificial, algorithmic feel that distances the reader. This prevents the emergence of a truly distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance from the Keeper that supports the story's calm, observant tone. The voice is distinct, with a lyrical and rhythmic quality that is sustained from start to finish. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical world through the Keeper's specific, focused consciousness without any slips or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is lyrical, distinctive, and maintains a consistent tone of "earnest whimsy" that suits the story's fable-like quality. The third-person POV remains tightly controlled on Mara. While the prose is elegant, the single line of dialogue attributed to Mara at the end feels slightly stiff and less organic than the surrounding narration, reading more like an authorial pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical quality appropriate for the subject matter. However, the prose occasionally drifts into a register that feels more ornate than authentic to the moment, with phrases like "sonically reflective shards of light" and "testify through the crystal." This slightly overwrought diction, while ambitious, can create a distance from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, establishing a powerful perceptual signature where the world is filtered through metaphors of sound, decay, and water. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on the prophet’s internal experience. The prose rhythm effectively mirrors the story’s "slow, rolling breaths," though the sheer density of figurative language occasionally feels more authorial than purely character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is masterful, maintaining a consistent, elevated, and lyrical tone that perfectly suits the material. The third-person POV is controlled with a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on vibration, light, and rhythm in a way that is specific to the sage. The prose rhythm and sentence structure modulate effectively to build a sense of awe and quiet intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.5)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. However, the voice feels generic rather than character-specific, reading more like an author's "literary" register than the distinct internal world of this particular therapist. It maintains its mood but at the cost of unique character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story maintains a stable and controlled third-person limited POV. The voice has a consistent, elevated, and lyrical texture appropriate for the genre. While the prose is confident, the perceptual signature, though fitting for a scholar, does not achieve a truly unique or unforgettable quality that would mark it as exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the story's mythic quality. The POV is controlled and stable. However, the narrative voice is hampered by a reliance on a small cluster of keywords ("constellations," "cleft," "skeptic," "shrewdly innocent"), which are repeated to the point of becoming a tic. This repetition, while perhaps intentional, gives the voice a slightly mechanical feel, as if executing a formula rather than flowing organically.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. The prose maintains a controlled and purposeful rhythm that suits the meditative atmosphere. While technically proficient, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; it reads as a generic "literary" voice rather than one uniquely filtered through the specific experiences and biases of the "earthbound star watcher," slightly flattening the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that suits the story's gentle, meditative quality. The point of view is controlled and effective. However, the recurring use of specific, unusual phrases like "honeyed hush" (seven times) feels mechanical and inorganic, as if fulfilling a prompt rather than flowing from the character's unique perceptual signature. This repetition creates a slightly artificial texture.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes and maintains a distinct, lyrical voice with a consistent psychic distance. The POV is controlled, and the narrator’s perceptual signature is strong. However, the narrative voice is so uniformly elevated and poetic that it lacks dynamic modulation; the tone remains at the same high pitch from start to finish, which slightly flattens the emotional arc and creates a sense of aesthetic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct, lyrical voice. The narrative has a clear perceptual signature, focusing on sensory details that support the magical, reverent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is distinct, with a strong and consistent poetic register that defines the story's reality. The alchemist's perceptual signature, viewing the world through a lens of magical potential, is expertly maintained. However, the voice is somewhat monolithic; its rhythm and intensity rarely modulate, which lends a slightly breathless, overwrought quality to the prose throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly sustained, creating a contemplative, almost mythic tone that aligns with the story's concept. The third-person limited POV remains tightly controlled, and Corin's "reflective" nature shapes a strong perceptual signature in every description. The prose rhythm and elevated diction are consistent and serve the story's aims without deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is masterful, establishing a consistent and hypnotic lyrical tone from the first sentence. The POV is flawlessly maintained, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, sound, and resonant textures ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie"). Syntax and rhythm are controlled and modulated to match the dreamlike, ritualistic pace, creating a prose texture that is both unique and deeply immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature focused on texture, light, and memory. The POV remains tightly controlled, and the prose rhythm successfully modulates with the character's internal state. While generally strong, the elevated, metaphor-rich register occasionally feels more authorial than character-driven, slightly distancing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story possesses a distinct and consistent lyrical voice, with a controlled psychic distance that suits the melancholic, reflective mood. The POV is stable and the perceptual signature is strong, filtering the fantastical setting through Mara’s specific sense of loss. The prose, while beautiful, occasionally feels so uniformly elevated that it risks distancing the reader from the character's immediate sensory experience, reading more as a highly polished narration than a direct channel to her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is consistent, but the voice feels more authorial than character-driven, relying on an elevated, poetic register that can feel detached from the supposed mindset of a "functionally creative" engineer. The prose is stylistically consistent, but the perceptual signature is generic in its abstraction ("weight of a distant star," "maze of intentions") rather than showing a unique, professional way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is consistent, with a distinct lyrical voice and a strong perceptual signature focused on sound, silence, and texture. The prose has a deliberate rhythm that fits the character. The score is lowered by authorial tics that contaminate the voice, chiefly the repetitive use of "excruciatingly gentle," which feels imposed rather than arising naturally from the character's mind and dilutes its own meaning through overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative voice becomes monotonous due to the constant recycling of the same key phrases ("architecture of lies," "serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity"). This lexical repetition creates an artificial, programmatic texture that undermines the intended lyrical quality. The voice feels more like an instrument for delivering theme than the authentic perception of a character.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature. The voice is lyrical, measured, and perfectly matched to the story's philosophical and atmospheric aims ("his coat a muted echo of distant tides"). There are no slips in focalization, and the prose's rhythm and texture directly reflect the protagonist's patient, observant mind.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes and maintains a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice. The third-person limited POV maintains a steady psychic distance that suits the mythic quality of the narrative. However, the voice occasionally feels more authorial and ornate than grounded in the specific, moment-to-moment perceptions of the traveler, blending into the prose's overall density.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The prince's perceptual signature, which filters the world through a lens of "gear than garden," is distinct and effective. The score is slightly capped because the voice loses some of its character-specific texture in the final paragraphs, shifting toward a more omniscient, moralizing narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is stable and the perceptual signature is clear, focused on sensory details relevant to Mira's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is highly distinct, controlled, and poetic, creating a consistent and immersive atmosphere that perfectly matches the protagonist’s meditative nature. The prose has a clear perceptual signature. The score is held back slightly only by the voice's uniform, elevated register, which lacks modulation even as events unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The elevated, lyrical voice is consistently maintained and fits the solemn, mythical tone. However, the point of view lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond this formal register, often describing Mara's state with abstract concepts ("conduit of redemption") rather than grounding it in her unique perspective. The voice serves the atmosphere well but feels more like an omniscient narrator's commentary than a character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a powerful and controlled tone. The POV is stable and effective. The only minor friction is a slight mismatch between the highly elevated, poetic register of the narration and the humble persona of a "cemetery gardener," which can occasionally make the voice feel more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.7)
    The point of view is stable and the elevated, mythic voice is consistently maintained. However, the narrative distance often feels too great, presenting events in summary rather than through an immediate, character-specific perceptual filter. The voice has a distinct texture but lacks a unique signature that would separate this specific cartographer's mind from a generic wise narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a memorable, dreamlike mood. The point of view remains tightly controlled on Mara, with a clear perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent "abrasive calm," fitting the philosopher persona. The prose has a specific intellectual texture, and the point of view is controlled and stable. The primary weakness is a slight lack of modulation; the voice remains highly articulate and analytical even during the moment of revelation, which makes it feel a bit static and less reflective of a mind undergoing a significant shift.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice is lyrical and controlled. The narrative distance is stable, creating a somewhat formal, observational tone that fits the character's demeanor. The prose has a distinct texture, though at times it feels more authorial than character-specific, a stylistic choice that serves the fable-like quality of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The prose is controlled, creating a distinct atmosphere. The voice, however, feels more like a polished narrative register than a deeply idiosyncratic perspective rooted in this specific character; it's the voice of the story, not uniquely the voice of Mara. It is highly effective but lacks that final degree of character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is consistent and the voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone appropriate for a modern fable. However, the narrative voice sometimes detaches from Mara's immediate perception to offer thematic explanations, creating a slight psychic distance that dulls the story's immediacy. The prose has a distinct rhythm, but it occasionally relies on familiar poetic phrasing ("wound on the city's heart") rather than a truly unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is highly distinct, consistent, and controlled, establishing a specific poetic and contemplative narrative stance from the first sentence. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering all details through the protagonist's unique worldview. The voice is perhaps too uniformly stylized, lacking modulation under pressure, which keeps it from feeling fully embodied, but its technical execution is very solid.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The elevated, lyrical voice is consistently maintained and fits the ancient, serene perspective of the statue. However, the prose lacks sufficient rhythmic and syntactic variety, resulting in a somewhat monotonous cadence that doesn't modulate enough to reflect the rising intensity of the "revelations."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece maintains a consistent and elevated authorial voice that suits its philosophical subject matter. The narrative distance is controlled, and the prose has a distinct, poetic texture.

    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and consistently maintained, creating a dreamlike, melancholic atmosphere that perfectly suits the story. The third-person limited POV is well-controlled, and the perceptual signature—focused on light, shadow, and ancient whispers—is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice establishes a distinct, gothic texture. The prose is stylized and ambitious, effectively creating its intended mood.

    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and largely consistent, creating a mythic, elevated tone. The POV is skillfully controlled, maintaining a close third-person perspective that aligns with the story's aims. The primary weakness is a slight drift into a more academic or conceptual register with phrases like "fractal generating patterns," which can feel imposed on the mystical voice rather than emerging organically from the prophet's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative voice is the story's great strength, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and mythic tone that perfectly suits the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice—formal, measured, slightly academic—is appropriate for a historian. The prose maintains a stable tone and distance. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the voice feels more like a generic literary narrator than the specific internal world of Arlen. It describes his "emotionally rational" state but doesn't fully embody it in its rhythm or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, perfectly matching the melancholic, reverent tone. Point of view remains tightly focused on Mara, and her perceptions are shaped by her unique sensibility as a surveyor of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.0)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with Mara's methodical character. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond its calmness. The repetitive use of signature phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") feels more like an authorial tic than an authentic reflection of the character's mind, creating a sense of artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a well-controlled psychic distance that enhances the mythical, contemplative tone. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on light, glass, steam, and shadow, which aligns perfectly with the character's craft and internal state. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, moving from quiet setup to the humming intensity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, melancholic register, and the point of view is tightly controlled. However, the prose is so uniformly dense with figurative language that it sometimes obscures a distinct, character-particular perceptual signature. The voice reads more as a high-level authorial style than the specific, stressed internal monologue of a grieving survivor.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is monotonous and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Lira is a "sharp-eyed drone pilot," yet her perspective is rendered in the same elevated, abstract prose as the narration, showing no trace of a technician's mindset. The voice is consistent in its lyrical register but fails to create a specific, believable character consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and maintains a controlled, melancholic tone that suits the story. The prose has a deliberate, rhythmic quality, and the POV remains firmly anchored. However, the register is uniformly elevated, even in moments of high emotional pressure, which can make the voice feel more writerly than authentic to a character in crisis, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the narrative voice has a distinct, somber texture. However, the elevated, lyrical register sometimes feels more authorial than character-bound, creating a distance from the protagonist's immediate experience. The prose signature is strong but uniform, lacking modulation that would reflect a more granular internal state under pressure; the "furrowed hush" feels imposed rather than arising from a specific mind.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, melancholic register. However, the prose's high polish and elaborate metaphorical structure create a distance from the "broken" character, at times feeling more like an author's elegant narration than the navigator's own perceptual signature. While controlled, this slight mismatch between the voice and the character's raw emotional state tempers the story's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent tone of "jaded wonder," effectively filtering the fantastical setting through the protagonist's perspective. The POV is stable and the narrative distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is highly distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating an effective narrative filter that defines the story's world.

    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent from the first sentence, creating a distinct and appropriate mythic tone. The close third-person POV remains stable, filtering all perception through Nara's solemn perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that aligns with the story's mythic quality. POV is stable and controlled. The primary weakness is that the voice feels slightly more authorial than character-bound; its poetic register sometimes distances the reader from Mara's specific, moment-to-moment experience, reading like a fable's narrator rather than a destitute philanthropist's internal world.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is distinct and highly stylized, but it verges on overpowering the narrative. The prose has a consistent, lyrical texture, yet phrases like "winking hush" are repeated, feeling more like an authorial tic than a natural element of the POV. This stylistic uniformity creates a strong mood but keeps the reader at an aesthetic distance from Kael’s immediate experience.

    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a distinct, elevated, and lyrical tone. The prose has a deliberate rhythm that suits the solemn, ritualistic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice maintains a consistent, elevated, and mythic tone that suits the material. The prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature. However, the narrative distance wavers, particularly in the final third, where the voice slips from dramatization into authorial summary, explaining the story's legend and impact rather than allowing the reader to infer it from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice, filtering all perception through a poetic, elevated lens that suits the material. The third-person limited POV is controlled, with a stable psychic distance.

    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, measured, and lyrical tone that aligns with the slow-spoken protagonist. The point of view is stable, and the perceptual signature is clear. However, the voice lacks modulation; its rhythm and elevated register remain largely unchanged even as the magical ritual reaches its peak, creating a somewhat monolithic texture that misses an opportunity to reflect the rising tension through prose rhythm.
