    Voice maintains consistent scientific precision filtered through Elena's POV ("preprocessing reality," "intricate models"), with perceptual signature evident in how she notices patterns and fractals. Some register drift occurs in emotional peaks ("unfamiliar tug," "gentle flame eroding her detachment") that doesn't fully match the established clinical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled imagery ("stars wheeled overhead like distant lanterns") though occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("drifting resonance," "fractured thoughts"). The POV holds steady through Elara's perception. Some passages edge toward explanatory ("she knew she must retrace") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated prose appropriate to the fantastical premise ("a vast dome of frost-etched panes that trapped winter's breath"). The POV remains stable in close third, with Elara's musician's perspective coloring observations. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("vines that twisted like frozen melodies"), but rhythm generally supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphors ("bent like a drowned willow," "echoes in a cavern").

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the piece's mythic tone ("gently persistent resolve that whispered through every decision"). Perceptual signature shows in selective details like "terra-cotta arbor...like a sentinel." However, dialogue is absent when the declaration scene would benefit from varied voices, and some phrases edge toward purple prose ("tapestry that could outlast any embargo").

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The mystical register maintains consistency with phrases like "pilgrim of sparks" and "foggy lucidity," creating a distinct texture. However, the prose relies heavily on abstract declarations ("unused love flooded out") rather than concrete perception, and the breathing sequence lacks embodied detail of how the technique actually works.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction matching the fantastical setting ("celestial echoes," "hyperbolic fractals"). POV remains stable in close third. Some filter verb clusters ("he saw," "he felt," "he realized") reduce immediacy during peak stress, and occasional purple prose ("shadows quivered like forgotten dreams") strains without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains literary elevation with phrases like "staggering grace" and "shadows seeking light," fitting the story's tone. POV stays consistently with Elias, filtering perception through his strategic mind. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("husk of abandoned carnival," "forgotten dreams"), but rhythm generally supports tension.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature through synesthesia ("heard colors faintly—a synesthetic gift that turned the crimson of ripening fruit into a soft hum") maintains consistency. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from lyrical description to tighter focus during the forging sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's "quietly savvy" nature, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("forest under siege by twilight"). POV remains stable and the perceptual signature focuses appropriately on light and coded meanings. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("luminous disbelief" appears three times).

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's theatrical narration ("Behold, the grains of time surrender to fire's embrace!") creates a distinct voice that modulates between performative grandiosity and quiet vulnerability ("She would have loved this"). The perceptual signature of transforming mundane acts into epic saga effectively characterizes his "thoughtfully spirited" nature.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture, relying on generic literary phrases like "shattered his identity like glass underfoot" without character-specific perception. POV control wavers when narrating Mara's deeper schemes with unwarranted certainty. The prose attempts elevated diction that occasionally clashes with the stunt double protagonist's presumed register, though no dialogue appears to establish voice contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic distance with controlled, elevated diction appropriate to the oracle figure. Perceptual signature shows in how she reads silence as substance ("ambered voids," "golden pathways").

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with distinct perceptual signature: Eko processes through mechanical metaphors ("mechanical precision," "sensors registering") that evolve toward organic understanding. Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to mystical experience during the violin sequence. Some register elevation during peak moments ("cosmos," "enlightenment") slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled rhythm ("where droplets clung to shimmering facets like unspoken regrets"). The perceptual signature stays rooted in Elias's mistrust filtering everything through suspicion. Some register drift occurs ("freed by honesty, Elias felt the ice within him melt") that feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "shuffled along paths he had carved decades ago" establishing Elias's worn persistence. The perceptual signature focuses on tactile garden details and transformation metaphors. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("commemorating small victories elaborately") that doesn't fully match Elias's pragmatic character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("temporal streams," "magnetic fluxes") appropriate to Elara's POV. Dialogue feels natural with character-specific registers—Jax's casual "Count me in" versus Elara's formal explanations. Some filter phrases ("Elara felt," "she believed") dull immediacy, and the narrative occasionally drifts into explanatory mode rather than maintaining scenic presence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct voice with musical metaphors woven throughout ("whispers from strings," "suspended breath before the conductor's downbeat") that feel organic to a cellist's POV. The "wordless" conceit is maintained consistently with no dialogue, letting action and image carry meaning. Some register elevation in peak moments ("architecture of sound," "drowned dreams") slightly strains the established voice, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("Elias's breath caught").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency through elevated diction ("auroral sorrow," "fleeting beauty") appropriate to literary fiction. However, Thorne's dialogue ("You seek the measure of what you've hidden") reads stilted rather than natural. The POV occasionally slips into omniscient territory with phrases like "enigmatic figure known only as Thorne."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "reckless nature pulling him forward like an unyielding current" and selective perception fitting an urban explorer. The prose effectively modulates between drowsy observation and alert tension. Some passages drift into overwriting ("spectral workers toiling eternally in abandoned sites, reenacting their grueling labors as if death were just another overtime") without clear POV justification.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through phrases like "eyes like faded ink" and selective attention to decay and transformation. Voice maintains consistency through elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to an ageless observer. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("regenerative silence worked its magic") that edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency and the free indirect style ("wonder had fled him like shadows at noon") shows control. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's therapist perspective doesn't meaningfully filter what she notices, and her internal voice could belong to any gentle healer figure without specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent erudition matching Elias's historian perspective, with selective perception focused on textures and histories. Phrases like "bronze quiet" and "yellowed like autumn leaves" create distinctive atmosphere. Some passages drift into elevated register ("perpetual wakefulness under a sky that no longer inspired slumber") that occasionally obscures rather than enriches.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with musical metaphors ("transpose," "orchestrated harmony," "conductor's baton") that reinforce theme. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. The fortune examples ("The wave you ride hides the undertow you know") demonstrate character-specific cryptic style. Slight repetition in metaphor patterns doesn't significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains mystical-liturgical register consistently ("veils of quiet," "abyssal waters"). The loop-pedal conceit generates distinctive rhythm through repetition and layering. Perceptual signature shows in how Elias experiences the chapel's "muffled clarity," though some phrases edge toward purple ("insidious grip," "malevolent force").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in phrases like "upturned hush" and "silence not oppressive but lifting," though occasional elevation ("ethereal notes that only he could hear") slightly strains the established tone. The perceptual signature of temporal sensitivity shapes unique observations like the "mirrored horizon, where the heavens and earth blended seamlessly, doubling the stars in an infinite loop."

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    The elevated register suits the mythic scope, with consistent POV control and no head-hopping. Phrases like "periodically eternal" and "procedural generation" create distinctive texture. However, the voice occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("labyrinth of self coiling tighter with isolation's thorns") that distances us from embodied experience during peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "faint rustle of turning seasons" and "filament of hush," creating a hushed texture that mirrors content. Some register elevation ("liminal time," "enthralling") slightly strains the intimate POV, and syntactic patterns occasionally repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices storms, patterns, and atmospheric details with professional precision. Free indirect style flows cleanly ("Who would send a bird in these times..."). The narrative voice modulates effectively from contemplative observation to urgent questioning, though some passages lean toward elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent melancholic register with controlled rhythm that mirrors Elias's caution ("measured steps," "trembling hand"). Perceptual signature shows selective attention to scent and light. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("whirlpools of memory that left him adrift"), but generally supports the elegiac tone.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains poetic register appropriate to a "drifting roadside poet" with phrases like "fractured highways" and "sedimentary beds." However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond Elias's established lexicon ("terra-cotta," "residual energy"), and no dialogue tests character distinction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm that matches the contemplative tone. Perceptual signature shows in acoustic details others miss - "faintest whispers of wind through rusted hulls." Some elevated diction ("ethereal notes spilled out") occasionally strains against the established register but doesn't break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains an elevated, almost ceremonial register appropriate to the ritual context, with phrases like "affectionate detachment" and "professionally thorough" establishing Elara's controlled perspective. The prose modulates effectively during the transformation sequence, though occasional overwriting ("sparks dancing like fireflies in the dim light") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency with access to Elias's thoughts and observations. Voice shows some distinction in descriptive passages ("bookshelves stood like sentinels") though dialogue lacks differentiation between characters. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("whimsically attentive nature") that doesn't fully align with a cargo broker's likely lexicon, creating minor register inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "crystalline orchard" and "luminescent ache," but this elevated diction creates distance rather than intimacy. No dialogue appears despite multiple characters present, missing opportunities for voice distinction and subtext during the communal search.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with selective perception like Elara sketching "delicate veins of floating lily pads." However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("labyrinthine city perched atop") that occasionally obscures immediacy, and dialogue is absent where it might have grounded character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("secretive conjurer," "tiny architect sculpting the stone"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance for this reflective mode. Some elevated diction ("dovetail," "incantations") fits the conjurer's perspective without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent ethereal register ("sapphire hush," "ethereal veils") that matches Elias's liminal existence, though occasionally tips into overwriting. POV remains stable in close third. The narrative voice effectively modulates between present action and sense memory without confusion, though some constructions feel writerly rather than lived ("the tone of the morning was a sapphire hush").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with botanical specificity fitting Elara's expertise. Her indirect communication style appears in moments like explaining "hesitations in life" through "stories of wilting ferns." However, some passages drift into elevated register ("tempests battered the landscape, revealing secrets") that doesn't fully match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains a literary register appropriate to the post-apocalyptic setting ("parched throats," "haggard awe"). Some effective compression: "water wars had taken his family." However, Mira's dialogue lacks distinction from Elias's voice, and phrases like "wryly earnest smile" feel prompt-driven rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice maintains mystical register appropriate to fantasy ("robes whispering," "ethereal glows") with consistent third-person limited POV. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fluid awareness of possibilities") and relies on filter constructions ("she felt," "she gasped"). The perceptual signature lacks specificity—how does a clairvoyant uniquely notice versus any pilgrim?

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a literary register appropriate to the mythic tone ("pale spires of weathered bone rose like forgotten teeth"). The POV remains stable in third-limited focused on Elara. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels writerly rather than character-filtered ("the earthy scent mingling with brine"), and no dialogue appears to test voice distinction or naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled mystical register and consistent POV. The "analytically artistic" perspective colors perception throughout ("symphonies of lines and curves"). Some repetitive phrasing ("trembling certainty" appears three times, "analytically artistic" four times) creates unwanted echo effects.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("perched high above the crashing waves where the ocean met the cliffs"). The perceptual signature—Elara noticing celestial alignments, mathematical patterns, whale movements—reflects her character. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Minor weakness: occasional drift toward elevated diction ("sculpt space for reflection") that slightly exceeds the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, atmospheric diction appropriate to an immortal's perspective ("threadbare tapestry," "prismatic shards converged"). The prose successfully modulates during the breach sequence, intensifying rhythm. However, some passages drift into purple prose ("fractured light and shadowed crystals deep within the Earth's forgotten veins") that prioritizes atmosphere over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent close third-person POV with distinct voice combining technical precision ("algorithm," "encrypted files") with emotional complexity. Some register drift into elevated diction ("deathly vitality," "cosmetic revival") that doesn't fully match Alex's practical mindset. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the protagonist's scholarly nature, with phrases like "blooming labyrinth," "gilded-leaf stationer," and "prismatic whispers" creating distinctive texture. The perceptual signature focuses on textures, light refraction, and subtle sounds. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("incandescent restraint") but generally serve the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture beyond its conceptual frame. Phrases like "filtered reality differently" and "texture of memories" repeat without variation. The POV's perceptual signature—seeing "colors bled into sounds"—is stated rather than demonstrated through specific sensory selection.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent erudite tone with phrases like "gloomy cheerfulness" and "resonant hums." The reimagined conversations between past astronomers show creative POV work, though some constructions feel overwrought ("the observatory's decay...hummed with an odd, inviting melancholy").

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited perspective but lacks distinctive texture. Lanara's "orderly intuitive" nature doesn't shape the narrative syntax or rhythm. The voice remains competent but generic—phrases like "hope flickered in her chest" and "desperation clawed at her" could appear in any story without modification.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture. POV remains stable with appropriate access to Elena's thoughts. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("poignant sorrow for the irreplaceable") that doesn't match the technical inspector character, and perceptual signature could be more selective.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent POV and creates a distinct atmosphere through phrases like "salty whispers" and "magnetic calm," but suffers from overwriting ("heartfelt artisan," "mist-coated rail depot") and repetitive constructions. Dialogue feels functional rather than revealing character through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with dry wit threading through narration ("Because nothing says 'trust me' like a foreigner mangling your sacred language"). The cartographer's selective perception shapes what's noticed. Some filter verb accumulation ("Elias felt," "he sought") dulls immediacy in places, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture; phrases like "wild hush" repeat without variation, creating monotony. POV remains distant and observational rather than intimate, missing opportunities for Thorne's cryptic perspective to color perception.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with effective modulation between technical description and lyrical moments ("silences amassed like treasures in a vault"). Some elevated diction ("abyssal depths," "lonesome splendor") fits the mythic tone, though phrases like "poignant calm" and "arcane means" occasionally drift toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("chased hush," "thread a labyrinth"). The perceptual signature shows Elias noticing details through his lens of seeking truth and silence. Some phrases feel overwrought ("where prisoners once chased hush in isolation"), and the shift to more direct narration in the ghost encounter section briefly disrupts the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains gothic atmosphere with controlled diction ("ephemeral cameo," "lovingly venomous"), though some passages drift into elevated register beyond POV plausibility ("karmic imbalance that kept her tethered"). Perceptual signature weakens during peak moments with generic phrasing like "heart ached."

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyrical voice creates consistent atmosphere with phrases like "orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic," maintaining a dreamlike register appropriate to the sleepwalking conceit. However, POV modesty fails when the narrator describes unconscious actions Elara cannot know ("Unbeknownst to her waking self"). No dialogue appears to test character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled diction appropriate to literary fantasy, but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices what any returnee might notice. Prose modulates slightly with discovery moments but doesn't reflect stress or internal texture changes. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative stance remains stable but generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some atmospheric texture. However, Elara's perceptual signature lacks distinction—her observations could belong to any character. Lines like "memories flooded her" and "she felt a surge of purpose" rely on emotional summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction matching the fantastical setting, and the perceptual signature of noticing cosmic patterns is distinct. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overly ornate constructions ("autumn-kissed," "gossiping comets") that blur immediacy. No dialogue appears, limiting character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical texture ("roots arched like forgotten promises") and controlled rhythm. Some register elevation feels forced ("fierce tenderness" appears four times). The perceptual signature of seeing "veils between worlds" is consistent but occasionally tips into purple prose ("silver beams dancing on brackish water").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with Elena's translator perspective filtering observations like "shrewdly innocent eyes." The dialogue in native dialect feels natural. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elena felt it keenly") and occasional register elevation ("labyrinthine grooves") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains dreamy, artistic register consistently ("spectral groves," "luminous tapestry") with controlled rhythm that breathes with the pensive mirth tone. POV remains stable in close third with appropriate uncertainty markers ("as if," "seemed to"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("insistent, like a whisper from antiquity") but generally serves the reverie mode.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains dreamy precision appropriate to the lyric mode, with phrases like "echoes bloomed like iridescent flowers" establishing texture early. POV remains stable through Elara's perception even across reality layers. Dialogue serves its minimal but crucial function, with the visitor's question and Elara's response framing the entire nested journey effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains a literary register with controlled diction ("candidly cryptic," "convergence") that fits Elias's scholar identity. Dialogue carries subtext ("the stars align in riddles, but we dance the puzzle") and advances plot. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("forbidden whispers," "neural pathways") without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "veined with iridescent nacre" and "underwater flowers," creating a dreamlike register appropriate to the mythic scope.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled, elevated diction appropriate to the ethereal setting. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elara notices fragility, translucence, and echoes. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("poisonous beauty that laced her every action") but generally serve the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive academic-mystical diction ("arcane linguist," "latent power," "cautious exuberance") that suits Elara's scholarly perspective. The narrative voice modulates effectively during the ritual sequence, though Thorne's minimal dialogue prevents full voice distinction testing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong narrative control with consistent close third-person POV and appropriate diction for an ingenious machinist. The prose modulates effectively between technical observation and emotional register. Minor weakness in occasional purple patches ("whispers of resolved dualities") that drift from Elias's pragmatic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to Elias's introspective nature. Phrases like "blooming, withering cycle of trust itself" show controlled rhythm. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("labyrinth of bookshelves," "tentative bloom"). No dialogue prevents full assessment of voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent lyrical voice with controlled rhythm, though it tends toward elevated register that occasionally strains ("featherly determined spirit—light as down"). No dialogue to evaluate. The contemplative distance suits the reflective mode but prevents immediacy during what should be discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with "shadowseam wonder" texture throughout. POV stays controlled with Elara's selective perception of bioluminescence and ruins. Some elevated diction ("entombed beneath layers of ocean and time") occasionally drifts from character register, and filter verbs accumulate in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions and appropriate vocabulary for the fantastical setting, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically rather than through a specific character lens. The prose tends toward purple in places ("silver-winged wanderer," "pollen-dusted memories") without earning the elevation through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with controlled, literary diction ("calculated wilderness," "orchestrated serendipity"). However, focalization occasionally slips—we're told what Mira thinks ("What serendipity, she thought") despite third-person limited POV on Elias. The prose rhythm doesn't modulate sufficiently under pressure; emotional peaks maintain the same measured cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm that modulates during the ritual ("She spun, eyes fixed on the heavens"). POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature in how Elara notices tidal patterns even in landlocked exile. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("obsidian-graced," "iridescent core") but serves the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent reflective tone with moments of genuine texture ("where the sea whispered secrets to the shore"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization through Elias. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("noctilucent reckonings," "spectral") that feels imposed rather than emerging from a glazier's lexicon, and some constructions feel writerly rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical language ("granite wrapped in moss") though it occasionally drifts into overwriting. Eli's dialogue feels rehearsed rather than natural—"This was my innocence...I bargained it away"—lacking the hesitation or searching quality of genuine revelation. The narration's elevated diction sometimes exceeds what feels natural for tracking a firefighter's consciousness, particularly in phrases like "celestial ballet."

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature focuses on patterns and measurements fitting her logical dreamer nature. However, the voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—the same measured tone persists whether describing calm arrangement or timeline upheaval.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception ("sensitively perceptive, attuned to the faintest vibrations") and profession-specific focus on echoes and resonances. Some elevated diction ("verdant shroud," "singed envelope") fits the literary tone, though phrases like "heartquickened" and occasional filter verbs ("she noticed," "she felt") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm: "ghostly children playing, lovers reuniting, futures unfolding in vibrant hues." The perceptual signature focuses on light, refraction, and ephemeral imagery appropriate to the painter's nature. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("blooming hush," "echoing terrace") but serve the ethereal atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, formal diction appropriate to epic fantasy. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices celestial movements and ancient details. However, the prose lacks distinct texture—sentences follow similar patterns, and the narrative voice feels generic rather than character-specific, missing opportunities for voice modulation under the pressure of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled elevated diction matching Elias's worldview ("manufactured drought," "corporate sleight-of-hand"). Some register drift into overly poetic territory ("poem interrupted," "fractured grace") that doesn't fully align with the businessman's lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy setting, with moments of genuine beauty ("moonlight fractured into a thousand silent shards"). However, abstract phrasing dominates critical moments ("bodily poetic grace," "ethereal fireflies"), creating distance rather than immediacy. The POV remains stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond the poetic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains elegant, literary consistency with phrases like "meteor hush" and "fractured patterns," though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geodesic panels," "ethical explorations") that feels slightly removed from embodied experience. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is distinct in noticing ink stains and shadow patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's esoteric worldview with strong perceptual signature ("mist clung like whispered secrets"). Some phrases like "tapestry of hidden truths" and "spectral narratives" edge toward purple prose but rhythm control during the construction sequence shows mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with strong rhythmic control in passages like "aurora's ethereal glow." Some register drift occurs with phrases like "snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" that feel workshopped rather than organic to the POV's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"vines choked the remnants of human folly," "thunder grumbled on the horizon." The perceptual signature of seeing through metaphor (roots seeking water, dying stars) fits her interpretive gift, though some passages drift toward elevated diction that strains the POV's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV focused on Elias, with some evocative phrasing like "shadows of uncertainty to dance in peaceful twilight." However, register drift appears in abstract passages ("empirically ironic," "harmonious limbo") that feel more authorial than character-filtered. No dialogue appears to evaluate, and the perceptual signature remains generic rather than distinctly Elias's scientific-mystical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("In the soundless sanctuary, where echoes dared not linger"). POV remains stable in close third focused on Elara with brief necessary shifts to show Thorne's interior during transformation. Perceptual signature shows Elara reading bodies and planning interventions. Some elevated diction ("anathema," "festered") fits the mythic tone but occasionally feels overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elias's craft and vision, with controlled rhythm in sequences like "Inhale: the fog parted... Exhale: Elias sensed the runaway dream." The perceptual signature shows his mirror-maker's eye in phrases like "labyrinth of glass-like fragility." Some moments drift toward elevated diction ("ethereal flutter," "luminous wisp") that slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias's voice shines in dialogue ("Danger? Bah! Wisdom doesn't come from safe perches") with consistent feisty characterization and age-appropriate grumbling. The narrative maintains stable third-person limited POV with effective free indirect style showing his grief-fogged perspective. However, some passages drift into overly literary register ("verdant labyrinth," "ephemeral vows") that clash with Elias's earthier voice, and Lila's dialogue lacks distinct personality.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the philosophical premise, with distinctive perceptual signatures ("perpetual furrow," "gnawing motivation"). The spectral dialogue effectively uses indirection and implication. Some passages drift toward academic abstraction ("multidimensional etchings," "temporal legacies"), but the voice coheres around Elias's bewildered curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the fantasy setting ("chronal dust," "ethereal wisps," "temporal rifts"). Elara's perception filters through linguistic awareness ("melodies of meaning," "silent harmonies"). However, dialogue lacks naturalistic rhythm ("I've come from a future unraveling") and both characters' speech patterns converge into similar registers without distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature in how Elara experiences time's fluidity. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the narrative-weaving sequence. However, some passages lean toward elevated literary register ("spectral vessel," "saline wind") that occasionally feels performed rather than organic to the dreamlike state.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent scholarly register appropriate to an archivist POV, with selective perception focused on historical details and archival methods. Syntax varies purposefully, accelerating during the climactic rope-weaving. Some filter phrases ("she recognized," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to fantasy ("ethereal mist unfurling," "cacophony of storms") with controlled rhythm that modulates during the examination sequence. POV remains stable with Elara's mapkeeper perception filtering details. However, some passages drift into explanatory mode ("This examination wasn't mere observation; it was a ritual") and repetitive constructions appear ("The stone vibrated...The energy beings' storm met this bloom..."), preventing excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to post-apocalyptic mythic tone. POV stays firmly with Elara throughout. Perceptual signature shows in how she reads patterns everywhere. Some phrases feel overwrought ("fragile hopes like thistles blown across barren fields") and the prose occasionally reaches for literary effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the Archivist's scholarly perspective ("where lightning veined the sky like fractured memories"). The voice modulates effectively with the storm's rhythm, and specialized vocabulary ("Summer-Quill Archivist," "crystal whispering forecourt") creates a distinct texture. No dialogue to evaluate, but the internal focalization remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice through Elias's rhythmic chanting and "serious playfulness" tone that modulates with emotional intensity. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance and selective perception ("ambient awareness"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("unseen gravity," "vibrant defiance") that slightly exceeds the wandering artist's natural lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael's perceptual signature comes through selective attention to pools and creatures ("the way a sea star clung stubbornly, then let go"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, though some narration drifts into elevated register ("fleeting embraces," "liminal moments") slightly beyond a chronicler's natural voice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent lyrical voice with controlled metaphorical density ("flavors of different silences," "gilded hush") that suits the fantastical premise. POV remains stable with Elara's perception filtering the magical elements believably. Some elevated diction ("xenial trellis," "intangibly tangible") occasionally strains against accessibility but maintains internal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("drifting prism terrace," "sky-sea," "vaporous channels") that maintains consistency. Elias's sparse dialogue contrasts effectively with Mira's initial chatter. The perceptual signature focuses on sound levels and atmospheric quietude fitting a gondolier who has "long surrendered to the winds."

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate for the sci-fantasy setting, with controlled vocabulary ("spectral seat," "plasma core"). Some passages achieve rhythmic grace, particularly in descriptive sections. However, the voice lacks distinctive personality—it reads more like competent worldbuilding than a specific consciousness experiencing these events.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("She moved among the shadows tenderly, her hands weaving through their ethereal forms"). POV remains stable with Elara. Dialogue feels somewhat stiff ("But our scars link us still") - more naturalistic subtext would strengthen. The perceptual signature of seeing shadows as living creatures is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "shadowseam wonder" and "virtuously mischievous" creating texture, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond the fantastical elements. The glitchy message formatting provides visual variety, though Elara's internal voice during the dive sequence becomes generic rather than maintaining her established playful-survivor perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with effective free indirect style, particularly in "He was the dynasty ender" and internal musings. Perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices acoustic properties and interprets silence. However, some phrases like "unyielding motivation" and "harmonious secrecy" drift toward writerly abstraction rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    The elevated register fits the mystical atmosphere ("veins of liquid gold," "factually mystical energies") and maintains consistency throughout. However, repetitive constructions like multiple "shivering bliss" instances and similar sentence openings ("He pondered," "He realized," "Elandor began") create mechanical rhythm that undermines the otherworldly voice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent scholarly precision with emotional undertones ("wryly called," "tactfully hopeful"). Free indirect style works well for Elara's interiority. However, some phrases feel writerly rather than lived ("fractured soul," "beacon of compassion"), and the historical document voice could be more distinctly period-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent limited third-person with appropriate perceptual filtering ("she memorized the reflections"). Some passages drift toward elevated register not fully earned by the POV ("auric lagoon," "otherworldly luminescence") creating mild distance. The prose modulates effectively during action sequences but occasionally lapses into abstract summary ("her rebellion dismissed as the folly of a dreamer").

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signature—"mist clung to every surface like a forgotten memory." No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates effectively with scene pressure, though occasional elevated diction ("multifaceted crystals formed an open chamber") slightly exceeds the wandering musician's expected register.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent folkloric register with selective perception ("whispered secrets," "mossy delight"). The perceptual signature—seeing joy in moss and giggles in twigs—distinguishes Elara's worldview. Some phrases edge toward purple ("ethereal beings who inscribed prophecies"), but rhythm generally supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and appropriate vocabulary for a tinkerer-scholar. Voice modulates with discovery ("Heart pounding") and maintains distinct texture through technical language ("gears," "mechanisms"). However, some interiority slides into explanatory mode ("This was the timeframe when coincidence became pattern"), and occasional register elevation ("ethereal escorts") doesn't fully align with Elias's practical perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains an elevated, quasi-mythic register appropriate to alchemical subject matter, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "balanced alchemist stood alone in the rain-washed foundry." POV remains stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("luminous regret gilded his thoughts") without sufficient grounding, and some constructions feel overwrought ("factually mystical" appears forced).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-lyrical register with controlled diction like "spectral defiance" and "luminous ache." The prose texture supports the otherworldly tone without becoming purple. Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("eternal echoes," "frost on spiderwebs") but generally serve atmosphere. Dialogue is minimal but effective in Thorne's confession.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific/clinical diction ("proprioceptively enhanced," "anesthesia's fog") appropriate to the enhanced survivor. Some passages achieve rhythmic control ("She tried to rise, but a wave of dizziness forced her to brace"), though others drift into purple abstraction. No dialogue to evaluate, and the POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the fantastical setting ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition"). However, perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—Elara's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue present to evaluate subtext or naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance and clean free indirect style ("Elias knew better"). Perceptual signature shows in his technical attention to "dust accumulation patterns" and structural anomalies. Some filter verbs could be cut ("Elias felt the familiar weightless burden"), and occasional elevated diction ("ethereal heaviness that pressed without mass") slightly strains the technician POV.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled compression ("reality became negotiable," "dreams haggled with dawn") and character-specific perception in how Elias reads frost as "fractal messages." The prose modulates effectively during rupture ("seismic crack spiderwebbed"), though occasional elevation ("latent energy," "destabilizing potential") slightly distances from Elias's craftsman perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the baroque setting—"gilded arches twisted like forgotten sonnets." The POV remains stable with Elias as focalizer. However, the voice occasionally drifts into overly abstract territory ("temporal currents materialized as shimmering veils"), and lacks the specific perceptual signature that would distinguish Elias's revolutionary poet perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register with purposeful elevated diction ("tinkersong wonder," "covenant of rust"). However, register drift occurs in peak moments—"alchemizing corrosion into gleaming resolve" clashes with the established voice. The narrative stance remains stable in third-person limited, though psychic distance rarely modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining the same removed tone throughout crisis and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with controlled, literary register appropriate to the contemplative tone. Some elevated diction ("resonant hush," "hinged awakening") fits the mystical subject. Minor register drift in places ("sensibly eccentric" feels forced), but perceptual signature remains consistent through Elara's collector's eye for essence and scent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with appropriate perceptual filtering through Elara's artistic lens. Phrases like "spirited driftwood sculptor" and "turbine-hum reverie" create distinctive texture. Some register elevation occurs ("timewoven alliances," "sentinel against the waves") that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon during non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent lyrical voice with controlled psychic distance and effective use of seasonal imagery. The prose maintains a contemplative register appropriate to Elara's artistic sensibility. Some moments of elevated diction ("umbral tenderness," "amber pavilion") enhance rather than distract, though occasionally verge on precious.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinct voice maintains elevated register appropriate to the premise, with controlled rhythm in passages like "shells clattering as if alive with regret." POV remains stable through the retrocognitive shift. Some register drift occurs ("searing reverie," "ethereal trap") but serves the heightened reality.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative descriptions and appropriate diction for the fantasy-tinged setting. POV remains stable with Elias. However, the prose occasionally shifts into explanatory register ("His motivation surged: to reimagine the civilization"), and the perceptual signature could be more distinctly Elias's rather than omniscient-literary.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled diction ("venerable oath scribe," "insidious," "monotone world") that suits Elias's scholarly perspective. Perceptual signature is strong—his attention to emotional patterns, dead languages, and archival details reflects his obsession. Some passages drift into overwrought territory ("velvet shroud," "silent accusations"), but psychic distance modulates effectively during the immersion sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("icebound atrium under starlight," "forgotten breath"). POV remains stable with Elara's perceptions filtering the mystical events. Some register elevation in moments like "furiously tranquil" works as intentional oxymoron but occasionally drifts toward overwrought ("wild serenity eternal").

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains contemplative distance appropriate to Elias's character, with phrases like "ethereal refuge" and "solstice hush" creating consistent texture. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("pious past," "lifeline from shadowed heights") that slightly exceeds the humble tester's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's spiritual nature, with phrases like "flourishing stillness" and "primal elegance" creating atmospheric texture. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—the observations could belong to any contemplative character. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction, and the POV remains stable but generic in its philosophical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with strong perceptual signature in observations like "ghosts flickered into sharper view under the fading light." Some passages drift toward overwrought ("scorched the earth into cracked oblivion"), but the POV holds steady through the revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "texture of time passing"). The prose successfully modulates between action and reflection, though some elevated diction ("iridescent emerald," "verdant walls") occasionally strains against accessibility.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains poetic consistency with phrases like "burnished hush" and "forgotten whispers," though occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The perceptual signature of noticing incomplete beauty stays consistent. Some register elevation ("tapestries of color," "resonant reconfiguration") strains against the intimate POV during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct texture beyond competent description. Phrases like "meticulously recorded observations" and "gently systematic precision" tell character traits rather than embodying them in syntax or rhythm. The POV remains stable but generic, missing opportunities for Elias's specific perceptual signature to color the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("bronze statues whispering secrets in the rain"). The luminous/skeptical tension shapes perception consistently. Some register elevation in places ("inevitable alchemy") but generally maintains coherence. The scientific-poetic fusion mostly works.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled mythic register appropriate to the fable-like tone. Strong perceptual signature in phrases like "spectral horses" and "skeletal wasteland." However, some passages drift into purple prose ("narrow vastness of the blooming jetty") and the elevated diction occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in the dead language invocations.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's "intuitively descriptive" voice creates memorable images like "frozen breath from a forest that whispered farewells." The narration maintains consistent distance and filters the wasteland through both human and canine perception effectively. Some phrases feel overwrought ("bruised purples"), and dialogue occasionally veers toward the precious, but overall voice serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signature around temporal flows. Good modulation between reflection and action. Some filter verb clusters ("she felt," "she could feel") in middle section reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice—"knight of nimble fingers," "cautious abandon." Perceptual signature shows in how Elarion notices magical elements as playful rather than threatening. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("I amend not to steal your game"). Some register elevation in descriptive passages doesn't quite match the playful tone.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "luminous absence" and "nomadic penumbra." Some filter constructions ("Alex sensed," "Alex knew") reduce immediacy, and the lack of dialogue limits voice range assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic-literary register with controlled vocabulary ("mercury-glass seer," "entombed beneath layers of forgetting"). Some passages achieve strong rhythm, particularly the ritual sequence. However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the shape of home," "hidden thunder") without sufficient grounding, and lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would make Elara's specific way of seeing memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on strategic/chess metaphors ("cascade of losses," "seeing the full board"). Purposeful compression in lyric mode works well with taught pattern of stillness/movement. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("fierce repose," "winnow the truths") that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon and some filter-heavy passages.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm: "towers of bone rose like skeletal fingers clawing at the shrouded sky." The perceptual signature—an artist seeing in refractions and echoes—is distinctive. Minor weakness: some phrases edge toward purple prose ("lover's breath," "symphonies and cries into eternal laments").

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with mythic register ("forge of stars," "dire enchantment") suits the alchemical setting. The narrated incantations provide rhythmic variation and character-specific perception. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elowen felt meaning coalesce") and occasional register elevation in stress moments ("his uncertainties alchemized into conviction") slightly diminish immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains a consistent literary register with evocative phrases like "whispered of bygone ships and salty breezes." POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature focuses appropriately on visual and tactile details befitting a painter. Some overwrought moments ("treasures buried in the tide") slightly diminish authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical touches like "cobalt lighthouse" and "screaming tenderness" that suit the romantic tone. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("tender scream that whispered across the waves") but voice remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm—"Night after night, as the moon swelled"—and distinctive perceptual signature through mechanical-organic fusion imagery. The cryptic dialogue carries authentic otherworldly register. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("geography of loss") that slightly exceeds the established voice range.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive vocabulary suited to Elara's rational forager perspective ("precise calculations of soil, scent, and season"). The narrative voice effectively modulates during the ritual sequence, tightening syntax as wind tears at her. Some filter phrases ("she felt a shiver") and abstract constructions ("psychological haven taking root") slightly distance the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("where the sea whispered secrets to the fading light") and consistent perceptual signature focused on gaps and absences. The prose modulates effectively between external description and vision sequences. Slight register elevation in vision descriptions ("snow-capped peaks," "alpine mist") fits the borrowed memory conceit, though occasionally approaches purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains consistency with phrases like "empirically intuitive" recurring meaningfully, and the perceptual signature shows Elias noticing "the precise curl of a map's edge." Some passages drift toward elevated register ("ethereal vines," "spectral pattern") that slightly strain the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maintains consistent close third POV with Elara, using effective free indirect style in "Tonight, we seek the source." Voice modulates appropriately with tension, though diction occasionally elevates beyond character register ("malevolent sprites," "filigree patterns"). Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Elara's "softly commanding" tone consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "embers kissing in the wind" and manages some distinct perceptual signatures. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("equations of emotion: affection as a constant"), and Thorne's single line of dialogue lacks distinguishing character beyond content.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a literary register appropriate to a dream chronicler, with controlled diction like "feral nostalgia gnawing at my edges" and consistent interiority. The perceptual signature—filtering experience through narrative frames—is distinct, though some phrases like "jaded wonder" feel more like labels than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with Elara, using measured, contemplative diction that matches her methodical repair work. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate hesitation and indirection ("I've heard you can fix anything that flows"). However, some moments drift into elevated register ("invisible poetry," "emotional terrain") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting a scholar-mystic. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara notices crystallization and storm patterns. Psychic distance modulates appropriately during stress. Some filter verb accumulation ("she knew," "she felt") in middle sections reduces immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent gothic-literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. However, the prose occasionally strains toward purple ("storm-tossed sea," "ethereal silence"), and Lila's dialogue feels more thematic vessel than authentic speech ("Your gossip columns exorcise others' demons, but mine you planted yourself").

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register with controlled rhythm ("resounding hush," "echoes of forgotten eras whispered without sound"). However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into purple territory ("labyrinth of towering shelves carved from petrified starlight") without sufficient grounding in character perspective or concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly effective in the countdown sequence where shorter, memory-focused sentences build tension. Perceptual signature shows in details like "squinting through lashes at the swirling water" and the focus on mechanical/hydraulic imagery. Some elevated diction ("infinitesimal boundaries," "mesmerizing dance") occasionally drifts from Elias's practical perspective, and repetitive constructions appear ("Elias had always been," "Elias felt," "Elias understood").

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with technical precision balanced against lyrical observation. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("quiet wildfire" metaphor) but mostly controlled. Dialogue between Elara and Kai feels natural with appropriate subtext, though brief.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    The academic voice suits Elara but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("petrichor and the faint promise of renewal"). The cryptic graffiti quotes feel artificially literary rather than authentically urban, though internal consistency holds.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent melancholic register with phrases like "melodically haunted" and "cultivated estrangement," though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("curator of connections"). Dialogue feels slightly literary rather than natural ("This wrong number taught me to start painting again"). The perceptual signature of noticing sound and connection patterns is consistent but not deeply distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled diction ("bruised purples," "ephemeral"). Some passages achieve genuine texture through specific sensory details. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elias as archivist doesn't fundamentally shape how he notices or describes, and elevated phrases like "spectral whispers" feel more writerly than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice balances lyrical world-building ("twilight of a world governed by polite anarchy") with Elias's desperate humor. His bad puns effectively embody his social awkwardness. Dialogue feels natural when present, though the rapid-fire rumor variations strain believability slightly. Perceptual signature remains consistent through Elias's logistics-minded observations.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "fingers that danced like spiders on silk" and controlled rhythm that mirrors Elara's methodical search. The perceptual signature—a blind mapmaker experiencing through touch and absorbed languages—creates distinct texture, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("elongated moment to delve inward").

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("gravitational eddies," "radio waves") and poetic observation ("fickle lovers," "universe's unpredictable arms"). Some filter verb clusters ("Elara felt," "she realized") dull immediacy in middle beats, though the perceptual signature remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent melancholic register with moments of lyricism ("liquid silver," "ghost haunting"), though lacks distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue exists only in whispers and sign language, creating interesting texture. Some register elevation ("ethereal," "cartographer") slightly exceeds established POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the reflective, quest-like tone. Perceptual signature shows in how Elias analyzes artistic details ("chisel marks," "methodical cuts"). Some filter verb clusters ("he sensed," "he found," "he discovered") dull immediacy. Prose occasionally drifts toward purple ("volcanic tenderness, a simmering passion beneath his calm exterior").

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the science-fiction setting, with consistent use of synesthetic imagery ("sound waves curling like vines"). However, several instances of abstract emotional labeling ("auroral sorrow," "quietly rebellious spirit") and filter constructions ("she felt the weight") diminish immediacy during crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled diction matching Elias's careful, observant nature, and his perceptual signature of identifying walks remains consistent. Dialogue between Elias and Marcus effectively contrasts their approaches. Some elevated diction ("serpentine route glowing faintly") occasionally drifts from the maintenance worker POV, and Marcus's voice could be more distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Phrases like "spiralingly calm" and "stillwater tension" feel forced rather than organic to character perception. The guardian's silence works conceptually but Elara's interiority relies on abstract emotional labels ("burned in her chest," "weight of darkness").

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"where ancient tomes whispered secrets to those who listened" establishes texture held throughout. POV remains stable in close third. However, some phrases edge toward purple prose ("ethereal twilight when echoes of history intertwined with foreshadows of fate"), and the perceptual signature could be more distinctly Elias's rather than omniscient-literary.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "grace of a current weaving through kelp" that match Elara's fluid nature. Dialogue carries authentic subtext in exchanges like "You chain yourself to this dock" with natural indirection. The perceptual signature stays focused on water imagery and movement throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's theatrical baritone narrations create distinctive voice texture—"Behold, the noble knife descends upon the stubborn wood"—that serves both character and method. POV remains controlled with selective perception of surveillance threats. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("festered unspoken," "emotional void") that strain against the character's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through phrases like "cloud-shadow poet" and "lantern-moth hush" that maintain atmospheric consistency. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to heightened communion. Minor register drift occurs with "aesthetically driven" appearing four times as prompt-like insertion rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, poetic diction appropriate to the post-apocalyptic fantasy setting ("shattered remnants," "labyrinth of fractured glass"). The perceptual signature of a colorblind painter seeing "only shades of gray" shapes the entire narrative lens. Some register elevation in phrases like "bartered awakenings" and "ethereal entities" occasionally distances from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond technical descriptions. Elara's voice in quoted questions feels authentic but her interiority relies on abstract concepts rather than embodied perception. The prose doesn't modulate with emotional intensity—maintaining the same measured tone throughout despite the supposed peak at the summit.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the timeless setting, with some lovely constructions ("fragments of memories woven into lockets"). However, both Elias and Lira's dialogue lacks distinction—their speech patterns converge into similar formal registers, missing the opportunity to differentiate through idiom or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical-analytical register appropriate to Elara's POV, with phrases like "reverse engineering the querent's life story" fitting her method. Dialogue differentiates adequately between characters. However, several instances of elevated diction ("labyrinth of abandoned high-rises," "rhythmic accompaniment") drift from the established voice without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains consistent mythic register with controlled rhythm, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic fantasy narrator. No dialogue appears, and the voice doesn't modulate significantly with emotional intensity, remaining at the same elevated pitch throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive perceptual signature shows in Elara's "sharp-eyed" attention to dusk transitions and "softly deliberate" movements, maintained consistently through action verbs. Minor drift occurs in abstract passages about dream-sharing protocols, but voice recovers for the charged ending.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("starshine filtering through the mist"). Yet the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("shimmering stillness," "quietly vivid") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would make Elias's specific way of seeing the world memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("meteor hush, that profound silence following a celestial streak"). POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation in peak moments ("displaced miracle," "telepathic pleas insistent") slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon but serves the fantastical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled elevated diction fitting a crystal gazer's perspective ("liminal hour," "psychometry," "interstices"). Some overwrought phrases ("dust motes danced like silent specters") but rhythm modulates effectively with discovery. The perceptual signature of spatial imagination is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register with controlled rhythm, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("shadowed rapture upon the archway"). The voice effectively modulates between cosmic grandeur and intimate reflection. Some phrases like "moonstruck dreamer" and "eternal cycle" feel generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "glowing dunes in bloom" and "spectral caravans," though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("quantum wanderer that defied fixed location"). The perceptual signature of seeing "fractures in reality" is distinctive, but some passages lean toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature with selective noticing: Elias perceives the forest through philosophical and acoustic filters, attending to "electromagnetic whispers" and "the hum of insight." Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the climactic unraveling sequence. Voice maintains consistency through academic-philosophical register appropriate to the character. Minor issue with some elevated diction ("inexorable logic") that occasionally feels authorial rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with selective perception filtered through Elara's emotional state, and the lyrical voice suits the mythic tone. Dialogue feels somewhat archetypal ("You seek what lies unused within") rather than naturalistic, and while atmospheric, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that distances from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent distance with evocative prose like "frostbitten hope" and selective perception filtered through Elias's musical past. The lack of dialogue (justified by muteness) creates sustained interiority. However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated literary diction that doesn't fully align with a bellhop's perspective, particularly in philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elevated fantasy register maintains consistency with phrases like "diminutive titan" and "pause of shifting constellations." POV stays controlled in third-limited following Elowen. Some overwriting ("graceful collapse," "elegant unraveling") but rhythm generally supports the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific-poetic register ("renewable whispers," "defiant swells") with controlled rhythm that mirrors ocean cycles. Perceptual signature shows through technical focus ("thermoclines," "bioluminescent panels") filtered with emotional weight. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("vast embrace") but rhythm control during the revelation sequence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with selective perception ("her toes gripping the cool, oil-stained ground"). Voice modulates between lyrical observation and action, though some passages drift into elevated register ("celestial tapestry that the naked eye could only glimpse") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-naturalistic register with controlled syntax ("where sulfurous mists curled like forgotten dreams"). However, some passages drift into elevated diction that strains the POV's plausibility ("insurgent grandmother" as self-description), and dialogue is absent where it might have grounded character interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close-third POV with strong perceptual signature ("salt-laden winds whispered," "pearl-like nodules that gleamed"). Some filter-verb clustering ("he believed," "he imagined," "he thought") during the crisis slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with literary elevation appropriate to the protagonist artist, using selective perception like focusing on "dust-laden desk" and "spine of a weary giant." The rhetorical questions feel natural to Elias's introspective character. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract territory ("reality itself was shattering into pieces") that momentarily breaks the intimate POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elowen's scholarly perspective, with controlled syntax like "wind-carved encampment, where sandstone spires twisted like frozen flames." The narrative voice remains stable in third-person limited. However, some phrases edge toward purple prose ("bruised but brightening sky") and the psychic distance remains uniformly distant, missing opportunities for intimacy during peak discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction, reading as competent genre prose without memorable texture. POV control is stable with no head-hopping. However, register drift into academic abstractions ("systemic corruption," "societal order through enforced ignorance") clashes with the intimate frozen setting, and emotional peaks default to cliché ("heart pounded").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent texture with selective perception ("whispers in the wind that others dismissed as mere gusts") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional beats. The prose achieves distinct character-specific perception, though occasional elevated diction ("inculcating plants with values") slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong perceptual signature with Eron reading waves "like currents in a familiar sea" and distinctive prose rhythm that modulates with the garden's chaos. The voice maintains consistency through heightened moments. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("divine resonance that could soothe the wildest souls") that briefly exceeds the POV's established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and clear perceptual signature (Elara notices "subtle shifts," "hidden inks"). Prose occasionally slips into explanatory register ("that was how she thought of them") and some metaphors feel overwrought ("comet's tail streaking through the night"). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive texture ("constellation tattooist, inking stars onto skin"). The perceptual signature shows Elara noticing through an artist's lens. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("Mama, cold... alone... find me"). Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("dissonance of old guilt that clawed at her soul").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent whimsical-mystic register with controlled diction like "lilac-hued discomfort" and "emergent hush," though Elara's brief dialogue lacks the distinctiveness of the narration. The perceptual signature focuses on visual patterns and social undercurrents, supporting her artist-observer role.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with distinctive perceptual signature ("fragments of what was once a seamless blue vault hung like jagged glass"). The retrocognitive visions create purposeful POV slippage that serves the story's aims, though some phrases edge toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The synesthetic POV creates a distinct perceptual signature with consistent sensory cross-wiring ("golden sparks," "honeyed violins"). Some passages drift toward overwriting ("fractured veil," "luminous possibility"), but the voice maintains coherence and the free indirect style cleanly tracks Elara's emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains Alex's perspective consistently with appropriate skeptical-affectionate coloring ("rolled his eyes at her crystals"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fractally precise, like infinite patterns unfolding") that strains against the established voice. Dialogue feels functional but lacks distinctive character rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific-poetic register appropriate to Elara's profession. Perceptual signature shows through technical observations like "piezoelectric crystals" alongside wonder. No dialogue to evaluate. Some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she knew," "she recognized") dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic-archival voice with controlled diction ("fossilized resin," "unearthed silence") that matches the warehouse setting. POV remains stable in limited third focused on Eland, with appropriate access to his thoughts and perceptions. The perceptual signature shows in selective details like noticing button engravings and echo shifts. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds Eland's established lexicon ("raw possibility blooming within him").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent register with selective perception fitting a burned spy (scanning horizons, measuring steps). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and restraint. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("Elias felt," "He knew") and some repetitive sentence openings in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with phrases like "spindrift serenity" and "percolating insights," though this elevated diction occasionally feels disconnected from a coachman's likely lexicon. The perceptual signature—Elias's patient, detail-oriented awareness—is distinctive. However, the narrative distance remains too steady; it doesn't modulate with discovery moments that should create more intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent zen-minded POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("shadows lengthened and shortened, a method as reliable as the wheel's turn"). Prose modulates appropriately with discovery. Some filter verb accumulation ("he saw," "he felt") dulls immediacy in the timeline sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with controlled rhythm—"the water gleamed like liquid silver," "petal fluttered down like a sigh." The perceptual signature shows Elara noticing precise details (notched metal, mirror angles) while maintaining poetic awareness. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("ethereal glows," "wistfully pragmatic") but generally serve the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting with phrases like "centuries compressed into a single breath" and "songs of wind and starlight." The perceptual signature shows in how Elara experiences the library through tidal metaphors. Deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract language ("fierce independence," "spectral remnants") that distances from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("In the hush that followed the cloud bursts"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elias sees poetic connections (spiral as thread, installation as tapestry). Brief dialogue feels natural with subtext, though Mira's lines edge toward over-articulation for the emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent academic-tinged narration appropriate to Elara's role, with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows through technical focus ("subsonic frequencies," "vector"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal grit," "inscrutable games") that feels forced rather than organic to the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm, though diction occasionally strains ("shadowed nexus," "forgotten veins"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices escape routes and spatial constraints. Some phrases feel overwrought ("rebellious force where dimensions defied their confines"), creating distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and employs specific diction like "calipers, grids" that reflects Elias's methodical nature. POV control holds steady throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("dormant empathy he scarcely acknowledged, buried under layers"), and some passages read as exposition rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent gothic register with controlled diction ("verdigris surface," "muffled screams") that matches the atmospheric intent. POV remains stable with Elara's selective perception of decay and moisture, though some passages drift toward elevated description that slightly exceeds her librarian lexicon ("absorbent terror that seeped into bones").

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive phrasing ("bridge-song fiddler," "eyes like shattered glass"). The perceptual signature shows in Elias's musical lens and "dynamically observant" nature. However, some passages drift into purple prose ("starlight doubting its own existence"), and the narrative occasionally tells what should be shown ("he felt the weight lift").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent literary distance with controlled diction ("dusky harmony," "perceptively calm") that matches Elias's measured character. Some passages drift into elevated register ("symbols of paths taken and abandoned"), and Victor's section lacks the textural depth of earlier passages. No dialogue appears, avoiding potential voice contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "where starlight filtered through ancient lenses." However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the vast, indifferent cosmos") that doesn't fully align with Elara as a character. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains epic-fantasy register consistently but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond genre conventions. Phrases like "war drum muffled by mist" and "frozen steel" feel stock rather than character-specific. The prose competently handles the mystical elements but doesn't achieve memorable distinctiveness. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("cobalt glade at dusk," "quantum blooms erupted"). Some register elevation in exposition ("unintended symbiosis," "fractured world") slightly exceeds natural POV lexicon. Perceptual signature remains consistent through Elara's visionary lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Elara's idealistic worldview - she sees bones as "forgotten flesh" and roots as "veins." The Keeper's dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly register. Some filter verb accumulation ("she knew," "she believed") slightly dulls immediacy in places. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of transforming decay into meaning stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with Jack's expertise coloring perception ("mid-19th century sterling," "Depression-era glass"). The shift between technical assessment and emotional memory feels natural. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Some phrases like "confidently uncertain demeanor" feel slightly workshopped, and the final paragraph's "faint, longing hum of purpose reborn" strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains scholarly precision appropriate to a cuneiform translator ("liminal hush," "spectral weights"), though it occasionally drifts into overwritten territory ("swirling mists," "ethereal soil shimmered like stardust"). The perceptual signature of methodical observation holds but lacks distinctive rhythm under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains a mythic, contemplative register appropriate to the eternal librarian figure. Phrases like "titan-gear librarian tended to his eternal duties" and "winter sun's serene glow" create consistent texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels detached from immediate experience, particularly in abstract passages about identity and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective details like "faint tang of minerals" and "crystal-dusted floor" that suit an inspector's observational nature. However, register drift appears in elevated moments—"latent radiance waiting to be awakened" and "tapestry of the others" clash with the established pragmatic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with distinct perceptual signatures like Elias's methodical map-reading mindset and his focus on water imagery. Some filter verb clusters appear ("he believed," "he pondered") but serve the reflective mode. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the raw post-medication descriptions and the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated fantasy register appropriate to the veiled dreamer character. Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to ethereal details and temporal mechanics. Some filter verb clusters ("Elara watched," "Elara sensed") and abstract emotional labels ("cautious exuberance") reduce immediacy during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains an elevated, consistent register appropriate to Elara's scholarly perspective, with controlled use of color ("mulberry," "crimson") and texture ("velvet") creating coherent atmosphere. The plant telepathy adds a distinct perceptual layer, though dialogue is absent and some passages drift into overly ornate description.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic setting, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "radiant hush" and "lucidly watchful." The perceptual signature shows through specific focus on light, crystalline textures, and threshold states. Some repetition of "radiant hush" and "lucidly watchful" creates mild echo without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains consistent mythic-lyrical register appropriate to the ethereal setting, with selective perception focused on luminous and textural details. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("You are safe here"), though the narrative occasionally drifts into elevated diction that tells rather than embodies emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and sophisticated diction fits the philosophical tone. However, some passages drift into overly abstract register ("protected vulnerability," "sincere concern that hid his own inner fragility") that doesn't fully match a scene of immediate consultation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited through Elara's perspective with controlled psychic distance. Dialogue feels stilted ("Enter the trance with me") lacking naturalistic rhythm. The narrative voice tends toward elevated register ("celestial rhythms, promising insights") that occasionally drifts from character-grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent epic register with controlled rhythm and deliberate archaisms ("ages," "eons," "sentinels"). The POV remains stable in omniscient distance appropriate to the mythic tone. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("spectral ravens with wings like shards of night"), and the voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond generic fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and atmospheric control with phrases like "brilliant dimness" and "mechanical mimicry." Perceptual signature shows in how Elowen notices light and shadow throughout. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal vapors that swirled eternally") that doesn't fully match the character's established modest nature.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to the contemplative protagonist—"fragile orbs of light drifting upward like silent meteors in reverse." The prose rhythm modulates effectively from meditative opening through urgent swimming to transcendent discovery. Minor register drift in the exposition about the Aether Inn feels slightly mechanical against the otherwise organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the cosmic scope, with selective perception focused on amber veins, coin etchings, and static patterns. "Phantom glows in her memory" and "singularity's echo" show distinct texture. Some phrases like "quietly enthusiastic resolve" feel forced to incorporate required elements rather than emerging naturally from voice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "shadows that whispered of eternal loss" and controlled psychic distance throughout. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral," "kaleidoscope") occasionally drifts from the established register but rhythm modulates effectively with the ritual's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with fantasy register and controls rhythm during the ritual sequence. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("cosmic imbalance tilted the very fabric of reality") that don't match Elandor's naive perspective, and no distinct perceptual signature emerges to distinguish how this particular mage sees his world.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance and selective perception (Elias notices photographs but initially suppresses their meaning). Prose rhythm modulates with discovery, tightening during the father revelation. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary diction ("mirrored hush," "tapestry that bound") that feels imposed rather than emerging from Elias's consciousness as established.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate for fantasy alchemy, though it tends toward purple prose ("prismatic mists danced like forgotten dreams"). The POV remains stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything poetically rather than through an alchemist's specific lens. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("ancient freshness," "touch of wonder") weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV that modulates effectively during crisis moments. The "soundless echo" creates a unique perceptual signature. Dialogue through radio transmissions feels natural and advances plot. Minor register elevation in phrases like "ethereal realm" slightly mismatches the technical problem-solving voice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and mystical register appropriate to the setting. Dialogue between Kai and his clone ("You are but a shell") carries clear subtext about worthiness and completeness. However, both characters' speech patterns converge rather than displaying distinct lexicons, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("ethereal perches," "convoluted thread") that feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance and vocabulary fitting an educated protagonist. However, the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices things generically rather than through the specific lens of an escape room designer who would see patterns and mechanisms differently.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent lyrical voice with effective rhythm modulation, particularly in the long, flowing sentences that mirror wind and memory. Strong perceptual signature in musical/symphonic metaphors throughout ("notes on a staff," "conducting chaos into joy"). Slight register elevation in places ("mournfully eager drive," "crystallized") that occasionally distances from immediacy, though it suits the ghostly perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical voice with distinctive phrases like "shadowy amalgamation of fur and forgotten tomes" and controlled psychic distance throughout the guardian's meditation. However, several passages drift into elevated register ("harmonious dance," "fragile peace") that doesn't fully align with the feral guardian's nature, and the lack of dialogue or distinct secondary voices limits range demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy-alchemical setting, with controlled rhythm during the ritual sequences. However, several instances of abstract telling ("stoically sensitive grace," "hopeless figure") and filter constructions weaken immediacy. The narrative voice occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("a perfect emblem for the creative destruction he planned") rather than trusting the dramatization, though sensory perception remains consistently filtered through Elias's exhausted determination.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent register blending technical ("celestial signal interpreter") with poetic ("whispers of stars"). Perceptual signature strong in how Elara notices cosmic patterns in mundane decay. Some register drift occurs with "methodically letting go of preconceived notions" which reads more clinical than the established lyrical tone, creating minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, fabulist register appropriate to magical realism, with phrases like "where the sea met the sky in an endless blur" establishing tone. However, Elias's interiority lacks distinct perceptual signature—his thoughts could belong to any optimistic protagonist. The prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("stalactites hung like frozen comets") without earning the elevation through character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("thin and resilient, pulsing faintly with an inner warmth") and perceptual signature focused on textures and architectural precision. Some register elevation in phrases like "rational enchantment: magic grounded in physics" doesn't fully match Elias's embodied perspective, and dialogue remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's contemplative nature, with phrases like "abyssal depths" and "ethereal plumes" creating distinct texture. The narrative distance remains stable. However, the voice lacks urgency even during the breakthrough moment, maintaining the same measured tone throughout without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and POV control, with perceptual details filtered through Elara's specialized awareness ("erratic beats that mimicked heart rhythms"). Dialogue is minimal but functional when present. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("mist-clad atrium," "emotional residues") that slightly exceeds the established voice's natural lexicon during non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate register for Alex's spelunker background. However, abstract phrases like "pull he couldn't ignore" and "profound silence fell" lack the specificity of lived experience. The narrative voice doesn't degrade convincingly under the extreme stress of claustrophobic swimming.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance, and Alex's perceptual focus on counting and technical details fits his character. Elara's fragmented digital speech ("Alex... failure is the forge...") effectively conveys her corrupted state. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "spectral code") that doesn't fully align with Alex's established perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to mythic storytelling, with controlled rhythm and textured diction ("bleeding red over the bone towers"). POV remains stable in omniscient distance. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("velvet of night"), and the lack of dialogue means we miss opportunities for voice distinction, but the perceptual signature of texture-as-language is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative descriptions ("frost-kissed hills," "starlit secrets"). However, register drift appears in abstract phrases like "tapestry of wary wonders" and "alchemized into ironic joy" that clash with more grounded observation. The voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lyrical voice with phrases like "velvet thunder" and "seismic whispers" creates distinct texture appropriate to the fantastical setting. POV remains stable in third-limited focused on Elara. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("syncopation," "seismic") that feels slightly removed from the character's immediate experience, and some phrases like "resonantly soft" appear repetitively without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a cautious smuggler ("telltale signs of spies," "cloaked drone"). However, register occasionally elevates beyond the established tone ("labyrinth of neon-blue stalls," "bruised purple") and dialogue is minimal, missing opportunities for subtext and character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("misting hush," "whispering gleam") that matches Elias's quiet nature and the mystical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "where night bled into dawn" and "stories weren't linear paths but hyperbolic journeys."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lyric voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting a night librarian's contemplative nature. Phrases like "forgotten thought" and "velvet depths" establish texture, while the photography sequence modulates effectively under emotional pressure. Some constructions feel artificially literary ("hollowed-out book of maritime myths"), but overall the voice coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "unassumingly bold" threading through. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the hush of cosmic possibility") that doesn't fully align with a locksmith's perspective. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits voice distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision ("chronically curious," "experimental botanical dome") fitting the folklorist POV. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("skeletal hulls," "ethereal veil") slightly strains the established voice. Clean POV control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, atmospheric prose appropriate to the mystical setting—"veils of color that danced like silent auroras." POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature filtering the supernatural through craft metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistent erudite register appropriate to Elias's expertise ("rain-scoured fresco vault," "ephemeral shapes"), with controlled rhythm that mirrors his methodical observation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent analytical register with selective perception ("his lights caught a glint"). Dialogue with "Mort" feels natural as internal conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    Distinct voice with "tinkersong wonder" and inventive compound descriptors ("driftingly alert," "spectral minstrel"). POV remains stable with Elowen until the necessary shift to Lira. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ethereal realm, suspended between sky and storm, pulsed with the anticipation of tempests") that strains against the established whimsical-technical fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with appropriate lexicon ("trepidation," "affectionate detachment") and clean free indirect style. However, syntactic variety is limited with repetitive "Elias [verb]" constructions, and the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices things generically rather than through his specific servant-turned-aide lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, melancholic register appropriate to the grieving meteorologist ("sorrowful cumulus, joyful cirrus"). The perceptual signature—seeing emotions in weather patterns—is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains literary precision with phrases like "forgotten whispers" and "heightened stillness." POV stays controlled through Elara's artist-perception.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person omniscient maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the narrative voice feels generic rather than filtered through specific consciousness. No dialogue appears despite multiple characters present, missing opportunities for voice distinction and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("eons of turning gears," "whispers of fate").

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong narrative voice with distinctive texture ("clung to the cliffside like a desperate lover"). The perceptual signature shows in Elara's precise observations and casual technical commentary. Minor inconsistencies appear when voice occasionally shifts to more elevated register during exposition of the orchard's history.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's scientific POV consistently filters perception ("orchestrated thoughts like symphonies," "molecular chains," "monomers into resilient structures") creating a distinct voice. The dialogue is minimal but effective ("It's us...divergent paths braiding back"). Some phrases like "symphonically minded brain" feel slightly forced as character markers, and emotional states occasionally drift toward clinical description rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose maintains a distinctive ethereal register ("mercury dreams," "swirling sea of clouds") that matches the fantastical setting, with controlled rhythm especially in the incision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "walls of baked clay stood defiant against the endless sands." POV remains stable in close third. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("his mind teetering on the edge of waking") that doesn't fully align with a chef's likely lexicon, and dialogue is entirely absent, missing an opportunity for character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with phrases like "threads of silver" and "whispered the secrets of the cosmos." However, this poetic voice occasionally obscures clarity, and Elara's direct speech ("Revive, amico") feels disconnected from her established narrative voice. The multilingual elements serve theme but aren't integrated naturally into the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains consistency with technical vocabulary ("synaptic plasticity," "neural tech") appropriate to the engineer protagonist. However, the prose tends toward abstract philosophizing ("entangled memories that linked his childhood ambitions with the failures of adulthood") rather than immediate perception, creating distance where intimacy would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Elara's perceptual signature shows in how she processes the grotto through her "refracting" mind, though this could be more distinctively rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. "Symphonically minded" characterization shapes perception effectively. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tender moment when dawn coaxed") that doesn't fully match Elara's embodied perspective, and some filter constructions ("she realized," "she felt") dull immediacy during key discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated, sensory-rich prose matching Elara's herbalist perspective. Her perceptual signature through smell is distinctive. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("pulsed with an undercurrent of wisdom") and lacks rhythmic variation under pressure - the voice doesn't modulate when the flower blooms.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Prose has moments of distinct texture ("whispering canopies," "crimson bubbles") but lacks a strong perceptual signature specific to Lira beyond generic pilot competence. No dialogue to evaluate. Voice modulates slightly during the inversion sequence but could belong to any competent adventurer.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    The clinical, precise voice suits an investigator's POV, with technical vocabulary and methodical observations maintaining consistency. Perceptual signature shows in how Mara notices wind patterns and structural details others might miss.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical register appropriate to the ritual context. The synesthetic perception creates a distinct narrative texture. However, interiority remains surface-level without revealing character-specific thought patterns or emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains an elevated register appropriate to the conceptual material ("cryptic precision," "lucid turbulence"). However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—descriptions feel authored rather than filtered through Elias's mathematician-of-emotion perspective. The ambiguous printed phrases work well as voice elements but needed more consistent POV grounding throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the mythic tone, with selective perception focused on auroras, relics, and transformative moments rather than mundane details.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistent lyric distance but suffers from register drift into elevated abstractions ("latent sacrifice," "raveling silence") that feel imposed rather than emerging from Elara's consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains consistency but lacks a distinctive voice, relying on elevated fantasy diction ("azure defiance," "nascent understanding") that creates distance rather than immediacy. The POV remains stable but emotionally muted during what should be transformative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception ("warmly observant eyes missed nothing") and character-specific diction like "luminescent ache." The prose modulates appropriately during the ghost encounter, tightening syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains an elevated, mythic register appropriate to Elowen's spectral nature but occasionally drifts into purple territory ("wheeled eternally," "emerald veins unearthed centuries ago").

No dialogue appears to test naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with Elias's watchful, color-attuned perception shaping descriptions like "jasmine tea that tasted of distant storms."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "scattered memory keeper" and "woven dawns," creating appropriate atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice maintains consistency with educated, introspective narration fitting Elias's character. Some passages achieve distinction ("the bell tinkled softly, and the scent of aged paper welcomed him like an old friend").

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "heuristically gentle" and "creeping normality" establishing distinct diction. POV remains stable in close third.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature through taste-based navigation and luminous skin creates distinctive voice. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical description and focused action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with distinctive voice in phrases like "emerald blisters" and "morning dew." The perceptual signature shows in selective botanical and atmospheric details.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.6)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and employs lyrical phrasing ("lavender field tucked behind," "perceptively calm grace"), but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything with equal, measured attention.

    Elara's perceptual signature—seeing patterns in drips, poetry in decay—is distinct and consistent. The prose modulates between lyrical description and introspective quiet effectively. Some phrases like "watchful dreamer" and "quietly proactive" feel workshopped rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("feral nexus where mists coiled like forgotten breaths"). POV modulation tracks emotional intensity, particularly in the compressed urgency of final passages. Perceptual signature shows through Elias's writer-specific lens (stories as living things, reality as manuscript).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with Elias's whimsical yet purposeful nature, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("verdant arbor where ancient trees intertwined like lovers' fingers").

Prose rhythm effectively modulates with the ritual's progression, accelerating as the magic takes hold.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the alchemist-narrator, with controlled rhythm during the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with distinctive phrasing ("store wonder in the cellar of reason") and controlled psychic distance. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ethereal crops, gathered not for immediate consumption") that strains against the locksmith's practical perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains a consistent mythic-lyrical register with phrases like "boundary-lessly trapped" and "whalebone reverie" that match the fantastical premise. The controlled repetition of "orient," "calcify," and "fractal" creates rhythmic cohesion. Some filter phrases like "she realized" and "she believed" could be more immediate, particularly during the ritual sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in "First lesson: bravery wasn't in the spotlight, but in the quiet aftermath." POV remains stable with appropriate access to Elara's memories. Minor repetition of "rust-hued peace" and some filter-heavy passages ("she realized," "she sought") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled imagery ("kinetic lagoon," "fractured stillness"). The chronological confusion manifests through syntax ("years—or was it moments?—ago"). Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("spectral echo," "talisman"), but overall texture supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency with Elara's engineering perspective shaping perception ("functionally creative mind," technical observations). Prose rhythm varies appropriately, though some passages drift into elevated register ("intrepid souls who charted paths") that doesn't fully align with the character's practical focus. No dialogue appears, which is acceptable, but the narrative voice occasionally explains rather than embodies Elara's state.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "tick a whisper of forgotten eras." The narrative voice suits Elias's introspective nature. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into purple territory, and the perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness - this could be any sensitive artist rather than specifically a clock scribe's way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with selective perception fitting an experienced seeker ("scaffolded on falsehoods," "dissect their tales").

Some phrases edge toward writerly abstraction ("serene upheaval," "twilight vein of water") that slightly distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct philosophical voice emerges through "Each seed in his satchel was a tiny universe" and patient observation filtered through collector's perspective. The weaver's "voice a soft ripple in the hush" differentiates adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled, literary register appropriate to the reflective protagonist. Strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices decay and splendor simultaneously. Some syntactic monotony in the longer sentences and occasional drift toward purple prose ("luminous pathways," "vivid echo of shared memories") that doesn't quite match the character's practical vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic register but suffers from repetitive constructions ("he hypothesized," "hypothesizing") that create mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with educated, observational tone befitting a "luminous skeptic" ("piezoelectric fragments," "holographic repository"). However, register occasionally drifts into overly ornate territory ("sidereal patience, the kind that mirrored the stars' slow, unyielding orbit") that feels more authorial than character-driven. Perceptual signature stays focused on analytical interpretation of mystical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains ethereal consistency through phrases like "shimmering veil of memories" and "nebulous light," with controlled rhythm in the sonar sequence ("Ping—echo—adjust"). However, register drift appears in abstract passages ("algorithms that could model endless loops," "infinite variances") that clash with the otherworldly POV's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"fiercely meditative," "thundering calm"—that supports the contemplative tone. The ghost's dialogue carries appropriate spectral authority without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent formality appropriate to Elias's precise nature, with controlled syntax like "callused from years of meticulous adjustments."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong atmospheric voice with consistent "velveteen" texture and controlled rhythm throughout. The perceptual signature shows in details like "chess clock had run down" and "cobalt walls amplified every sound," maintaining Elias's gentle but observant perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a distinctive formal register appropriate to the fantasy setting. POV remains stable throughout with controlled psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent formality matching Elias's diligent nature, with controlled syntax like "His motivation burned quietly." The perceptual signature shows in specific details like "fingers stained with ink." However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("ember alcove shrouded by perpetual mist") that slightly exceeds the copyist's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and philosophical register appropriate to Elias's character, with controlled rhythm in key moments ("The chair had rocked him through decades, a constant in the ever-shifting gallery"). However, some passages drift into elevated diction that feels detached from immediate sensation, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent philosophical register with distinctive phrases like "sedimentary layers" and "mechanical poetry," though some passages drift into elevated diction ("epistemic folly," "sedimentary epochs") that slightly exceeds the wannabe philosopher's plausible lexicon. The abrasive calm tone modulates effectively during the agonizing discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with musical metaphors and autumn imagery creating a distinct texture, though diction occasionally elevates beyond the intimate POV ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned").

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Distinct voice with culinary metaphors ("Life's like a stew") and sensory-rich perception fitting a chef character. Some register drift into academic terminology ("synaptic plasticity," "neural wipes") that strains POV credibility. Dialogue is minimal but characteristic when present.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated fantasy register ("amber glow of nectar dusk," "honeyed light") that matches the world's blend of nature and technology. Thorne's dialogue carries his constraint naturally ("Drone beehive failure, that's why"), though Elara's interiority tends toward exposition ("picturing the tower's inner workings") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive phrases like "hushed blaze" and "creeping normality noticer." POV holds steady through Elias's perceptual signature of noticing subtle displacements, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("silent inferno of revelation").

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Telepathic dialogue creates effective subtext through Liriel's "incisively kind" voice that "cuts through shock with compassionate precision," though some phrasing like "scalpel wrapped in silk" feels overwrought. POV remains stable in close third with Elara, but occasional register elevations ("verdant haven," "sentinel") clash with her practical diver perspective. The voice modulates appropriately during emotional peaks but lacks a fully distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, though diction shifts into academic register ("quod erat demonstrandum") that fits the mathematician character. Voice lacks distinct perceptual signature - Elias notices mathematically but prose doesn't reflect unique rhythms of mathematical thinking. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits voice expression to narration alone.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("moon swelled like a ripening fruit") and controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("vessels of forgotten kindnesses, encoded in curls and dashes"), though the perceptual signature of an artist noticing light and texture remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's cultured background ("thunderous veil," "historically oriented"), with selective perception focused on art and cultural preservation. The prose modulates effectively during action ("hands trembling slightly") versus reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent Gothic register with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("shadows that twisted time itself"). POV remains stable with Elias, and perceptual details like "whispered calculations under flickering lantern light" reflect his meticulous nature. The elevated diction occasionally strains but supports the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.0)
    The gothic register maintains consistency with phrases like "silk over rusted blades," though dialogue between Elias and the advisor lacks naturalistic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with controlled, literary register fitting a cartographer's precision: "spiral-shell cartographer," "calcified curves," "lexicon of history." POV remains stable with appropriate focalization. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the crack ("echoed like thunder"). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor register elevation in places ("pall of dread hung over it all") slightly exceeds natural thought.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register appropriate to the historian protagonist, with some effective moments ("ivy clung like whispered secrets"). However, the voice tends toward elevated abstraction ("emotionally rational pursuit had begun to clear the way for clarity") that distances rather than immerses, and lacks the distinct perceptual signature that would make Elias's perspective memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's role and sensibility—"forsaken coast," "brackish water," "spectral echoes"—with perceptual signature favoring architectural and archaeological detail. Free indirect style works cleanly ("After the drawbridge rises, the world below transforms, he thought").

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, with Elara's perceptual signature evident in how she processes the library through "meticulous grid of references."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's craft and emotional state, with controlled rhythm that mirrors his methodical work. Some passages achieve genuine beauty ("frozen prayers," "kaleidoscope of luminous agony").

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature of a physicist-survivor: equations whispered, perturbation theory applied to grief, technical vocabulary naturally integrated. Some register drift into elevated diction ("intangibly tangible force," "quantum foam") that occasionally strains the traumatized POV. Strong psychic distance control as Amir moves between technical focus and emotional breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "brilliant dimness" creating textural coherence. However, both characters speak in similar registers ("I seek the frequency of belonging" / "we'll navigate the trails"), lacking distinct idiom. The narrative voice occasionally drifts into explanatory mode that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though sometimes drifts toward elevated abstraction ("the ether of unspoken words"). POV remains stable, but perceptual signature could be more distinctive—Elias as forger doesn't sufficiently color his way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with selective access to Elias's thoughts. Voice shows distinct texture in phrases like "the furrowed hush of the night" and "recycled now into the wisdom." Some filter verbs ("felt," "knowing") could be stronger, but overall the prose maintains character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.9)
    The maritime-inflected voice maintains consistency with phrases like "backlash of regrets that now surged like rogue waves," though some passages drift into overwrought territory. The "merrily melancholic" tone is sustained but becomes repetitive, and the lack of dialogue removes opportunities for voice distinction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains a lyrical fantasy register with consistent elevated diction ("blossoms eternally unfurled," "veil of permanent moonlight"). However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—descriptions feel generic-literary rather than filtered through Elara's specific consciousness as a beast whisperer, and abstract phrases like "cosmic intimacy" appear repeatedly without earning their weight.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with controlled rhythm in passages like "where stars pierced the velvet sky like forgotten promises." The POV remains stable in close third.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "languid waltz" and "vibrant hush" that support the mystical tone.

Dialogue between Elias and Mira remains functional, and the perceptual signature focuses appropriately on light and texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, slightly elevated prose matching Elara's calm inventiveness. The "winking hush" tone successfully permeates the narrative through word choice and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistent dream-logic with phrases like "ghosts chasing forgotten dreams" and "waves whispered secrets," though occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("sacred geometries of waves and stars"). The perceptual signature stays distinct through Elara's curse-filtered awareness where futures haunt "like shadows in borrowed dawn."

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to a poet-protagonist, with controlled metaphorical density ("clouds boiled like an unquiet sea").

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the philosophical duelist character, with controlled syntax reflecting "scholarly poise." Focalization remains stable in third-person limited. Some phrases feel overwrought ("dignified chaos brewing within him"), but overall the prose texture supports characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive phrases like "vagrant penny poet" and "luminous fracture," and the free indirect style cleanly tracks Elias's transformation. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("skeletal remnant of knowledge"), but the perceptual signature remains specific to someone who sees poetry in decay.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "vine-woven platforms bobbed on invisible waves of ether" and controlled rhythm in "Reality shimmered; he was pulled through."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's perceptual signature shows in her scientific-mystical blend: "measuring the glow of enchanted blooms with calibrated lenses," seeing the ridge as "living tapestry." Voice maintains consistency through accumulative patterning of "luminous" and "empirically whimsical" that builds textural density. The dream sequence shifts psychic distance effectively, though some phrases like "dormant, a vast, slumbering entity" edge toward overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to Elias's slow-spoken nature, with phrases like "rhythmically placid" reflecting his measured worldview. The prose successfully modulates between external description and interiority.

    POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects Elara's perceptive nature. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon, even under pressure. The single line "as if the world itself doubted the wonders it was about to unveile" is a rare, slight POV slip into an omniscient register, but it's brief and does not harm closure.

    POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. Some minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("drowsy alertness" becomes a slightly repetitive motif), but elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is lush, consistent, and confidently metaphorical, matching the world’s fable-tech register. Dialogue is clean and purposeful, especially Thorne’s plainness against the lyric narration.

    The lyric third‑person close stays steady and character‑filtered, with a distinct lexicon (onyx ink, cloudcloth) that reflects Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates appropriately, tightening at the knot and quieting at the pool. A few purple-leaning constructions flirt with overreach but remain legible and purposeful.

    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a “spectral intelligence” POV; diction and rhythm reinforce the ghostly resolve. Psychic distance modulates cleanly during peak beats without head-hopping. Expository lines are integrated into action rather than standing apart.

    A steady, lyrical third-person with controlled distance; diction and rhythm suit the fable-realism. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Mira’s prophecy adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is highly consistent with the protagonist's intellectual and precise mindset, creating a strong perceptual signature. This control, however, occasionally slips into a more generic, explanatory register when articulating the story's theme directly, losing some specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the lyrical voice is consistent with the character of an artist. However, the perceptual signature could be more distinct; the voice sometimes feels like a generic "poetic narrator" rather than uniquely Elara's. While technically proficient, it lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would elevate it to a truly memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control. The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, employing a lyrical, elevated tone that suits the story's speculative and melancholic mood. Psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elara’s internal state during the climax without any technical missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is hampered by conspicuous repetition that feels like an authorial directive. The triple use of "inadvertently stubborn" and the recycling of "chased stillness" create an artificial texture. This tic disrupts the immersive, melancholic tone the piece otherwise works hard to establish, making the voice feel constructed rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that is consistent throughout. The prose rhythm and word choice effectively create a fable-like tone that suits the story's content. The single instance of dialogue is stylized as a formal declaration, which feels appropriate for the climactic moment, preserving the voice's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent and distinctive lyrical tone that aligns perfectly with the "foggy lucidity" concept. The point of view is controlled, filtering the mystical events through Elara's specific perceptions and history. The prose has a clear texture, but occasionally the syntax becomes slightly repetitive in its construction of complex, multi-clausal sentences, creating a cadence that feels more declarative than experiential in moments of high emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the story's speculative and introspective nature. The point of view is expertly controlled, maintaining a tight psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elias's internal struggle. The narrative prose has a distinct, memorable texture that carries the conceptual weight of the story without faltering.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and controlled, but the narrative voice is more authorial than character-bound. The prose has a consistent, elevated tone that often describes Elias's internal state with poetic distance ("grace of a falcon") rather than filtering perception through his specific, immediate experience. This creates a mythic quality but sacrifices the intimacy and perceptual signature of a more grounded POV.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly married to the protagonist's unique synesthetic perception. The narrative maintains a consistent and intimate psychic distance, filtering all sensory details through Elias's specific way of experiencing the world ("purples sighing like regrets, blues chiming with fragile hope"). This creates a prose texture that is both memorable and immersive, with no head-hopping or voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is lyrical and consistent, maintaining a tone of wonder and quiet intensity appropriate for the fantastical premise. The point of view is controlled, filtering all perception through Elara's specific worldview. However, the repetition of the key phrase "luminous disbelief" feels like a textual artifact rather than an organic return, slightly flattening the voice's texture and revealing the hand of the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is well-controlled and maintains a consistent psychic distance. The voice has moments of distinction, particularly in the quieter descriptions. However, the dialogue of his "dramatic narrations," while characterizing, can feel slightly overwrought and less like a genuine coping mechanism and more like a performance for the reader, which creates a minor inconsistency in the overall narrative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and consistency, and the narrative voice is functional for the genre. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with the rising tension. The voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, however, occasionally leaning on familiar phrasings ("shattering his identity like glass underfoot") rather than character-particular observation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that enhances the mythic, solemn tone. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and possesses a clear perceptual signature focused on silence, light, and texture. The prose rhythm and elevated diction are sustained flawlessly, creating a narrative voice that feels both ancient and immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The POV is consistent, and the narrative voice possesses a distinct, measured texture that befits a sentient machine on a philosophical quest. The prose has a specific rhythm and formality that feels intentional and effective. The primary weakness is a reliance on a limited lexicon for its core concepts, leading to repetition that slightly flattens the voice over the course of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical register. However, the prose's elevated tone can feel more authorial than character-specific, lacking a truly distinct perceptual signature for Elias. While technically clean, the voice doesn't fully modulate under pressure, maintaining a uniform poetic quality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like tone appropriate for the story. The point of view remains securely with Elias. The main limitation is the psychic distance; the summary-based structure creates a narrator who is reporting on events rather than a focalizer experiencing them, which dampens the story's immediacy and emotional impact, particularly during the central deception.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV on Elara is maintained with control and a consistent, literary voice. The narrative stance effectively modulates from intellectual curiosity to tension and finally to quiet reflection. The dialogue is functional but occasionally borders on being too direct, slightly thinning the subtext (e.g., "Anything for you, Doc.").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is lyrical, controlled, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the material perfectly. The POV is stable, and the prose has a distinct, memorable texture. Psychic distance remains appropriately close to Elias's artistic sensibilities. The story's commitment to a "wordless conversation" means dialogue is absent, a choice that powerfully reinforces both the tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice has a distinct, literary texture. However, the prose occasionally becomes overwrought, with a register that feels more authorial than character-specific ("a luminous veil of pale greens and purples that whispered of fleeting beauty and inevitable loss"). This elevated diction, while atmospheric, sometimes distances the reader from Elara's immediate internal experience by prioritizing poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice establishes a suitably reflective and weary tone. The primary issue is a tendency towards diagnostic narration that explains Alex's internal processes rather than fully embodying them. Sentences like "he appraised the scene through the radio's lens" and "By interpreting these frantic calls, he appraised the weight of his swallowed truth" create a psychic distance that feels more analytical than immediate, slightly flattening the emotional peak of his realization.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is controlled, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and slightly archaic tone that suits the mythic subject matter. The narrative distance is stable and effective for an archetypal figure, and the prose has a distinct perceptual signature focused on texture, silence, and decay. The voice is a primary driver of the story's success.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, creating a gentle, consistent voice that matches the story's tone. However, the narrative voice occasionally adopts the specific, slightly detached language of the prompt ("mellow," "softly adaptive"), which reads more like an external description of Elara than a true embodiment of her perceptual signature. This creates a minor but noticeable layer of distance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct, literary voice throughout. The prose has a specific texture and rhythm that reflects the solemn, scholarly nature of the protagonist and his world. There are no slips in focalization, and the narrative stance effectively modulates the story's quiet, anticipatory tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, perfectly suiting the story's fable-like quality. The third-person limited POV is controlled with precision, establishing a clear perceptual signature for Elias without a single slip in psychic distance or unearned knowledge, resulting in a seamless and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the story's elevated, solemn tone. The prose possesses a unique rhythm and texture, particularly in the chanted, looping phrases that form the core of the conflict. Point of view remains tightly controlled, effectively filtering the abstract, dimensional threat through the character's focused, ritualistic perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical register that suits the story's magical-realist tone and the protagonist's profession. The point of view is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on metaphor and time. The voice occasionally feels more authorial than character-driven in its poeticism, a fine line that slightly tempers its overall effect.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident and sustained, possessing a mythic, slightly formal quality that suits an ancient, weary protagonist. Point of view remains tightly focused, and the psychic distance is controlled effectively, drawing the reader into Elara's recursive despair and eventual release. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the magical events through a lens of profound exhaustion and determination.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, with a consistent and lyrical narrative voice that perfectly suits the story's melancholic tone. The psychic distance is well-calibrated, drawing the reader close to Elias's sensory world of vibration and silence. The prose possesses a distinct, memorable texture from the first sentence to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the voice—measured, meticulous, observant—is a perfect match for the character. The prose has a distinct and consistent texture. A minor weakness is a slight tendency to over-explain the character's nature (e.g., "not the reckless prying of fools, but a genuine, measured inquisitiveness"), which briefly pulls back into a more authorial register.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with skill, maintaining a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's melancholic mood. The narrative distance is well-controlled, though the voice momentarily shifts into a more explanatory register during the epiphany, slightly diluting the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece maintains a confident, distinct, and consistent third-person limited POV. The poetic voice is perfectly suited to the protagonist, and his perceptual signature—a focus on textures, patterns, and layers—is woven through the narration seamlessly. The prose rhythm and diction are controlled and modulate well with the rising tension, creating a fully immersive narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is lyrical, consistent, and perfectly suited to the story's tone. The prose possesses a distinct, elegant texture. While the character's perceptual signature is defined by his acoustic sensitivity, the overall voice could have benefited from a few more idiosyncratic ticks to fully separate the narrator's prose from the character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and masterfully sustains the specified "affectionate detachment" tone. The psychic distance is expertly calibrated for a character observing her own transcendence, with a consistent perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a generic literary narrator than a "shrewd seaside cargo broker." The voice converges when describing both characters with identical, somewhat clinical labels ("cautious exuberance," "whimsical attentiveness"), which weakens the sense of individual interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and maintains a distinct, fable-like tone that suits the material. The third-person POV remains stable and controlled. The primary weakness is the consistently distant psychic narration; we are often told what Lirah feels in summary, keeping the reader at an emotional arm's length rather than fully immersing them in her immediate, sensory experience of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a consistent and evocative third-person limited POV. The voice is lyrical and well-suited to the fantastical setting, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on natural forms and resonant sounds. The psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader close during moments of high tension without any unmotivated shifts or narrative leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, and the narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to a pensive, inventive conjurer. The prose has a specific rhythm and texture, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through Elias's unique lens of memory and mathematics. The control over psychic distance is excellent, drawing the reader close during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct narrative voice that perfectly matches the protagonist's gentle, methodical nature. The prose has a specific lyrical texture that is sustained from the opening sentence to the close. The voice is confident and purposeful, effectively drawing the reader into Elias's secluded world.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is mostly stable, with a lyrical voice well-suited to the character. A significant flaw occurs with the narrator's meta-commentary, "It was her circuitous sincerity at work...," which breaks psychic distance to explain the character's psychology directly to the reader. This moment of authorial intrusion momentarily disrupts the immersive quality of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and evocative voice, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to Elias's artistic, weary worldview. The prose has a deliberate, melancholic rhythm that fits the tone. The brief dialogue is purposeful, advancing the plot and revealing character without disrupting the narrative voice. Psychic distance is well-controlled, modulating effectively with the emotional intensity of the discovery and the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and clarity. The narrative voice, however, is somewhat distant and generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature that would make Elara's experience feel more personal and immediate. The prose often describes her transformation with the cool objectivity of a fable's narrator rather than fully inhabiting her flickering senses and chaotic insights during the change.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is elevated and consistent in its lyrical tone. The prose has a distinct, if somewhat overwrought, texture. The primary weakness is the repeated, verbatim use of the story's core conceptual language ("compile," "staggered intervals," "reactively visionary"), which makes the voice feel slightly artificial, as if constructed to fit a prompt rather than emerging organically from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the third-person limited POV is consistent, the narrative voice is severely undermined by lexical repetition. Phrases like "trembling certainty" and "analytically artistic" are used as recurring tics rather than organic expressions of a unique perspective. This mechanical repetition flattens the voice, making it feel programmatic and artificial rather than distinctive and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the lyrical voice is well-suited to the story's tone. The narrative maintains a controlled psychic distance effectively. The score is slightly limited by occasional authorial intrusions that summarize character traits or motivations ("Her motivation was simple yet profound"), momentarily pulling the reader out of Elara's direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is stable and the elevated, formal voice is tonally appropriate for an ancient immortal. The prose has a consistent texture. The main weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the voice feels more like a capable "literary" narrator than a specific, idiosyncratic character mind, leaning on abstraction over concrete, personal observation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and consistency. The narrative voice is distinct and literary, establishing a serious, contemplative tone that suits the material. However, the voice occasionally slips into overly abstract or thematic language ("equations of equity," "forged-yet-honest plea") that feels more like authorial summary than a character's immediate internal experience, creating a slight distance at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a unique texture that aligns with the protagonist's sensibilities as a stationer obsessed with texture itself. The close third-person POV is controlled, and the perceptual signature—focused on light, sound vibrations, and gilded surfaces—is strong and purposeful. The prose occasionally feels slightly overwrought, but the voice remains confident and specific to this character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The point of view is masterful, maintaining a consistent, close-third psychic distance that is essential to the story's effect. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature—the filtering of reality, the synesthetic bleeding of senses, the focus on "texture"—that is unique, controlled, and modulates effectively with the story's rhythm. This is a story where the voice *is* the central character element, and it is executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic, and slightly ornate tone that suits the story's philosophical aims. The point of view is stable and controlled. However, the voice's signature relies heavily on the repeated phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" and its variations, which becomes a stylistic crutch rather than a nuanced expression of character.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice is more functional than distinctive, often lapsing into abstract summary. The prose doesn't create a unique perceptual signature for Lanara; her thoughts and observations are conveyed in a competent but generic narrative register. The story lacks the fine-grained texture and rhythmic control that would elevate the voice to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's lyrical, melancholic tone. The prose has a distinct texture, though it occasionally drifts into a slightly detached, formal register that creates a small distance from Elena's immediate sensory experience. The focalization remains clean and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone that suits the story’s serene mood. The third-person POV is controlled and effective in focusing the action. The prose, however, sometimes feels more like a beautiful authorial summary than an embodied perspective, particularly in the opening character description ("drew wanderers like moths to a flame").

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable, and the narrative voice has moments of distinctiveness, particularly in the character’s wry asides. However, the voice is significantly hampered by the mechanical repetition of key descriptive phrases ("dry wit," "subtly confident"). This tic disrupts the prose rhythm and creates a sense of authorial scaffolding rather than an organic character voice modulating under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like tone appropriate for the material. The POV is stable and effectively filters the world through a detached, mythic lens. The primary weakness is the over-reliance on a small set of evocative but heavily repeated words and phrases ("wild hush," "cryptic," "ancient archway"), which creates a somewhat monotonous rhythm and limits the voice's texture and range.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct, elevated texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into an authorial register that feels slightly detached from a character experiencing mortal peril. Phrases like "accumulated quietude" or "captured transience," while thematically fitting, can read more like narrative summary than a character’s immediate, panicked perception.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece maintains a consistent and controlled authorial voice with a distinct, elevated rhythm. The POV is stable and the perceptual signature aligns with the character's quest, filtering details through his thematic lens. The primary weakness is that the highly stylized, literary voice feels relentless and occasionally artificial, sacrificing a degree of emotional authenticity for stylistic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct gothic voice. The psychic distance is well-controlled. The main weakness is a developing syntactic monotony; many sentences follow a similar rhythm and structure, which slightly dulls the prose's texture and momentum over the course of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a fairy-tale-like tone that suits the material. Point of view is stable within Elara, with a well-controlled psychic distance that shifts appropriately between her waking thoughts and the dreamlike trance of her work. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering the world through her poetic and reverent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and control, establishing a consistent, literary voice. Psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close during moments of discovery. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture, but the voice's articulation of Elara's internal state is occasionally more analytical than emotional, which creates a slight distance at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice has a distinct, literary texture that perfectly matches the story's tone. Elara’s perceptual signature—her focus on margins and overlooked details—is consistently and effectively rendered. The prose rhythm modulates well, capturing both the quiet contemplation and the underlying tension of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story's mythic quality, and the POV is flawlessly stable. The narrative demonstrates a clear perceptual signature, focusing on elements relevant to Elara's craft. The score is slightly tempered by occasional moments of narrative summary that explain motive or plot logic directly (e.g., "To unravel the conspiracies, she needed to hear those stories"), momentarily flattening the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a potent, otherworldly atmosphere. The point of view remains tightly controlled, filtering every perception through Elara's specific emotional state. The elevated, rhythmic prose works well for the mythological feel of the story, establishing a clear and memorable perceptual signature. While consistent, the lack of modulation in the elevated tone is a minor constraint preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the voice maintains a distinct lyrical, if occasionally overwrought, tone. Psychic distance is managed well, keeping the focus tight on Elena's perceptions, which are colored by the anesthetic. However, the authorial insertion of labels like "shrewdly innocent" creates small moments of voice leakage, telling the reader how to interpret the character rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, dreamlike distance appropriate for the story's frame. The POV is controlled and the perceptual signature feels distinct. The score is tempered by a few moments of authorial intrusion that break psychic distance, such as the explanatory line, "She was the vivid mural artist who paints with light, after all; it was her attribute, her gift..."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, suiting the fantastical, introspective nature of the story. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elara's internal transformation without any unmotivated shifts. The score is capped due to the prose issues identified in Q7; the overwriting is a feature of the voice itself, which, while consistent, lacks the precision and economy expected for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently held, and the narrative voice has a distinct, if somewhat florid, texture. The prose signature is established early and maintained. However, the dialogue is more functional than truly revelatory, serving primarily to deliver exposition or stylized pronouncements. The repetition of the phrase "candidly cryptic" acts as a slight authorial crutch rather than an organic element of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the fantastical, melancholic tone, maintaining a stable and controlled third-person POV. The prose has a distinct, elevated texture with a clear perceptual signature focused on sound, light, and shadow. However, the voice occasionally feels generic to its subgenre, relying on beautiful but familiar phrasing rather than forging a truly unique narrative consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the story's melancholic tone. The prose creates a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical setting through Elara's specific sorrow. The piece loses some points for a slightly monotonous register that maintains a high level of ornate description throughout, missing opportunities for rhythmic modulation to heighten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and effective, maintaining focus on Elara's internal state. The voice aims for an arcane, literary quality which is mostly successful. The primary flaw is the distracting repetition of the phrase "cautious exuberance" three times; this tic undermines the voice's distinctiveness, making it feel self-conscious and reliant on a label rather than embodying the quality through prose rhythm and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality. However, the prose often relies on pre-packaged, abstract descriptors ("resolved dualities," "dappled resolve") that feel more authorial than character-driven. This creates a psychic distance that keeps the reader observing Elias's journey rather than fully inhabiting his perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, melancholic tone. The prose is controlled and purposeful, modulating with Elias's emotional state. The voice, however, lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally feeling more like a generalized literary voice than one uniquely filtered through this specific character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and lyrical, perfectly matching the contemplative and melancholic tone. POV control is absolute, with a stable psychic distance that draws the reader into Elias's specific perceptual signature—a mind that seeks patterns in chaos. The prose rhythm and syntax effectively reflect his "featherly determined" spirit, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, contemplative tone that suits the deep-sea setting and Elara's solitary perspective. The point of view is controlled, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the intimate, internal journey. The prose has a specific texture, though it sometimes leans into a repetitive cadence of complex sentences. There are no major flaws, but the voice lacks the modulation that would heighten the tension during the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct, lyrical voice for Elara. Her perceptual signature, focused on ephemeral phenomena like foam and light, aligns perfectly with her role as a recollectionist. The prose maintains its poetic texture and rhythm throughout, modulating slightly with the emotional tone of her discoveries without any disruptive shifts in psychic distance or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, and the voice—cool, analytical, and slightly poetic—is a perfect match for Elias's character. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through his unique lens of seeing patterns in chaos. The brief dip into Mira's thoughts ("What serendipity, she thought") is handled deftly as a confirmation of Elias's successful orchestration rather than a true POV break, maintaining control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    The voice is the story's defining strength: a sustained, lyrical, and distinct third-person limited POV that perfectly matches the mystical subject matter. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, with a controlled rhythm that modulates effectively with the ritual's intensity. POV discipline is flawless, creating a seamless and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical and largely consistent, but it suffers from minor register drift. Phrases like "noctilucent reckonings" and "fleeting geometry" feel more like the narrator's elevated vocabulary than the authentic interiority of a harbor glazier, however reflective. This creates a slight distance and undermines the otherwise strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistent, but it reads as more authorial than character-driven. The highly literary, abstract narration ("celestial ballet," "velvet expanse," "bargained innocence") creates a register mismatch with the character of a rugged, scarred firefighter. The dialogue is less a conversation and more a polished, sermon-like monologue, lacking the naturalism of spoken language.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly suited to the "logical dreamer" character and "serene upheaval" tone. The elevated, somewhat detached prose establishes a unique perceptual signature. POV control is flawless, maintaining a stable psychic distance that reinforces the character's methodical and watchful nature without any slips or unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice is distinct. However, the prose occasionally slips into a more distant, authorial register, labeling the character's traits ("The sensitively perceptive cartographer...") from the outside rather than maintaining a close psychic distance. This creates minor, but noticeable, seams in the point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and maintains a distinct perceptual signature appropriate for an ethereal artist. The narrative distance is perfectly controlled. The prose rhythm supports the magical, incantatory nature of the events, creating a cohesive and immersive point of view throughout the single, focused scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and maintains an elevated, formal tone appropriate for the epic scope. The third-person limited POV is handled cleanly, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on ritual and atmosphere. The prose, while effective, occasionally uses familiar fantasy phrasing (“velvet expanse,” “ethereal forms”) that slightly dilutes the voice’s uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining an elevated, literary tone that suits the material. However, the psychic distance sometimes feels too analytical, with the narration offering diagnostic summaries of Elias's psychology ("funneled fortunes...to launder his image"). This creates a voice that explains the character's inner state with a clarity he might not possess mid-crisis, slightly distancing the reader from his immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that serves the story's fairy-tale quality. However, its distinctiveness is weakened by a heavy reliance on recycling a few key phrases ("alarming serenity," "bodily poetic"). This repetition, while thematic, sometimes flattens the voice's texture and makes it feel more like an engineered response than an organic narrative consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control, and the voice has a distinct, literary texture. However, the prose's elevated register is so consistent that it occasionally feels uniform, blurring the line between Elias's internal state and the narrator's style. While effective in creating a specific mood, the voice lacks modulation under pressure and leans on a recurring set of lyrical-but-lofty phrases ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies") that slightly flatten its dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the story's contemplative nature. The point of view is controlled with no lapses. The prose has a clear rhythmic quality, but its polysyllabic and abstract diction ("esoteric realist," "spectral narratives," "esoteric imbalances") at times creates a distance, feeling more like a philosophical narrator's voice than the immediate, unfiltered thoughts of the character within the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the mythic tone of the piece, and the point of view is stable and effective. Its primary weakness is a slight mechanical feeling, stemming from the noticeable repetition of provided keywords. This can make the prose feel constructed to fit requirements rather than flowing organically from the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story maintains a consistent and distinctive voice, successfully creating the "ethereal grit" tone through its syntax and diction. The POV is stable and controlled. The primary weakness is the recycling of key phrases ("ethereal grit," "precisely playful"), which begins to feel like a tic that flattens the voice rather than deepens it, momentarily breaking the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, and the elevated, formal voice is appropriate for an astronomer. However, the narrative voice is so heavily saturated with the story's keywords (ironic, frugal, dusky, harmonious, encrypted) that it feels more like an exercise in thematic density than a distinct, character-particular perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical consistency. The voice has a stable, elevated tone fitting the fantastical setting. However, it relies heavily on abstract and conceptual language, creating a narrative distance that keeps the reader from fully experiencing the characters' internal, emotional transformations.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the elevated, lyrical voice is consistent and well-suited to the story's magical realist tone. The narrative distance is controlled effectively, keeping the focus tight on the character's perceptions and actions. The voice is distinct, though its effectiveness is somewhat hampered by the prose's density.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and consistency, providing a clear window into Elias's grief-tinged determination. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical texture that suits the fable-like quality of the story. Dialogue is sparse but effective, differentiating Elias's feisty grumbling from Lila's earnest concern. The prose rhythm modulates well with the rising and falling tension of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance appropriate for the contemplative, philosophical tone. The narrative voice is distinct, with a slightly elevated and formal register that suits the cosmic setting. While the dialogue from the mirror is necessarily expository, the prose maintains its unique perceptual signature, filtering the impossible events through Elias’s specific, bewildered-yet-driven consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a distinct, lyrical voice that suits the arcane setting. The narrative distance is well-controlled, and the perceptual signature is clear through the "symphony" metaphor. The sparse dialogue is functional, though Thorne's lines lean toward the archetypal. The prose rhythm and elevated diction are sustained effectively throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, appropriate tone for a modern fable. However, the POV's perceptual signature is weakened by its reliance on the story's abstract key terms. This makes the narration feel less like a unique character's filter on the world and more like an authorial construct articulating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice often defaults to summary and abstraction ("The room's complexity unfolded clearly in her mind"), distancing the reader from Elara's immediate sensory experience. This tendency to narrate understanding rather than dramatize the process of discovery keeps the voice functional but prevents it from developing a truly distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and maintains a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the mythic subject matter. The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elara's sensory experience and internal state. The prose has a distinct rhythmic quality, and the narrative distance modulates effectively, drawing closer during the intense focus of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable, and the voice maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical tone that fits the mythic quality of the story. The prose has a distinct texture, using recurring motifs like "thistle-blown hope" effectively. The narrative distance remains controlled, focusing on Elara's perceptions, though it occasionally slips into summarizing her emotional state rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece establishes a distinct, elevated, and lyrical voice that is consistent throughout. However, the reliance on recycling key phrases ("deepening hush," "preemptively nostalgic") creates a noticeable template cadence that slightly undermines the voice's unique texture and control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the story's fable-like nature. The character’s perceptual signature is clear; as a fireworks designer, he is attuned to light, pattern, and atmosphere. The use of the chants as a recurring vocal tic effectively externalizes his internal state and its transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The point of view is controlled and the voice is distinct and lyrical, establishing a clear perceptual signature for Kael. The primary weakness is a recurring tendency for the narrative voice to adopt a slightly too-academic register when describing its own processes. Phrases like "symbolizing rebirth in old lore" or "foresee outcomes through oblique reflections" feel more expository than personal, creating a minor but consistent psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical voice and a controlled third-person POV. The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the fantastical world through Elara's specific dread and yearning. The prose is slightly weakened by repetitive syntactic patterns, such as the parallel "To cultivate it..." and "To collect them..." constructions, which feel like narrative scaffolding rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a lyrical, elevated voice that perfectly matches the fantastical setting. Elias's perceptual signature is distinct, focused on sound, silence, and the vial's contents. The minimal dialogue is purposeful, with each line serving to either reveal character or advance the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, creating a cohesive, elevated tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm that supports the high-concept fantasy/sci-fi blend. While the voice is skillfully executed and free of technical errors, it lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it from highly competent to memorable and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person narrative voice is lyrical and controlled, establishing a distinct and effective tone. However, the dialogue is stilted and artificial, serving as a delivery mechanism for plot and theme rather than sounding like authentic speech. This stark contrast between the elegant narration and the unnatural dialogue creates a significant fissure in the story's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent tone, blending high-concept terminology with lyrical descriptions of the "shadowseam wonder." The point of view remains tightly focused on Elara, with her perceptions shaping the sensory details of the world effectively. While the prose is controlled, the voice sometimes feels more aligned with the conceptual premise than with the specific, embodied experience of a "broken" survivor, creating a slight distance between the character's stated history and her composed internal narration under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the gothic setting. The voice is weakened by a reliance on abstract, ornate phrasing that can feel unnatural ("spanned the chasm to enlightenment").

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone, which suits the fantastical setting. The point of view remains stable and controlled. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation and a reliance on recurring phrases ("shivering bliss," "endless night"), which gives the voice a slightly mechanical, incantatory feel at the expense of a more particular and dynamic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a consistent and intimate narrative distance. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature, defined by phrases like "tactfully hopeful" and "examined unknown," which lend a unique, contemplative texture to the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is well-controlled, and the narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent lexical and rhythmic signature. This voice effectively establishes the story's fairy-tale tone. The main limitation is a lack of modulation; the voice remains in the same high-lyrical register throughout, even during the climactic discovery, which slightly flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice has a lyrical quality suited to the material. Psychic distance is managed well, keeping the focus tightly on Elias's experience. The primary weakness is a slight tendency for the narration to explain the character's internal state with abstract labels rather than letting it emerge solely from perception and action, slightly blurring the line between character voice and authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the character and genre. The point of view is stable and controlled.

    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and maintains a controlled lyrical tone throughout. The point of view is stable, and the perceptual signature is strong, focusing on light and sound in character-specific ways.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elara's hyper-aware, pain-filled state.

    The narrative voice is lyrical, controlled, and maintains a consistent tone appropriate for the fantastical setting. The POV is stable, and the prose has a distinct, dreamlike texture. While generally strong, the voice occasionally relies on familiar genre phrasing ("eyes like polished obsidian," "nodded knowingly") that prevents it from feeling entirely singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent and clear. The psychic distance is well-controlled, shifting appropriately as Elias moves from professional observation to supernatural engagement. The prose, while functional, lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature or rhythm that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story's voice is its most striking feature: a sustained, lyrical, and highly distinct narrative stance that perfectly matches the fantastical setting and the protagonist's ancient perspective. The point of view is flawlessly maintained with a strong, consistent perceptual signature. The only minor shortcoming is a lack of dynamic modulation; the elevated tone remains constant even during the chaotic climax, sacrificing some potential rhythmic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, fitting the "poetically inclined" protagonist. The elevated, melancholic tone is a significant strength and carries the story's atmosphere effectively. The point of view is stable with a well-controlled psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice has a lyrical quality, but it is hampered by a recurring register mismatch. Abstract, academic-sounding phrases ("scaffold complexity," "timewoven alliances," "layered meanings") feel imposed on the character rather than arising from her specific perspective as a sculptor in a storm. This creates a distance between the voice and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece maintains a consistent and distinctive voice with a lyrical, elevated tone that suits the contemplative subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with perfect consistency, and the formal, slightly distant voice is appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature. It reports Elias’s thoughts and feelings cleanly but rarely filters the world through a unique, character-specific lens, leaning more on archetypal description than individual perception.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and well-suited to a "venerable oath scribe," maintaining a slightly formal, lyrical tone throughout. Psychic distance is expertly controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elias's perceptions and internal state without leakage. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through his unique obsessions with language and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the mythic subject matter. The point of view is expertly controlled. The score is significantly impacted by the heavy repetition of specific phrases ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity"), which begins to feel like a stylistic tic rather than an organic element of the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and clarity. The narrative voice is controlled and fits the quiet, contemplative tone of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's tone. However, the psychic distance occasionally wavers, with phrases like "The tone of the evening was one of mute eloquence" reading as authorial summary rather than Elias's direct perception. This creates a slight barrier between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, slightly ethereal tone appropriate for the premise. The point of view is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on the sensory "texture" of time.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice has a distinct lyrical and serene quality that matches the story's tone. The psychic distance is stable and effective for the meditative narrative. The prose serves the story's aims well, creating a palpable atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control, establishing a distinct and consistent narrative voice for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. However, the prose's high register and self-aware figurative language ("tinted revelation hinting at hidden truths viewed through the lens of memory's haze") create a distance, feeling more like a controlling authorial voice than an authentic representation of a scavenger's internal world. This creates a slight but persistent mismatch between character and narration.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature for Elara. The voice is lyrical and introspective, perfectly matching the story's contemplative tone and modulating effectively as her internal state shifts from confusion to purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    The point of view is consistent, and the voice maintains a distinct, mythic tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the narrative voice is hampered by a limited and repetitive lexicon of abstract concepts ("wonder," "sacredly playful," "cautious abandon") that are used as a crutch. The single line of dialogue is stiff and expository, serving only to state the theme, which flattens the character interaction at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated literary tone. However, the psychic distance remains somewhat remote, creating a narrative that often tells us of Alex's state through abstract labels ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless drive") rather than filtering the world through his specific, embodied perceptions. This stylistic choice sacrifices some immediacy and grounds the story more in concept than in character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and lyrical without sacrificing clarity. POV is flawlessly maintained, filtering all perception through Elara's evolving state of mind—from the dim melancholy of the opening to the "newfound clarity" of the close.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, literary, and slightly formal tone that fits the character of a chess tutor. The narrative stance of "fierce repose" is well-supported by the prose's measured rhythm. The psychic distance feels appropriate for a character engaged in deep internal reflection. While the voice is distinct, it lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally using common literary constructions rather than a more idiosyncratic filter.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and possesses a distinct poetic texture that aligns perfectly with the protagonist's character as an artist of words. The point of view is expertly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct, elevated voice that perfectly matches the "dire enchantment" tone.

    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical quality that suits the painter protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct lyrical quality. However, it frequently slips into overwrought melodrama, with phrases like "screamed in silence, tender as a lover's plea."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is lyrical, distinctive, and confidently maintained from start to finish, establishing a consistent and memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the narrative voice is consistent and lyrical. The prose establishes a distinct, melancholic texture. However, the repeated use of certain phrases, most notably "softly persistent" three times, feels more like a stylistic tic or a response to a constraint than an organic element of the voice, creating a subtle sense of artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, creating a voice that feels appropriate for a thoughtful, solitary character. The prose has a distinct, slightly formal rhythm that enhances the story's fable-like quality. The perceptual signature, focusing on the details of maps, relics, and natural patterns, is strong and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical quality appropriate for the fantasy genre. However, the voice is hampered by repetitive phrasing. The recurrence of "softly commanding" and "lacy menace" becomes a noticeable tic that flattens the prose rather than deepens the character or atmosphere. This repetition creates a slightly mechanical feel that undermines the otherwise controlled narrative distance and perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is highly distinct and consistent, establishing a specific poetic and conceptual texture. The POV is cleanly maintained. The primary weakness lies in the dialogue, where Elara's final lines ("I've captured the density of this presence") sound more like an authorial explanation of the story's mechanics than natural speech, momentarily flattening the character's voice into the narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, literary tone that suits the introspective nature of the story. The prose has a strong rhythm and perceptual signature.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story's quiet, reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill. The narrative voice possesses a distinct lyrical quality that fits the fantasy setting and Elara's scholarly nature, establishing a clear perceptual signature focused on sensory detail and internal somatic experience. The prose rhythm and texture remain controlled and evocative, even under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is atmospheric and consistent, but a significant POV break damages its integrity. The line "Elara, ever the advisor through metaphors, continued," is a jarring authorial intrusion that explains a character trait rather than allowing it to emerge through action. This slip, combined with dialogue that occasionally feels more like thematic articulation than genuine speech, creates an unwelcome distance from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly suited to the character—intellectual, precise, yet tinged with a yearning for something beyond her equations.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that fits the story's melancholic mood.

    The voice is lyrical and consistent, maintaining a melancholic and reverent tone that suits the material.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, with a lyrical and introspective tone that suits the story's speculative nature. The point of view is stable and effectively filters the bizarre environment through Elara’s perception. However, the voice occasionally leans on abstract jargon like "symphony of contingencies" which feels more like an authorial concept than a natural part of the character's internal language, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, creating a consistent lyrical and melancholic voice that suits the story.

The prose has a distinct rhythm, though a few phrases lean towards the generic ("ethereal light").

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Point of view is stable and technically proficient. However, the narrative voice feels more authorial than character-specific, employing an elevated, poetic register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains an effective psychic distance. The narrative voice is lyrical and atmospheric, but it is significantly hampered by repetitive key phrases. The awkward adverbial construction "spiralingly calm," used three times, reads as a distracting authorial tic rather than an authentic part of the character's perceptual signature, preventing the voice from achieving a higher tier of quality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, ethereal tone that suits the story's magical realism. The point of view is stable and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, and the narrative voice is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone. However, it reads as more authorial than character-driven, lacking a truly particular perceptual signature beyond a generic "poetic" sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct literary voice. The narrative stance is effective, but the prose occasionally leans on abstract labels ("bartered awakenings," "subtle demand") that create a slight distance from the character's immediate, embodied experience. The voice is strong but not fully seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the material. The narrative has a clear perceptual signature focused on light and sound. The primary weakness is a lack of distinctiveness; the prose, while pretty, feels somewhat generic in its lyricism, and the repetition of key descriptors ("powerfully gentle") reads as a tic rather than a deliberate vocal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)

The prose texture is distinct, though the repeated phrase "softly deliberate" slightly flattens the voice, reading more as a narrative instruction than an organic character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct lyrical quality that aligns with the story's tone.

    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct and atmospheric. The prose maintains a consistent, slightly elevated tone that suits the magical elements of the story. The primary weakness is the dialogue from the plants ("Dig deeper, seeker"), which feels clichéd and momentarily breaks the carefully crafted voice with generic fantasy phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that is consistent throughout. Elara's perceptual signature is clear, filtering all details through her mystical quest. The prose is controlled, though the singular, elevated register leaves little room for modulation in response to rising internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece maintains a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice, with a controlled psychic distance appropriate for the introspective narrative. The prose has a clear texture, and the narrator's way of seeing the world is filtered through a cosmic, poetic lens. However, the voice is so consistently elevated that it lacks some modulation, reading as a single, sustained note of "shadowed rapture" rather than a voice that shifts subtly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone that perfectly matches the story's atmosphere. The point of view is stable and controlled. A minor deduction is for a few instances where phrasing becomes slightly self-conscious or clunky, such as "he methoded his enchantment," which momentarily breaks the otherwise seamless and immersive prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical voice and a stable third-person limited POV that suits its philosophical, mythic tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the unique world through Elias's questing consciousness. The narrative distance is well-controlled, modulating effectively to convey both broader concepts and intimate moments of insight without any slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.3)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a lyrical, elevated voice appropriate for the allegorical tone. The narrative prose has a distinct and beautiful rhythm. The sparse, stylized dialogue of the guides fits their archetypal role perfectly, enhancing the mythic quality without a single misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality. However, the psychic distance sometimes feels too great, adopting an analytical register ("seraphically mundane," "conceptual repricing"-style thoughts) that can feel imposed upon the character rather than emanating from him. While the prose is controlled, this slight mismatch between the character's state and the narration's articulation holds it back.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece establishes a consistent, elevated, and mythic voice appropriate for its subject matter. The POV remains tightly controlled, and the narrative stance is confident. However, the voice lacks modulation; its stately, formal register is maintained even at the peak of the climax, missing an opportunity to reflect the escalating tension through shifts in rhythm or syntax. This results in a voice that is distinctive but somewhat monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The point of view is confident and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the melancholic, focused tone. Elara's perceptual signature is clear, filtering the world through her scientific and solitary lens. The prose rhythm effectively mirrors her pensive state, modulating well during the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a controlled psychic distance. However, the narrative voice has a generic, elevated lyricism that feels more authorial than character-specific. The prose is tonally consistent but lacks a unique perceptual signature, meaning Elara’s internal world is described in a voice that could belong to almost any poetic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly and consistently. The narrative voice is functional and establishes a mythic tone suitable for the story. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the prose feels competent but somewhat generic, relying on familiar phrasings ("curled like forgotten dreams," "popped like secrets surfacing") rather than a unique, character-specific way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a lyrical and intimate voice that suits the story's reflective nature. The prose has a distinct, melancholic rhythm, and the character's perception feels specific. However, the voice occasionally slips into slightly overwrought or clichéd phrasing ("joy turned to ash," "abyss of grief"), which momentarily dilutes its unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice has a distinct, elevated texture. However, the voice's primary signature becomes the overuse of rhetorical questions, a device that feels less like a character-specific tic and more like an authorial intrusion for thematic exposition. This flattens the voice's potential for nuance and creates a repetitive pattern that slightly distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, keeping the focus tightly on Elowen's internal state and perceptions. The voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly elevated rhythm that suits the quasi-mythic tone of the story. There are no notable slips in psychic distance or unmotivated shifts in register until the final clinical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice is compromised by excessive repetition of specific, provided keywords ("dizzying quiet," "bravely conflicted," "scandalize"). This verbal tic creates a mechanical, prompt-driven feel that undermines the development of a unique perceptual signature. The voice feels less like a distinct character's and more like an instrument for fulfilling a checklist, which significantly flattens its texture.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the lyrical voice aligns with the story's tone. The prose has a distinct texture, but it leans heavily on the story’s bespoke jargon ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze"). This creates a voice that feels slightly constructed around the premise rather than emerging as a unique and authentic perceptual signature of the character herself.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    The piece establishes a distinct and consistent lyrical voice from the first sentence, maintaining a controlled, elevated tone that perfectly suits its fantastical premise. The point of view is expertly handled, with a strong perceptual signature that filters all details through the fisher's unique worldview. The prose rhythm and syntax effectively modulate the story's dreamlike atmosphere and Eron's calm focus amidst chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits Elara’s observant and analytical character. The voice is distinct, with a literary and slightly formal rhythm that feels authentic to the heiress in her isolated sanctuary. The prose effectively mirrors her internal state, shifting from reflection to decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is stable, and the narrative voice has a distinct, poetic texture ("meteor hush"). However, this voice is compromised by its own density. The prose is so consistently elevated and figurative that it creates a somewhat uniform, breathy tone that doesn't modulate enough with the rising tension. This stylistic choice, while consistent, occasionally keeps the reader at a distance from the raw emotion of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct, with a lyrical and slightly elevated tone that fits the "whimsical chalk artist" character. Elara's "socially perceptive" nature provides a consistent and specific filter for her observations, creating a clear perceptual signature. The prose is controlled and maintains its texture even as the emotional intensity rises, demonstrating strong command of the chosen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is hampered by a reliance on abstract, repeated compound phrases ("gentle radical," "warm coldness," "retrocognitively trapped"). This creates a somewhat generic, template-like texture that lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a conceptual summary than a character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the use of synesthesia creates a distinct and memorable perceptual signature for Elara. The narrative voice is lyrical and consistent, effectively modulating between despair and wonder. Silas's theatrical dialogue provides a clear contrast, and there is no leakage or head-hopping, resulting in a polished and immersive perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Alex's artistic and skeptical nature. The voice is lyrical and specific. There is a minor tendency for the prose's elevated register to feel more authorial than character-driven, particularly in its complex figurative language during moments of stress.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative voice aligns with Elara's scientific, observant character. The prose is clean and controlled, though the heavy reliance on technical and psychological jargon at times makes the voice feel more explanatory than personal. This slightly academic register creates a distance that mutes some of the potential emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece maintains a consistent and distinctive voice, blending a sense of ancient reverence with quiet determination. The POV remains tightly focused on Eland, and his perceptions shape the narrative's lyrical, measured rhythm. Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, drawing in close during the cataloging process and pulling back for the final, expansive image of the saved cliffs.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with professional control and the narrative voice is consistent with the genre. The tone is well-established, though it occasionally relies on familiar spy-thriller phrasing ("tapestry of shadows," "shadowed career"). Dialogue is purposeful but lacks deep subtext, sometimes serving to state thematic points directly rather than revealing character through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice feels constructed and inconsistent. It oscillates between evocative, poetic language ("clung like a shroud") and abstract, clinical jargon ("ambient awareness," "percolate"). This register drift creates an artificial texture that distances the reader from a truly embodied perspective, reading more like an authorial explanation of a character's process than the process itself.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyrical voice that aligns well with the protagonist's contemplative nature. The prose maintains a specific perceptual signature, focusing on texture, light, and pattern, which feels authentic to a potter. The narrative distance is managed effectively, modulating slightly during the climax without losing coherence or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and lyrical voice that matches the story's ethereal tone. Elara’s perceptual signature is clear, focused on light, shadow, and delicate details. The narrative distance feels slightly too wide at times, describing her internal state with abstract labels ("wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability") that feel more analytical than experiential, briefly thinning the otherwise immersive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the ethereal setting. The narrative distance is well-controlled, modulating effectively during the climactic ritual. Elara's perceptual signature, focused on memory and resonance, feels distinct and appropriate for her character.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the lyrical, whimsical voice is distinct and consistent with the protagonist's character. The narrative stance is effective in building the story's unique atmosphere. The voice's primary vulnerability is a tendency to articulate emotional states with a slightly detached, poetic precision, occasionally distancing the reader from the immediacy of Elias's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with flawless control, establishing a distinct and compelling narrative voice that blends academic precision with a sense of weary wonder. The prose rhythm and diction shift appropriately with the rising tension, creating a strong perceptual signature for the protagonist. The narrative skillfully conveys Elara's expertise and emotional state without resorting to exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. However, this texture is marred by the repetition of key phrases like "wistful rebellion" and "spatial mutiny," which feel like authorial labels imposed on the character's thoughts. The prose signature is strong but lacks the subtlety and variation needed to feel like a truly organic internal voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice has a literary quality. However, the prose sometimes drifts into an overly abstract or authorial register that feels disconnected from the character's immediate experience. The repeated, self-conscious use of words like "lance" and "unify opposites" feels more like thematic signposting than a natural part of the character's internal monologue or the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a distinct and controlled narrative voice. The prose has a specific, somewhat formal texture that fits the character. The voice is significantly marred by the repetitive use of key phrases like "nervously confident" and "spongey dread," which become stylistic crutches rather than reinforcing motifs, creating a sense of mechanical prose rather than an organic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent in its poetic, melancholic register, and the single POV is handled cleanly. However, the prose is often overwrought, with a high density of abstract, conceptual language that can feel more authorial than character-driven. Phrases like "luminous disbelief of worlds overlapping" or "symphonies of what could be" create a voice that seems detached from the "weathered" fiddler it purports to represent.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a distinct, literary voice. Psychic distance is stable and effective. However, the narrative voice occasionally leans on repeating key phrases like "perceptively calm" or "dusky harmony," which can feel more like authorial labels than a fully organic perceptual signature emerging from the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. While pleasant, the prose feels somewhat generic, adhering to a conventional "poetic" style without revealing a unique, character-specific way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice possesses a distinct and consistent texture. The prose's formal, almost mythic rhythm and diction effectively embody Elowen's "warlike serenity." The narrative maintains a stable psychic distance that modulates appropriately with the rising action without any slips or unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person POV is maintained with control, but the narrative voice feels somewhat distant and overly formal for such an internal, visceral experience. Phrases like "unintended symbiosis" and "enigmatic geometry" create a register that can feel more like an academic narrator observing Elara than Elara's own perception. This psychic distance slightly mutes the emotional immediacy of her ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone. Dialogue is sparse and effective, distinguishing the characters well. The voice, however, leans on a handful of recurring phrases ("dusky resolve," "half-lit corridors," "fiercely gentle") that, while tonally consistent, create a slight sense of mechanical repetition rather than a fully organic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct narrative voice that captures Jack's world-weariness and expertise. The prose effectively modulates with his emotional state, particularly during the object's discovery. The only slip is in the final beat of realization, where the voice momentarily shifts from lived-in interiority to a more detached, explanatory register that slightly undermines the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a distinct narrative voice that is contemplative and precise. The prose rhythm reflects Elias's methodical nature. The voice is effective in its construction, but its tendency to use abstract, analytical language ("quantum fluxes," "elegant equations of transition") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate emotional experience, making the narration feel slightly more academic than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly suited to the story's elegiac tone. The prose maintains a controlled, lyrical quality that reflects the librarian's serene nature. POV is stable, and the psychic distance is expertly managed to create an atmosphere of ancient duty. The piece demonstrates a strong perceptual signature, with the world described through the lens of a timeless, mechanical guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice, while clean, lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The story's most significant flaw in this category is the moment of narrative self-correction regarding the crowning action. This intrusion breaks psychic distance, making the narrator feel less like a confident storyteller and more like an author figuring things out on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the story's aims. The POV is controlled and effective. The primary weakness is a narrative tendency to explain the symbolic weight of objects and moments, such as stating the accordion's patches "symbolized Elias's own fractured spirit," which slightly undermines the trust in the reader and the power of the image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story maintains a consistent, elevated voice and a stable third-person POV that suit its mythic tone. The narrator's perceptual signature is coherent. The prose, however, relies on a somewhat limited palette of ethereal adjectives and abstract nouns, which occasionally makes the voice feel more like a genre convention than a uniquely individual perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the story's mood. POV control is flawless, and the prose has a unique perceptual signature. Minor deductions are for a slight monotony in the lyrical register and the repetitive use of key phrases ("velvet," "mulberry"), which occasionally feels self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, perfectly matching the story's tone and otherworldly setting. The close third-person POV is controlled, giving intimate access to Elara's perceptions and process without any unmotivated shifts. The prose's rhythmic and lexical choices create a powerful, immersive perceptual signature for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's serene tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature or rhythmic variety, reading as competently executed but somewhat generic. The prose serves the story but doesn't elevate it with unique character-specific texture or phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV on Elias is controlled and consistent, effectively filtering the scene through his professional yet fragile perspective. The narrative voice is steady and maintains a consistent distance. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, directly advancing the plot and revealing character, particularly in Mara’s vulnerable plea.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person POV on Elara is controlled and consistent, maintaining a distinct, mystical voice. The prose has a specific texture, but it leans on repetitive phrasing ("sycamore hush," "weaves truth carefully") that, while thematic, begins to feel like a stylistic tic rather than an organic part of the voice. The narrative stance is solid, but lacks the syntactic variety and freshness required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is masterful in its consistency, maintaining an elevated, mythic tone that perfectly suits the story's epic-in-miniature scope. The point of view is stable and the skimmer's perceptual signature is specific to his role, focusing on sound, stone, and pattern. The narrative distance feels slightly too great at times, describing the skimmer's state with an omniscient quality rather than fully inhabiting his perspective, but this is a minor critique of an otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the material. The point of view is expertly controlled. The prose rhythm, however, remains uniformly lush even during moments of tension, missing an opportunity to modulate the cadence to heighten the sense of risk during the mist walk.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and perfectly suited to the story's magical-realist tone. Point of view is tightly controlled, with a clear perceptual signature focused on sound and light that reinforces the central motivation.

There are no technical slips in POV or narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a tone of solemn wonder. The tight third-person POV effectively filters the cosmic scale through Elara’s specific, ritual-focused perceptions. The score is held back slightly by the repetitive use of key phrases like "quietly enthusiastic" and "wavelength align," which occasionally feel more like thematic labels than organic parts of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The point of view is consistent, and the elevated, melancholic voice is tonally appropriate for an ancient being. The narrative prose maintains a consistent rhythm and texture. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the voice feels more like a well-executed style than the idiosyncratic internal world of a specific character, with phrases like "distant intimacy" reading as imposed concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice maintains a stable, elevated tone suitable for the genre. The prose has a deliberate, somewhat formal rhythm that fits the ritualistic scene. While competent and controlled, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, adhering closely to established fantasy conventions rather than carving its own unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature particular to a levee warden. The prose is elegant and controlled, but the lexicon ("unyielding precision," "expunging," "mirrored hush") feels more like a high literary narrator's voice than Elias's own internal texture. The voice is consistent and effective, but not deeply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited point of view is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the high-fantasy tone.

The prose rhythm modulates well, slowing for reflection and quickening during the climactic ritual, demonstrating strong control over narrative distance and pace.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a serious, almost mythic tone that suits the high-stakes scenario. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving from the weight of her burden to the sharp focus of problem-solving. While the voice is effective, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally feeling more like a formal narration of a hero's actions than a deep dive into a unique mind under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, elevated tone appropriate for the setting. POV is tightly controlled. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature; it feels more like a capable genre narrator than the specific, idiosyncratic mind of an "ego death survivor." The dialogue is functional but serves mainly as exposition for the conflict's terms.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the prose has a distinct, contemplative texture that fits the character. The narrative voice, however, is hampered by the mechanical repetition of specific keywords from the prompt. This creates a slightly artificial cadence and makes the voice feel less unique and more like an execution of a formula, particularly when using a term like "orthogonally" multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, and the narrative voice possesses a distinct and consistent lyrical texture that elevates the fantastical premise. The prose rhythm and elevated diction ("symphonic rebellion," "macerate") create a coherent perceptual signature for Elias's spectral consciousness. The voice modulates effectively from wistful memory to mournful purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and slightly distant third-person voice that befits the ancient, scholarly nature of the guardian. The prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature. The only minor friction is the slight tension between the "feral" descriptor and the highly philosophical, polished nature of the interiority, which could have been textured with more instinctual or non-verbal sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is stable and the voice generally maintains a fittingly elevated tone, but it is significantly marred by the jarring idiom "when the penny drops" at the story's climax, a register break that shatters the established atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent and effective tone of "fantasy practicality." The point of view is stable and the perceptual signature is generally distinct. The score is slightly limited by moments where interiority shifts from a character's specific thought process to a more generalized thematic summary, momentarily flattening the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently. The narrative voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a more generic, abstract register ("ferried fragments of lives across unseen boundaries"). The prose serves the plot but doesn't feel uniquely filtered through this specific character's mind or experience, reading more like an omniscient summary at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The point of view is confident and maintains a consistent psychic distance, creating a voice that is both methodical and infused with a sense of wonder.

The prose has a clear, controlled rhythm that supports the "unsettling calm."

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical, and slightly formal texture that perfectly matches the "somber marvel" tone.

The prose rhythm supports the story's contemplative pace, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. However, the repeated use of key phrases—"reeling hush" (five times) and "vulnerable voice" (four times)—becomes a noticeable prose artifact. While intended to create a motif, the frequency crosses into a repetitive tic that slightly flattens the voice and diminishes the impact of otherwise strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with flawless control and consistency. The narrative voice is atmospheric and purposeful, effectively conveying Alex's tension and the eerie environment. The prose has a clear perceptual signature tied to Alex's experience as a spelunker under stress. While highly competent and effective, the voice lacks a truly unique or surprising verbal texture that would elevate it into the highest tier of distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, lyrical voice that suits the story's contemplative tone. The prose has a specific texture, and the psychic distance is managed effectively, drawing in close for the ritual and pulling back for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is lyrical, elevated, and remarkably consistent, perfectly matching the mythic, solemn tone of the narrative. The third-person POV remains tightly focused on the storyteller, and his perceptual signature—a focus on texture and sound—is woven into the prose itself. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, creating a sense of an ancient tale being recounted. While there is no dialogue, the narrative voice itself is distinct and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical quality appropriate for the magical realism tone. The prose effectively conveys Elara’s internal state through its descriptions ("frostbitten hope"). The primary weakness is a slight reliance on narrative summary during peak emotional moments, which distances the reader from the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that suits the story's fairy-tale quality.

The prose signature is distinct and supports the tone without any unmotivated shifts in register.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical competence, and the narrative voice is tonally consistent. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic literary sci-fi style. Its effectiveness is further diluted by carrying the burden of the story's repetitive thematic declarations, which flattens its individuality and makes it feel less character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and consistency, establishing a distinct and fittingly lyrical voice for a silent protagonist. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, modulating effectively as Elias moves deeper into the magical space. His perceptual signature is clear—that of a watchful, sensitive craftsman—and the prose rhythm reflects his quiet, deliberate nature, creating a cohesive and immersive narrative experience.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, creating a distinctive narrative voice that is both cerebral and lyrical. The prose has a specific texture that aligns perfectly with the setting and character. While elegant, the voice occasionally verges on being so self-aware of its own concepts that it creates a slight distance, as in "The tone of observed solitude hung about her like a veil."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a distinct lyrical and melancholic register throughout. While the prose texture is controlled, the voice feels more characteristic of a "literary fairytale" genre than of a unique, individual character. The perceptual signature lacks the idiosyncratic specificity needed for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is controlled and the narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical tone. The prose successfully maintains the intended atmosphere throughout. The voice, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied specifically to Elias; it reads more like a generic mythic narrator, which prevents it from achieving a higher level of character-specificity and distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and clarity, and the reflective, slightly academic voice is appropriate for the character. The prose, however, relies on a noticeable tic—the repetition of "crisp" ("crisp chill," "crisp reminder," "crisp nostalgia")—which slightly dulls the voice's distinctiveness. While the narrative stance is consistent, it lacks a unique perceptual signature that would elevate it to a truly memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, slightly formal tone, which suits the fable-like quality of the story. The primary weakness is a subtle but persistent POV wobble, shifting from Elara's perspective to grant access to Kael's internal state ("his defiance warring with curiosity," "intrigued despite himself"). This lack of strict focalization slightly undermines the narrative control.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained. The prose has a specific, elevated texture that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The psychic distance is stable, and the character's perception feels authentic to her role as a wise, nature-attuned guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone, and the third-person limited POV is controlled perfectly. However, the voice is significantly hampered by lexical repetition. Phrases like "lucid unrest" and "interlaced hush" are used so frequently they become authorial tics rather than expressions of a unique perceptual signature, slightly flattening the prose's texture and creating a sense of a formula being executed.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a distinct and consistent perceptual signature for Elias. The voice is literary and confident, and the psychic distance is expertly managed to build a quiet, scholarly intensity. The prose rhythm reflects the character's methodical nature, creating a coherent and immersive narrative stance without any slips or unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The point of view is controlled and the voice is distinct and consistent, effectively blending analytical precision with deep melancholy. The internal monologue addressed to "Mort" is an excellent device for establishing character and tone. The narrative distance is well-managed, though a few moments of reflection feel more like authorial summary than the character's immediate, in-the-moment thoughts, slightly flattening the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice aims for a consistent, wondrous tone. However, the repeated use of specific phrases—"driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder"—reads as a mechanical tic rather than an organic element of the voice. This repetition flattens the prose and makes the voice feel constructed and less character-particular, especially when applied to both Elowen's and Lira's perspectives.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and consistency. The narrative voice, however, tends toward an analytical distance, using abstract psychological terms that feel more like authorial summary than a character's internal experience. This "explaining" voice, while clear, lacks a distinct perceptual signature and flattens the emotional texture, particularly during moments of discovery where a more embodied perspective would be more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, creating a consistent and melancholic voice that suits the story's aims. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture, and the narrator's perceptual signature—seeing the world through the lens of emotional meteorology—is unique and compelling. Psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close during the emotional peak without any unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara's face blindness—her focus on patterns and light is consistent and effective. The voice is lyrical and sustained, modulating well with the rising internal pressure. The prose reflects the mind of the focalizer with no slippage or unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The point of view is controlled and consistent, with a distinct narrative voice that blends wonder with methodical observation, fitting for a "curious map apprentice." The psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close during moments of discovery. The prose has a specific, slightly formal rhythm that supports the antique, fantastical setting without becoming overwrought or obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the fantastical setting. The POV is stable and controlled. The main weakness is a lack of modulation; the prose remains at a high poetic pitch throughout, creating a uniform rhythm that slightly flattens the emotional dynamics of the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person POV lacks consistent focalization, shifting between Mara, Jax, and Lena's perspectives without clear section breaks, resulting in mild head-hopping. The narrative voice is competent and maintains a consistent, fable-like tone, but it remains at a slight distance, describing emotions rather than fully inhabiting them. Dialogue is functional, serving primarily to advance the plot or state thematic points, but lacks the character-specific rhythm and subtext expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and perfectly calibrated to the story's mythic, lyrical aims. The elevated, solemn prose maintains a consistent texture and rhythm that enhances the atmosphere of "eternal dusk." The point of view remains tightly controlled, with a psychic distance that feels appropriate for a character who has witnessed "a thousand lifetimes." The prose itself becomes a reflection of the character's ancient, solitary consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that deepens the melancholic tone. The narrative voice possesses a distinct perceptual signature; Elara’s "offhandedly exact" way of seeing the world shapes her observations and actions, making her solution feel inevitable. The prose rhythm and diction are perfectly calibrated to her character—observant, precise, and tinged with weariness.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the character's intellectual nature. POV is flawlessly controlled. However, the voice's texture is somewhat monotonous due to the relentless application of the symphony/polymer metaphor, and the final line of dialogue feels more like authorial summary than authentic character speech.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and maintains a distinct, elevated tone appropriate for the fantastical setting. The POV is controlled and stable. The primary weakness is that the prose's texture feels more attached to the story's central concepts than to a unique character's perceptual signature; the voice is that of the story's conceit, not necessarily Elara's own.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, establishing a mythic tone that fits the fantastical premise. POV is tightly controlled with a clear perceptual signature focused on sensory and emotional textures. The narrative distance is appropriate, and the prose rhythm successfully modulates between reflection and action, creating a cohesive and immersive experience without any technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone, establishing a clear fairytale-like mood. The POV remains tightly focused on Elara. However, the voice is also marred by a reliance on abstract, slightly cumbersome compound descriptors ("empathetic decisiveness," "vigorous tender resolve") that are repeated, creating a sense of being told rather than shown and lending a static quality to the prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent, but its elevated, academic register feels mismatched with the character's supposed emotional crisis. The prose has a distinct texture, but it's the texture of a conceptual essay, not a personal struggle. Phrases like "helix-minded" and "quantum threads" establish a particular voice, but it's one that maintains a narrative distance, keeping the reader analytical rather than immersed in the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, slightly arcane texture that fits the genre. The narrative stance is confident, and there are no technical slips in focalization. The voice avoids true distinction, however, relying on a competent but somewhat generic fantasy prose style rather than a truly unique perceptual signature for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical register appropriate for a fable-like narrative. The prose has a distinct, poetic texture. However, the psychic distance feels too great; the narration often explains Elara's internal state with abstract concepts ("her symphonically minded nature guided her") rather than immersing the reader in her direct sensory or emotional experience. This creates a voice that is more authorial than character-driven, observing Elara rather than fully inhabiting her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits the contemplative narrative. The voice possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through the lens of a chess strategist. The prose rhythm and syntax effectively mirror the character's pensive, analytical state of mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice has a distinct, if somewhat overwrought, texture. The prose is let down by repetitive, declarative phrases ("theatrical sincerity," "intuitively descriptive") that feel more like authorial labels than a character's authentic perceptual signature. This tic disrupts the voice's immersion, making it feel constructed and slightly monotonous in its key descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is lyrical and consistent. Elara’s olfactorily sensitive perception provides a distinct and effective perceptual signature that shapes how the world is rendered. The prose has a unique texture and rhythm that supports the story's contemplative, atmospheric tone without unmotivated shifts or a break in focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's adventurous, slightly mythic tone. While the prose is competent and clear, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature or texture. It reads as a well-executed genre voice rather than a unique and memorable narrative style.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the protagonist's professional, analytical mindset. The prose is clean and controlled, reflecting the "hazy precision" mentioned in the text. While the voice is fitting, it lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature that would make it memorable beyond its functional role in the procedural narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is consistent and the voice is distinct in its lyrical, elevated tone. However, the voice's uniqueness is weakened by the mechanical repetition of key phrases like "oscillating repose" and "sculpted hush." These phrases become authorial tics rather than organic expressions of the character's perception, creating a sense of a carefully constructed artifice that keeps the reader at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a voice appropriate for the high-fantasy register. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates well with the rising tension of the ritual. The narrative confidence is high, with no slips in focalization or unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.4)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and sustained throughout, creating a consistent and immersive texture. The prose possesses a clear perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elias's unique lexicon of cosmology and mathematics ("voids in the velvet sky like forgotten equations"). The narrative distance is expertly controlled, tightening as his internal state becomes more turbulent, without any slips in POV.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the lyrical, slightly mythic voice is consistent with the story's aims. The minimal dialogue is functional and reveals character. The narrative distance feels appropriate for a tale that is self-consciously becoming a legend. The score is slightly capped by prose artifacts that make the voice feel more like a thematic narrator than a deeply personal perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct perceptual signature for Elara that blends mysticism with grounded observation. The narrative voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating effectively with the rising tension. The brief dialogue is purposeful, serving as a catalyst for the central demonstration without any leakage or inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a generic lyrical narrator than a reflection of Elara's specific mind. The primary flaw is the mechanical repetition of key phrases ("stoically sparkling," "raveling silence"), which creates a patterned, artificial texture. This tic undermines the voice's authenticity and emotional power, making it feel constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical and elevated tone. The prose is controlled and maintains its texture throughout. The primary weakness is a slight disconnect between the grand, poetic narration and the "meek blacksmith" it describes; the voice feels more authorial than a deep embodiment of the character's specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, establishing a consistent, dreamlike tone. However, it is frequently compromised by its need to explain the story's conceptual framework. Lines like "The core concept of her craft was..." read as exposition delivered through the character's thoughts, breaking the immersive POV and creating a sense of distance from her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits the reticent protagonist. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture, evident in its rhythm and perceptual signature ("the way the waves curled like secrets"). The prose modulates effectively with the rising tension, remaining coherent and evocative even at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a distinct, elevated, and consistent narrative voice. The POV remains tightly controlled on Elowen, and the prose has a unique lyrical texture. The primary weakness is a consistently far psychic distance, which describes Elowen's state from the outside rather than inhabiting it, keeping the reader at an analytical remove from her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone of "valley-mist wonder." The point of view is controlled, and the prose's rhythm effectively supports the contemplative mood. The only minor weakness is that the voice sometimes strains for profundity, and the repetition of key prompt phrases like "iridescent caution" feels slightly imposed on the narration rather than emerging organically from the character's unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical, and elevated tone that suits the material. The prose texture is distinct. The only slight weakness is that the conceptual language used to describe the sextant's function—"pain as the base angle, longing as the hypotenuse"—can feel more like the narrator's intellectual framework than the plausible intuitive leap of a maintenance worker, creating a momentary distance from the character's specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice appropriate for its mythic tone, with stable POV control. The prose has a distinct texture, creating a strong sense of atmosphere. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, sometimes feeling more like a generic high-fantasy storyteller than a deep, specific filtering through this particular character's fragmented mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into a slightly formal, analytical register that feels more authorial than personal. Phrases like "enlarged tranquility" and the neat summary of his epiphany dilute the sense of an individual's genuine, messy internal experience, making the voice competent but not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice has a consistent, elegiac tone. However, the voice's distinctiveness is compromised by the repetitive use of key thematic jargon ("creeping normality," "tenuous absolution"). These phrases feel more like authorial keywords than a natural part of the character's internal lexicon, creating a slight register mismatch that feels artificial under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's formal, lyrical tone. The prose has a distinct, if somewhat uniform, rhythm that suits the solemn atmosphere. While the voice is controlled, it lacks a truly idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would elevate it from highly competent to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent. The prose texture—a mix of the lyrical and the tense—perfectly matches the story's tone. The focalization stays tightly bound to Elara's perceptions, and her internal thoughts feel authentic to her established character and the high-pressure situation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and speculative tone that fits the "futuristic nostalgia" theme perfectly. The third-person limited POV is controlled and confident, filtering the fantastical world through Elara's specific perceptions without any slips. The prose has a strong, memorable texture that enhances the story's atmosphere and character.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, and the narrative voice has a consistent, literary texture that suits the introspective mood. The psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elias's internal state without leakage or unmotivated shifts. The prose rhythm and perceptual signature are distinct and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and consistency. The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that is well-suited to the story's speculative, melancholic world. The prose rhythm and perceptual signature remain stable and effective, creating a cohesive and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, with a distinct and consistent lyrical voice. The narrative's perceptual signature—attuned to harmony, light, and resonance—perfectly reflects the protagonist's nature. The prose maintains its unique texture and rhythm under pressure, resulting in a cohesive and immersive narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice possesses a consistent, lyrical quality befitting a "nostalgic android." The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the technical crisis through a lens of inherited memory and wistfulness. There are no slips in psychic distance, and the prose texture remains coherent even as the internal static intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's gentle tone. The primary weakness lies in the dialogue, which often serves as direct exposition. Lines like "Seek young Tomas; he knows the key's shadow" feel stilted and lack the subtext or naturalism of compelling speech.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical and slightly detached tone, fitting for the "lyrical code breaker" concept. The point of view is stable, and the narrative prose has a distinct texture. However, the elevated register occasionally feels uniform, lacking modulation to reflect the subtle shifts in Elara's internal state during her long isolation, making the voice feel more like a stylistic overlay than a true reflection of character.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the lyrical, measured voice is a good match for the story's tone. The prose, however, sometimes drifts into a more authorial register that explains concepts ("pockets of gravity as repositories") rather than filtering them entirely through Elias's specific perceptual signature. While the voice is strong, this occasional psychic distance prevents it from achieving a truly distinct, character-bound texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, elevated tone that fits the summoner's character. POV is handled with clean, unwavering control. The primary weakness is a slight monotony in rhythm and the repetitive use of key phrases like "terrestrially cosmic," which feels more like a prompt requirement than an organic part of the narrator's perceptual signature, creating a noticeable artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV on Elias is maintained with good control and consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice has a distinct, literary quality that fits the story's tone of "mysterious familiarity." Dialogue is functional and goal-driven, though it occasionally serves plot mechanics more than revealing deeper subtext. Overall, the voice is confident and the perspective is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with perfect stability, and the lyrical voice is consistent. However, the prose relies on the mechanical repetition of specific, elevated phrases ("ghostly resolve," "tragically radiant," "charmed skeptic"), which can make the voice feel constructed rather than organic. This pattern-repetition gives the voice a distinct texture but sacrifices a more natural, character-particular perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with stability and control, and the elevated, formal voice is consistent with the tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a well-crafted genre style than the specific interiority of this character. The prose serves the story well but never fully crystallizes into a unique narrative persona.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent and distinct lyrical voice throughout. The narrative prose has a strong, memorable texture that aligns with the story's melancholic tone. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven, effectively executing the "progressive disclosure" method without disrupting the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a distinct and consistent narrative voice that embodies the story's "borrowed starlight" tone. The prose has a specific perceptual signature; Elara notices the world in a way that is unique to her profession and worldview. The rhythmic, lyrical quality of the narration is controlled and purposeful, modulating perfectly with the scene's quiet intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, perfectly matching the "net-mender philosopher" persona. The POV is controlled with no slips, and the psychic distance is expertly managed for a contemplative mood. The prose has a clear perceptual signature. The only minor weakness is that the voice is so polished and articulate that it can feel slightly impersonal, sacrificing some raw emotional texture for philosophical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    The point of view is controlled and consistent, with a distinct narrative voice that perfectly captures Elias's analytical and skeptical worldview. His perceptual signature—noticing scientific details over mystical ones—is a key element of his characterization. The prose maintains its clarity and focus, modulating subtly in the final moments to allow for the intrusion of doubt, which enhances the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical tone appropriate for a prophetic visionary. The point of view is stable, and the perceptual signature—filtering the world through sound, static, and stormlight—is well-executed. However, the narrative voice is so uniformly poetic that it occasionally lacks modulation, maintaining the same high register even when describing more mundane actions like tuning dials, which slightly reduces its dynamic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece establishes a distinct and consistent lyrical voice that aligns with the "penny poet" character concept. The third-person limited POV is controlled and stable. The primary weakness is a lack of modulation; the elevated, romantic tone is applied uniformly, and the triple repetition of the phrase "positively wistful" stands out as a significant authorial tic that undermines the voice's organic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with no technical slips. The narrative voice has a consistent, elevated tone. However, the voice often feels more authorial than character-bound, using abstract, poetic language ("blending the corporeal chill with an otherworldly warmth") that feels disconnected from the plausible perceptions of an engineer under duress. This creates a psychic distance that can keep the reader from fully inhabiting the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, measured tone. Psychic distance is well-controlled, reflecting Elara's restrained nature. However, the voice, while consistent, lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally feeling more like a generic "epic fantasy" register than a unique character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into a formal, almost academic register that feels more authorial than character-driven, particularly when explaining the story's supernatural mechanics. While the prose is clear, this register and the repetition of key phrases like "watchfully calm" prevent the voice from achieving a truly distinct or memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, but the narrative voice is overwrought with ornate phrasing that sometimes feels strained. Dialogue is a significant weakness; it lacks naturalism and distinction, with both characters speaking in the same formal, thematic register. The lines serve to explain the plot and theme directly, functioning as exposition rather than character-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and stylistically consistent, establishing a strong "steampunk poetic" tone. However, the psychic distance occasionally wavers, with descriptions like "gears grinding like cosmic laughter" feeling more like grand authorial pronouncements than perceptions filtered through the character's specific point of view. While the voice is controlled, this slight wobble prevents it from achieving flawless immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Point of view is controlled and consistent, with a narrative voice that is clear, competent, and well-suited to the methodical protagonist. The psychic distance is expertly managed, drawing the reader into Elara's obsessive focus. While the voice is highly effective, it lacks a truly unique or surprising stylistic signature that would mark it as exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical texture. The prose aligns well with the ethereal, somber mood of the world. While the voice is controlled and professional, it lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it from very good to exceptional; it sometimes reads like a high-quality version of a familiar fantasy register.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and impeccably sustained, creating a lyrical and slightly detached tone that perfectly mirrors Elara's altered mental state. The narrative maintains a consistent psychic distance, and the prose has a clear perceptual signature; we see this desolate world through her rewired senses. The control and specificity of the point of view are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is consistently held, and the voice is lyrical and controlled. However, the prose lacks a distinct character-particular texture, reading more like a detached, elegant authorial voice than the internal experience of a solitary vineyard guardian. The language is consistently elevated ("etched against the fading twilight," "weaving gently persuasive threads"), which establishes a mood but flattens Elias's individual perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent, elevated, and mythic voice that suits the material. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature focused on subtle energies and hidden patterns. The voice is controlled and purposeful, though it lacks significant modulation, maintaining a similar register even during the climactic ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains its gentle, lyrical tone. However, the narrative voice and Elara's internal perspective are nearly identical, lacking a distinct perceptual signature that separates her inner world from the story's descriptive prose. The prose is clean but lacks the unique texture that would elevate it, sometimes feeling more like a beautifully written summary than an immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and masterfully sustained, with a contemplative, literary rhythm that perfectly suits the character and setting. The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, ensuring every perception is filtered through Elias's scholarly and reticent nature. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, with no slips in psychic distance or tone.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that suits the material. However, the prose occasionally feels slightly mannered and overly reliant on high-register abstractions like "tidal longing" and "ephemeral shapes." This creates a consistent tone but sacrifices some of the sharp, particular voice that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is distinct, elevated, and lyrical, maintaining a consistent tone that suits the sage-like protagonist and cosmic setting. The point of view is controlled and stable, with a clear perceptual signature focused on light, time, and delicate mechanics. While effective, the prose at times leans heavily on its own lyricism, bordering on a register that feels more authorial than character-bound under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person POV is controlled, and the voice maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical tone that matches the story's serene, ethereal setting. While the prose can feel ornate, it establishes a distinct perceptual signature. The brief dialogue is functional, though it doesn't carry significant subtext, serving primarily to advance the plot's emotional beats in a straightforward manner.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the voice feels somewhat generic and emotionally distant. It relies on telling rather than showing character state, as seen in the repeated label "quietly deliberate." The prose has a slightly formal, explanatory tone that reports on events rather than immersing the reader in Elara's direct sensory and emotional experience, which dulls the immediacy of the otherwise magical proceedings.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice is hampered by a recurring set of abstract, slightly stilted keywords ("innovation," "cleft in certainty," "shrewdly innocent") that feel imposed upon the character's interiority. This creates a distance and an artificial texture, reading more like an author fulfilling a brief than a character's organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the mythic tone. Elara's perceptual signature is distinct, filtering all descriptions through her celestial past and earthbound present. The prose rhythm supports the story's languid, deliberate pacing, creating a cohesive and immersive narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's reflective mood. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature focused on natural decay and quiet patterns. The dialogue, however, is sparse and overly functional ("I followed the patterns"), lacking the subtext and naturalism present in the narrative prose, creating a slight dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story maintains a consistent, elevated third-person voice with a distinct literary texture. However, the voice is weakened by the verbatim repetition of key phrases like "lucidly watchful" and "swirling hush." These recurrences feel less like intentional motifs and more like authorial tics or scaffolding, slightly diminishing the voice's organic quality and creating a sense of programmatic construction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fairy-tale-like register that is well-suited to the material. Point of view is controlled effectively within a close third person, and the prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythm. The narrative distance remains stable, effectively modulating to convey the hushed, sacred atmosphere of the climax without any unmotivated shifts or authorial intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    The authorial voice is distinct, lyrical, and masterfully controlled, maintaining a solemn, mythic tone that perfectly suits the material. The third-person limited POV remains flawlessly stable, creating a focused, almost hypnotic experience that mirrors the character's ritualistic concentration. The prose itself has a consistent and memorable perceptual signature, filtering the world through an alchemist's precise and patient gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a consistent and highly controlled third-person limited POV. The narrative voice is distinct, with a lyrical and contemplative rhythm that perfectly matches the protagonist's reflective nature. The established perceptual signature of "peripheral focus" is used effectively to drive observation and discovery. The prose as a whole is clean, demonstrating a strong command of psychic distance and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and masterfully sustains the "whalebone reverie" tone throughout, creating a unique and memorable texture. The third-person limited POV remains stable and effective, filtering all perception through the weaver's fractal-oriented mind. The prose is confident and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a consistent psychic distance while creating a distinct and lyrical voice for Elara. Her perceptual signature is strong; every observation is filtered through her grief and her husband's life, as seen in how the rain on the skylight appears "like tears frozen in descent." The prose rhythm modulates effectively with her emotional state, showing excellent control.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the setting. The third-person limited POV is controlled and effective. The prose could have more fully embodied the "chronologically confused" state through syntactic fragmentation, but the existing voice has a strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice feels slightly generic and overly formal. The frequent use of abstract, authorial-sounding labels like "functionally creative" or "maze of intentions" creates a psychic distance that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting Elara's perspective. The prose texture is uniform, lacking the rhythmic modulation that would reflect her internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, elevated tone throughout. The prose has a distinct texture that aligns with the story's contemplative mood. However, the voice feels more authorial than character-specific; its poetic register is so consistent that it occasionally obscures a unique perceptual signature for Elias himself, reading less like his mind and more like a beautiful narration of it.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a controlled psychic distance. The narrative voice has a distinct, literary texture. However, the voice's integrity is compromised by the mechanical repetition of specific phrases, which can feel less like an organic perceptual signature and more like adherence to an external constraint, creating a slightly artificial cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that feels both intimate and mythic. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical texture, with syntax and rhythm that mirror the story’s quiet, deliberate pace. The brief dialogue is perfectly pitched, feeling otherworldly yet clear, enhancing the story's established tone without disrupting it.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and highly controlled, establishing a melancholic and elevated tone that perfectly suits the material. The third-person limited POV maintains a steady psychic distance, filtering all sensory details and reflections through Elias's unique perspective. The prose rhythm and sophisticated diction create a memorable narrative texture that carries the story's emotional weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the third-person limited POV is consistent, the narrative voice is compromised by severe syntactic monotony. The overuse of "he hypothesized" and other prompt keywords creates a templated, artificial cadence that feels imposed upon the character rather than emerging from him. This repetitive structure inhibits the development of a truly distinct perceptual signature, making the voice feel programmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is controlled, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for a fable-like narrative. The third-person limited POV is stable and effective. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, feeling more like a polished authorial overlay than the specific, idiosyncratic thoughts of this particular character, a quality exacerbated by the mechanical repetition of certain descriptive phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained without error, but the narrative voice feels slightly detached and overly formal. The prose has a distinct, elevated texture, but it sometimes slips into a pattern of stating character traits and feelings rather than fully inhabiting them. The repeated phrase "defiant hush" feels more like an authorial motif being enforced than a natural perception from the character, creating a distance that mutes the voice's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the otherworldly, sentimentalist character. The POV is flawlessly maintained, with a consistent psychic distance that modulates effectively with the building tension. The prose possesses a unique perceptual signature, filtering the cosmic setting through Elowen’s specific melancholy and resolve, creating a seamless and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a potent, somber mood. The POV is controlled and the prose has a clear rhythmic quality. However, the score is slightly capped by the repetition of specific, stylized phrases like "fiercely meditative" and "thundering calm," which function as minor authorial tics that momentarily thin the otherwise unique narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the psychic distance shifts effectively to match the intensity of the "searing reverie." The narrative voice has a consistent, slightly mythic texture that suits the story's tone. The prose signature is distinct and carries the narrative's weight without any slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is controlled and the voice is distinct and consistent, creating a strong lyrical and melancholic mood. The narrative stance and psychic distance are stable, effectively filtering all perception through Elias's gentle worldview. While the prose texture is rich, its consistency is a strength of the voice, even if it verges on being overly stylized at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a consistent and distinct narrative voice. The prose has a measured, lyrical quality that aligns perfectly with the story's contemplative tone and Elara's methodical character. The voice remains stable and confident, modulating appropriately as Elara approaches the critical moment of creation, with a clear perceptual signature focused on patterns, data, and potential.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical voice is generally consistent, but it is undermined by the heavy-handed repetition of key phrases ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous"). This patterned repetition feels more like adherence to a checklist than an organic narrative voice, creating a slightly artificial texture.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent, somber voice that perfectly suits the story's tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the surreal gallery through Elias’s weary, philosophical lens. The narrative distance is managed with precision, drawing the reader close without ever breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elias's intellectual world. The voice, defined as an "abrasive calm," is distinct and sustained through a specific lexical and syntactical texture. There are no slips in focalization, and the prose consistently reflects the character's state of mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice is lyrical and consistent. The narrative tone aligns perfectly with the atmosphere. The primary weakness is the verbatim repetition of key phrases from the prompt ("expectantly resigned," "vanishing arts," "by subtracting noise," "traveled stillness"). This creates a slightly mechanical feel, as if the voice is constrained by a checklist, which prevents it from feeling fully organic and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is lyrical and generally consistent, but the POV modesty breaks with the introduction of "synaptic plasticity." It's unlikely an "informally wise" chef would frame his mystical work in such a precise, academic register. This brief but jarring shift into an expository voice pulls the reader out and feels like an authorial intrusion explaining the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is atmospheric and consistent in its lyrical, honeyed tone. However, the point of view, primarily a close third on Elara, leaks into Thorne's consciousness ("Thorne's motivation burned quietly within him," "Thorne smiled candidly"). While minor, these slips momentarily break the established psychic distance and betray a need to narrate what could have been shown through his actions alone.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent "hushed blaze" tone that is highly effective. The third-person limited POV is controlled with no leakage, and the narrative distance is perfectly calibrated to the story's intimate, contemplative mood. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythm that makes the voice feel singular and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. Liriel’s telepathic voice has a distinct texture ("a scalpel wrapped in silk"), which is a strong choice. Elara's internal voice, however, is less distinct, often relying on standard phrasing ("her heart pounding," "her mind racing") that feels more functional than character-specific. The prose is clean, but the overall voice lacks a memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a voice that reflects the protagonist's intellectual and melancholic nature. The prose has a distinct, formal rhythm appropriate for the character. The only minor friction comes from the verbatim repetition of the phrase "balancedly daring," which feels like an external constraint rather than an organic part of the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical, controlled, and maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the magical-realist subject matter. The point of view is stable, and the perceptual signature—a focus on light, history, and quiet detail—is distinct and well-maintained. While the prose is beautiful, its uniform polish slightly mutes the gritty exhaustion of insomnia, presenting a romanticized rather than embodied experience of the condition.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct, slightly formal and historically-inflected voice for Elara. Her perceptual signature is clear, filtering the world through her concern for art and history. The prose has a distinct rhythm that supports the story's elegiac but hopeful tone.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Point of view is stable and effective. The narrative voice is consistent in its formal, gothic tone. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes feeling more like a grand narrator than Elias's specific mind. The repetition of key phrases ("bleak exhilaration") feels like a narrative tic rather than a character-specific obsession, slightly dulling the voice's uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice establishes a fitting gothic tone. The advisor's dialogue is stylized and effective. However, the prose sometimes lacks a truly unique perceptual signature for Elias, occasionally relying on slightly generic descriptions of internal states and actions, which prevents the voice from achieving exceptional distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, perfectly matching the mythic, archetypal nature of the story. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture, and the POV remains tightly focused and controlled, modulating with the rising tension. The narrative stance is confident, creating a powerful sense of an ancient legend being told. The perceptual signature feels unique to this specific, sea-worn character.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a narrative voice that effectively establishes a formal, mythic tone. The focalization through Elara's cartographic lens—her attention to patterns, light, and heat—creates a distinct perceptual signature. While the prose is elegant, it lacks a final, idiosyncratic rhythm that would elevate it from highly competent to truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a narrative voice that fits the historian's intellectual and reflective nature. The prose maintains a distinct, slightly formal texture throughout. While the voice is highly competent and suits the material perfectly, it doesn't possess a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lyrical and somber voice appropriate for the story. The prose has a distinct, elevated texture that effectively builds atmosphere. However, the voice is weakened by a recurring tic: the repetition of key phrases like "hushed blaze" and "stoically sensitive," which feels less like a deliberate motif and more like a limitation in the narrative lexicon, slightly dulling its unique signature.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It often defaults to a slightly distant, explanatory tone that summarizes Elara's thought processes rather than immersing the reader in them. The voice is further flattened by the repetitive insertion of assigned keywords, which feel less like organic character thought and more like authorial scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is highly stylized and consistent, creating a distinct, ethereal atmosphere. The third-person limited POV is well-controlled. The prose maintains its lyrical, melancholic texture throughout, but this uniformity sometimes lacks modulation, causing the emotional intensity to feel sustained at one high pitch rather than dynamic, especially under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The limited third-person POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a voice that is both analytical and deeply wounded, fitting for a physicist processing trauma. The narrative's perceptual signature is distinct, filtering reality through concepts like "perturbation theory" and "quantum foam," which makes the speculative elements feel grounded in his character. Psychic distance shifts appropriately, drawing close during moments of high emotion without ever breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a steady, lyrical tone. However, the voice is hampered by lexical repetition, particularly the recycling of key phrases like "perpetual surprise" and "brilliant dimness." This tic creates a mechanical rhythm and slightly genericizes the perceptual signature, making Elara's internal experience feel less distinct and more like an echo of the story's keywords.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The POV is controlled and the narrative voice is consistent, establishing a somber, literary tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm. The main weakness is that the voice feels slightly too polished and articulate for a character in a state of emotional crisis. The sophisticated, conceptual language ("sieved hush," "tempered regret") sometimes creates distance, reading more like a narrator's reflection on the character than the character's own immediate, unfiltered experience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The limited third-person POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a voice that is formal, measured, and perfectly suited to Elias's character. The prose has a distinct and consistent texture, with a rhythm that reflects the protagonist's contemplative nature. Psychic distance is managed well, drawing the reader close to Elias's internal anxieties without ever breaking from his perspective. The minimal dialogue is functional and sharp, enhancing the sense of tense formality without unnecessary exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and fittingly melancholic voice with a distinct rhythmic quality. The narrative distance is generally well-controlled. Yet, the voice is occasionally compromised by the same diagnostic language that affects characterization, momentarily shifting the register from intimate interiority to a more analytical, authorial summary, which creates a subtle but noticeable psychic distance at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, and the narrative voice effectively captures the specified "jaded wonder" tone. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture that reflects Alex's hollowed-out but observant state. There are no slips in focalization or unearned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece maintains a consistent, lyrical voice and a stable third-person limited POV. The prose has a distinct fairy-tale texture. However, the voice is hampered by the repetition of key abstract phrases, most notably "cosmic intimacy" (used three times), which becomes a narrative tic rather than a deepening motif. This repetition slightly flattens the voice's overall impact and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece establishes a distinct, elevated, and lyrical voice that is consistently maintained. Elara's perspective as a cartomancer, seeing the world in patterns and portents, provides a specific perceptual signature. However, the narrative voice remains at a nearly uniform high intensity, lacking modulation in rhythm and texture, which makes it feel slightly breathless and less dynamic than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The point of view is stable and effective, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose often adopts a slightly formal, explanatory tone that reports on Lira’s state rather than fully inhabiting her experience. While clear, the voice could achieve greater immediacy and character-specificity to elevate the story further.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Point of view is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, lyrical tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to Elias; it often reads like a slightly detached, poetic narrator describing events rather than filtering them through the specific biases of a destitute philanthropist. Mira's dialogue is purely expository, existing only to deliver the prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with clean control and a consistent, slightly elevated voice. The brief dialogue exchange is a highlight, packed with subtext that reveals character and advances the plot. The narrative voice is confident, though moments of interiority occasionally slip into generic phrasing that doesn't feel as distinctive as the story's unique premise.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the world. The point of view has a strong perceptual signature, filtering all descriptions through the lens of slipperiness and faint light. The prose is controlled and effective, with only minor repetitive phrasing ("borrowed dawn," "lingering promise") keeping it from achieving a flawless rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV is consistent and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture suitable for a poet. However, the prose frequently becomes overwrought, with a self-conscious elevation that can feel strained rather than authentic. The narrative voice relies on some stock phrasing for interiority, and the psychic distance remains somewhat uniform, missing opportunities to modulate syntax and rhythm to reflect Elias's shift from simmering rage to focused creation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, and the narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the protagonist's scholarly-yet-dangerous persona. The prose has a unique texture, with a formal, rhythmic cadence that effectively supports the "dignified chaos" tone. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, functioning as a strategic extension of character and conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and highly stylized. The lyrical, elevated tone is maintained effectively throughout, shaping the story's atmosphere. The primary weakness is a slight lack of modulation and a reliance on recurring keywords—notably "fracture" and "luminous"—which begin to feel like a tic rather than a freshly chosen image, slightly dulling the prose's impact through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with stability and a consistent, lyrical voice. The narrator's perceptual focus rightly aligns with Elias's goals. The score is held back slightly by moments where the voice slips into authorial summary, such as stating "Elias was strategically creative," which tells the reader a trait rather than purely filtering it through Elias's own thoughts and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the tone and character. However, the repeated use of key phrases like "empirically whimsical" and "luminous doubt" becomes a noticeable tic that slightly undermines the voice's organic quality. While these repetitions reinforce the theme, their frequency borders on mechanical, slightly dulling an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, with a measured rhythm that reflects the "slow-spoken" protagonist and the placid setting. The psychic distance is controlled, and the world is filtered effectively through Elias's specific "cerulean regret." The prose has a clear perceptual signature, making for a cohesive and immersive point of view without any technical flaws.

Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, teaching patterned elision of magical elements early for legibility at closure. Strength is controlled psychic distance serving emotional beats; weakness is minor register drift into elevated diction like "ethereal light" that slightly jars POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elias's dramatic narrations biasing observations toward epic saga, modulating rhythm under pressure like fervent exclamations as water rises. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, theatrical syntax, with purposeful compression in reflections taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean without filter stacks. Minor register drift in elevated diction like "molten heart" fits voice but borders on jarring in solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in fear-tinged observations, but diction drifts into elevated register like "wheeled above, indifferent and vast" that feels jarring for the stunt double's voice. Brief dialogue at the end carries subtext and advances the confrontation naturally. No head-hopping, but some filter verbs dull immediacy in peak stress moments.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in gardening lexicon ("loamy soil," "velvet cloth") and rhythmic control during decoding, but "velveteen gloom" overuse edges toward voice drift in early high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("perpetual winter winds whispered secrets") and rhythmic control shine, though "groundedly imaginative" slightly disrupts voice coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers stained with ink," "dust motes mimicked narratives") modulates rhythm effectively, though minor POV slippage in "listeners puzzled" slightly disrupts focalization control.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature is Elias’s fixation on fragility ("fragile black dust," "cracks like veins"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical description to clipped action ("removed the mask... scattered ashes"), with patterned elision (gallery’s loops) taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in taste-driven observations ("bitter-sweet farewells" on air), though Elias’ voice flattens slightly during synaptic plasticity exposition in peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("honeyed light," "trapped firefly") persists under pressure; sentence rhythm modulates perfectly from ominous ("whispers of panic") to resonant ("stars pricked the honeyed sky").

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct "hushed blaze" perceptual signature sustains voice under pressure; rhythmic control in ritual sequence ("walls whispering faintly... resonated, shifting slightly") avoids lyric clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elara's diving-suit "hissing" and "bubbles like hesitant thoughts" mirror internal state. Liriel's "scalpel wrapped in silk" telepathy avoids generic wisdom, though "incisively kind" risks label-speak without sufficient action constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in math descriptions, but "balancedly daring" phrasing creates register drift; rhythmic control strong except for academic diction in proof sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("floral unease like rosewater masking dread") modulates perfectly under stress; rhythmic control in "dread softened, rosewater yielding to hope" crystallizes turning point without telling.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct clockmaker voice ("neatly inventive," "dissonant harmony") with rhythmic control under pressure; psychic distance tightens during activation ("heart pounded"). No POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct synesthetic voice ("clouds as omens," "fruit bobbed like notes") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift with "euphony" prevents 9.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines in shell-pattern observations ("light filtered through translucent layers, casting patterns that danced like warnings"); consistent lyrical compression avoids head-hopping while modulating under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ivy clung like whispered secrets") and rhythmic control elevate voice, but filter-verb stacks ("Elias had spent," "he believed") in opening dull immediacy. Lexicon stays consistent though stress narrows sensory detail insufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (surveyor's precision meets poetic sensitivity) modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "hushed blaze" metaphors during high-tide struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: 'dappled shadows mirrored resolve' reflects indexer's pattern-recognition. Rhythm modulates perfectly—short sentences during crisis ('locks sealed'), lyrical flow in reflection. Zero POV leakage; lexicon stays within character's logical framework.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("tormenting glows on blooming lotuses"); rhythmic control modulates perfectly from "luminous haze" to fragmented intensity during polishing ritual, with all elision taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in physicist-specific observations ("fractals of atmospheric data swirling like ghosts"), though minor register drift occurs when abstract concepts like "intangibly tangible" momentarily override character-particular diction during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature (drone-pilot precision in "sharp eyes scanned," "anomalies others might miss") with rhythmic control. Stress moments maintain articulate diction unnaturally ("voice steady despite surprise flickering"), slightly undermining authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("driftwood littered the sand like remnants of shattered lives"), with rhythmic control deepening under stress; minor repetition of "sieved hush" dilutes precision in final beats despite lyrical cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices textures (brass warmth, rope friction) not scenery. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in clipped phrases during exchange ("Elias raised his hand... voice low and measured"), though "hushed resolve" edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct nautical voice sustains under pressure with rhythmic pole-counting, though minimal filter verbs ("he recalled") barely dent perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("jaded wonder," "con artist’s eye for deception") modulates rhythm under pressure; newspaper misprints read as authentic micro-choices, with elision (memory wipe mechanics) taught early and paid off in the lake revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("roses that tasted of salt and sorrow") modulates with stress; rhythmic control shines in ritual sequence. Slight register drift in "deliberate labyrinth" momentarily distances voice during high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Lira's focus on "emotional imprints" and "shimmering" tears. Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure (e.g., shortening during shadow emergence), though occasional poetic phrasing risks distancing in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ashen soil," "celestial ballet") and rhythmic control under pressure excel, but elevated diction ("languid waltz") during high-stakes rockslide scene disrupts POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("winking hush," "coded angles") with rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from "calm inventiveness" to "thrill" without head-hopping, meeting 9+ quick test despite minor register drift in "innocuous artistry."

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("borrowed dawn," mathematical metaphors) modulates under pressure; rhythmic control intensifies during rock placement with purposeful elision of the curse's physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature excels: "clouds below boiled like an unquiet sea" filters astronomy through emotional lens; rhythmic control intensifies during storm peaks without sacrificing clarity or voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "sunlight fractured into rainbows" and "dignified chaos" modulates under pressure; minor ornateness in opening slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
