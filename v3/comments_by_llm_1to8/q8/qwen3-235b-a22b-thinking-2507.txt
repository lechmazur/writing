  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fusion of a foster‑care archive with a Civil War relic yields a fresh, emotionally credible angle on legacy. The “archivist of kindness” reframing feels specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    While the rebel-against-dystopia frame is familiar, the puddle-constellation navigation, auric-resonance terminal, and janitor’s covert language of maintenance feel fresh and integrated.

Not revolutionary, but confidently original in texture and execution.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
