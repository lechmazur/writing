  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fresh synthesis: a poet‑coded garage sale as signal net; a world where numbers fail; an emerald silo archiving felt time.

Risk‑taking elevates without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The synthesis—floating dojo, time rewriting, a DUPLICATE brain vivified by complementary opposites—feels fresh and thematically integrated. The turn to responsibility over simple catharsis avoids the obvious moral. Risks (lyric register, conceptual ritual) pay off with coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fresh synthesis: an escape‑room designer receives a corpse‑flower seed as a long‑arc puzzle from a legendary mentor; the living contract trope feels distinctive.

Surface motifs support genuine emotional specificity rather than mere ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seed‑as‑soul anchor and the waterfall‑veil as a practical portal offer a fresh inflection, but the guardian‑restores‑world premise and diction are familiar.

Solid, not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The net that “accumulates silence” and the restorer‑as‑psychopomp premise feel fresh and integrated.

The closing move to annotate rather than break in carries distinctive integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fresh synthesis: a sunken ship library, a lead‑fused strongbox, and a snow globe as a literal anchor to a pocket moment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    A fresh synthesis: a face-blind portraitist decoding a fractal coin to unlock a tree-library’s heart and contain a living sky.

A hair more cost or a surprising counter‑pressure could lift it into the next band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The eclipse-as-shadow-key for a frozen Orrery in a mirror chamber feels fresh and integrated, not a collage of tropes. The specific mechanism (absent light revealing a crescent keyhole) is ingeniously tied to lineage and purpose. While the premise uses familiar fantasy furniture, it’s recombined with conceptual clarity and tactile specificity. Risk is taken in maintaining lyric density under pressure, and it pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Inventive synthesis: chalk‑borne guidance from an altruistic ghost and a humble watering bell retuned into planetary infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker/mechanical-bird labyrinth synthesis feels fresh; tropes are grounded in sensory specificity. The “graceless beauty” of Elias’s telekinetic assembly is a non-obvious inflection. The cracked nut’s reprise is inevitable in hindsight. Risky compression (no dialogue, single scene) heightens stakes without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)

Risk in the lyric grotto sequence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Choral librarian who 'sings' code-songs to sentient grain elevators is inventive and thematically integral. Execution commits fully to the conceit, culminating in a resonant, non-obvious reconfiguration of shared memory.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)

Transformation test passed: story collapses if any core element is swapped.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)

Execution feels inevitable, not gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Premise—olfactory herbalist in floating village cultivating corpse flower—feels fresh yet inevitable. Integration avoids trope parade; world logic (tree-ropes, air, scent as knowledge) specific to lens. “Doodling diagnostic scents on recycled wrapping paper” reinvents journaling trope; risky yet coherent. Slight reservation: seed’s eventual rot potential underplayed, so minus 0.2 for missed leverage. Still distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inversion-hour as navigational window, the arrow relic as map, and the geode as memory-bank synthesize into a fresh planetary myth. Risk: gravity reversal could read gimmick, but it’s taught early and paid off at closure. Specificity—“gossamer-fruit trees,” “ochre soil”—anchors the fantastical.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Central premise—letterpress as grief algebra—feels fresh and inevitable, synthesizing steampunk, intangible cosmology, and interior pain. No contemporary echo gluts the design; it trusts specificity (type slugs clicking like bones) to brand its own daylight on the trope field.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fresh synthesis of deep-sea cryptology with dance-as-algorithm is specific and memorable. Dice-as-entropy key flips genre assumptions.

Could edge into exceptional if one more visible external cost scarred the world.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    “Mapping silence” as active cartography feels fresh, and the origami wing’s transformation from starlight key to inert paper offers a lovely conceptual reprice. The contagion-of-whispers premise is familiar, but the solution route (expanding stillness rather than battling sound) supplies a non-obvious inflection. Risk is moderate—lyric accretion over plot danger—so the piece stops short of the highest originality band.
