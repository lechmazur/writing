  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The synthesis of glass artistry with smuggling investigation offers fresh territory, and the transformation of artistic destruction into moral choice elevates beyond genre expectations. The specific detail of reading frost patterns as navigation and the kiln serving as both artistic and criminal waypoint creates memorable originality, though the revenge-to-forgiveness arc itself follows familiar patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Highly original synthesis of synesthesia, post-apocalyptic setting, and musical physics creates something genuinely fresh. The concept of tuning forks that emit color rather than sound, translating emotion into visible wavelengths, shows exceptional inventiveness. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and abstract closure elevates this (+0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    Fresh synthesis of undertaker-as-psychopomp with underwater library of the unburied creates genuine originality. The broken lighthouse lens becoming a tool for recording the lost dead transforms expected tropes. Risk-taking in the magical realist mode pays off, though "occupying impossible spaces" feels slightly workshopped against the otherwise organic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The exile community's midnight food runs offer a fresh angle on survival narratives, avoiding both misery porn and false uplift. The antique bell as continuity object and the saffron-memory moment show specific invention. The anonymous donation system provides original texture though doesn't fully transform the broader exile trope.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Fresh synthesis of camera obscura artistry with past-life healing creates non-obvious angle. The specific combination of Kwan Yin's tear, photographic inversion, and breath-work feels original.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The synesthetic hearing-aid designer crafting silence from absence offers genuinely fresh angle on grief and betrayal. Post-flood underwater orchard with biological time creates original world-logic. Risk-taking through lyric accumulation and the choice of witness over warning elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    The portrait thief who releases rather than keeps her stolen moments offers a fresh angle on possession and beauty. The flower-code system and jar of moonbeams create specific world-logic. The transformation from thief to one who releases is earned through accumulated particulars, though some elements feel ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    The concept of a glassblower seeking refuge in an abandoned weather station offers fresh specificity. The integration of craft (glassblowing) with emotional arc (learning to stay) through the unifying metaphor of temperature and malleability shows originality. However, the "safe zones for inquiry" concept remains somewhat abstract, and the theatrical narration device, while distinctive, doesn't fully transform familiar abandonment/commitment themes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stunt double discovering they're a manufactured twin offers fresh angle on identity theft. The encrypted cast as repository of truth shows ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Fresh synthesis of oracle-as-cartographer mapping negative space, with the specific innovation of translating silence types into topographical notation. The concept of creating a navigation guide for "endless night" transforms the oracle trope through concrete, non-obvious execution.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Fresh synthesis of robot consciousness and guilt through the loop-as-refinement concept.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lens-as-decoder device offers fresh functionality beyond typical symbolic use, and the cryptic doodles as confession method shows ingenuity.

Risk-taking in the non-linear time perception pays off, though the execution occasionally relies on familiar sci-fi furniture.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    The synthesis of ghost story, musical performance, and water as medium creates genuine freshness. The specific choice to have Mara perform the code through her clarinet touching flood water, rather than simply reading it, transforms the expected haunted theater premise. The risk of merging accumulative design with concrete physical exploration pays off in the transformed ending.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fault-tolerant oracle concept offers fresh angle—someone who accumulates error until contradiction becomes bearable, applied to climate grief. The 4.7 grams literalization of silence's weight is inventive. However, the climate change guilt narrative follows familiar templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail, and some imagery (weather vane as compass, roots as questions) relies on expected metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    The synthesis of urban exploration, industrial haunting, and psychic radio creates genuine freshness. The specific detail of measuring guilt in grams (137 for a tongue, 21 for a soul) transforms familiar ghost-story elements through precise, unexpected quantification.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Fresh synthesis of library-as-organism with time-folding through origami creates a non-obvious angle on memory preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The synthesis of loop pedal technology with exorcism ritual creates genuine freshness, transforming familiar possession tropes through specific mechanics of recorded silence and reversed assumptions. The demon speaking "only in assumptions" and the priest's vow to illuminate them before they become dogma offers a non-obvious angle on spiritual confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.7)
    The chronologically homesick fortune cookie writer mapping memories onto a nautilus shell offers fresh synthesis. The mirrored horizon as portal between temporal selves transforms a familiar time-travel concept through specific imagery. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and non-linear time pays off, though the fortune cookie writer aspect feels somewhat ornamental to the core action.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.7)
    Fresh synthesis of time-loop and architectural generation creates non-obvious stakes—the labyrinth as internal void rather than external maze. The "procedural generation" failing and forcing authentic choice transforms a familiar concept. Specific details like "seventh heartbeat" reset and "liquid light" warnings avoid generic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    The concept of backward-playing silence that unwinds numbness offers a fresh angle on healing through paradox. The specific synthesis of deafness, music teaching, and vibrational connection feels non-obvious. The ritual transformation avoids generic healing tropes through its particular logic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    The counterfeit emotion dealer premise offers fresh conceptual territory, particularly the idea of stolen, repackaged grief being recognized by its original owner. The transformation from dealer to vulnerable human feels earned, though the resolution trends toward expected emotional convergence rather than surprising insight.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    The mistaken letter as catalyst for expanding kindness offers a fresh angle on the paying-it-forward trope. The specific detail of shipping manifests as "stowaway kindnesses" shows originality.

Freshness serves meaning rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Combining music therapy, an eclipse, and a baby curl as talisman produces a fresh, specific synthesis; “dreaming roots” add a memorable, non‑generic texture.

    Transforms philanthropy tropes via volcanic setting and "translation" metaphor. Trapped bug light in glass is fresh closure image reweighting premise. Emotional specificity ("first genuine smile since fortune vanished") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Transformation of "cradle of sparks" from myth to tangible forge with brass birds avoids trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes. Specificity in "copper nib" and "seventeen clicks" creates freshness without quirk.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Transforms "cursed seer" trope via mathematical ritual specificity; tidal bluff setting avoids generic post-apocalypse. Risk-taking (frictionless world) heightens stakes but "precognitive" label slightly dilutes freshness. No derivative premise echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fresh synthesis of censorship/darkroom/astronomy tropes; "rarefy" action transforms premise with emotional specificity, though observatory setting lacks transformative novelty beyond expected metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Transforms dueling trope via needle cryptography and fencing-as-dialogue. The mechanical arm’s "fluid brutality" and sundial’s coded angles synthesize into fresh emotional logic, with risk-taking (overture as hidden staff) heightening stakes coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Transforms resistance trope through concrete mechanics: bus-ticket verses, coffee-tin seedpods, taxonomy of "revolt, tenderness, incandescence." Emotional truth in identity instability ("Anchor" as charm against vanishing). Fresh inflection: "origami grenades that carry only ink" redefines weaponry.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Fresh synthesis: film-reel time travel transformed through musical stakes ("rewriting departure into return"). Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence; "monochrome dress blooming into color" avoids cliché via specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Transforms memory tropes through visceral mechanics: petals carrying syllables, doubt as active preservation tool; "whale-rise tune" and shadow-weaving witnesses avoid quirky ornament by charging the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Transforms apology into tactile color theory via lace and compass, avoiding tropes through specific mechanics ("skip three airs, let the color of withheld kindness bloom"). The bonsai-as-ships metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric compression) heightening stakes without obscuring the closure’s quiet charge.
