    Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image: transformation through gentle guidance versus forceful spectacle. The final image of "revised stars" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Mara's quest for texture. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the scientist listening "with ribs" and the child finding a rhythm, avoiding any direct statement or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from potent, recurring images ("consent of doors," "cradle of sparks") rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of control vs. consent. The final lines ("speech will travel by hearthglow and patient angles") avoid moralizing, achieving earned thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme (promises, patterns, understanding as participation) emerges organically from concrete events and images (the rocks, the spiral, the dust's hunger), not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the promise now "breathed, a quiet engine," transforming grief into craft. It embraces complexity—rescue requires displacement, understanding demands becoming—without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the cartography of scars, refusing tidy morals and culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image reweights prior material without statement, offering a vision of painful but navigable healing through specific, earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of "turning questions into destinations," with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The philosophy worth steel as an address is earned, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the confluence of transience and preservation, anarchy and order. The core concept of a "blooming resistance" is a non-literal answer to this tension, achieved through the specific, earned image of poems fluttering on a twine line. Subtext is rich in gesture and image (e.g., the coffee tin's "cautious heart"). The ending avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, conceptual repricing of beauty as a practice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting direct statement. The final image of schedules "bowing" to the encore offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of fate versus agency. The broken clock and compasses are motifs that constrain choice and charge the closure without being token symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme (memory vs. erasure) emerges through specific images (seed recalling rain, conch echoing sentences) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the tree's leaf showing "village roofs intact again and self-correcting." Subtext operates in implication, e.g., "water forgets our shapes while remembering our salt."

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Resonance grows organically from parallel systems (greenhouse and pulsar), with dust and timing sheets reweighted at the end. A few lines edge toward thesis (“recovery is not a rescue but a rehearsal”), slightly over‑stating what the images already earn. Still, the final image (blown dust resettling) enacts the theme without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on pace and care beyond its frame.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Heat/cold, sound/silence, pause/pressure motifs braid into a coherent meditation on witness and making. The final image—fused ledger, dawn-readable, canyon as kiln of listening—reprices truth and craft without moralizing. Insights arise from particulars (gaps between names become routes). Thematic complexity holds without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: translation over elegy; wonder as disciplined attention; community reknit through non-sonic music. The refrains (“unshaken marvels,” “rectify”) reweight objects and images without becoming mere labels. One line edges toward thesis (“rectify our posture toward wonder”), but surrounding specifics earn it. The final carry-home image conceptually reprices the world’s “hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme (“rest is not surrender but location”) emerges organically from objects and acts—lens, catalog, code—without sermonizing. The ending reweights distress into staying, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext hums through the mantled stillness as sea-grief and institutional memory as salvation. No tidy moral; ambiguity remains in the accepted fracture and future storms.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of dignity, mutual aid, and anonymity accrue through particulars (one ring; “names of need, not gossip”; teens bearing bread and stories). Subtext flows in silences and procedures rather than pronouncements, with a slight but effective credo moment to anchor ethic. The bell’s reweighted meaning at the end provides a resonant, non‑literal answer. Sentiment is avoided by grounding in risk and labor.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres through particulars—the camera obscura, breath, viaduct, tear—rather than thesis. The central question (“where unused love is stored”) is answered through image and action (“wherever we resist the exhale”), then reweighted by the closing decanting. Subtext hums in the bridge’s “former footsteps” and communal breath with the passerby. Any explicit lines serve the earned metaphor and avoid sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Grief, memory, forgiveness, and time’s abrasion emerge organically through bridges, photographs, and the ring’s transformation. Subtext works in the tension between maze design and “articulate hesitation,” and in the father’s angle/circle dictum returning in the vault. One explicit line (“Forgiveness is a labyrinth too…”) skews declarative, but it’s well‑earned by preceding images. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rich thematic weave—liberation as service, resilience as common miracle, walls versus soil—that arises from concrete acts. Image systems (keys/notes, chain/vow, seeds/rumor) deepen subtext without heavy gloss. A few declaratives verge on thesis (“What she carries will impede famine”) but the closing images do the work. The final reconfiguration honors cost and communal handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Memory’s “impact” becomes operative, not decorative: saving the prelude reweights what shattering can erase. Motifs (absence, edges singing, aurora as battered marvel) accrue and then invert at the end without moralizing. The diver beat keeps complexity: grief’s architecture remains. The final charge—teaching others to hear the prelude—extends theme beyond self without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: jars, moonbeams, failed negatives, and the ethics of “stealing what day is already losing.” The ending reweights everything—light that “admits darkness”—without moralizing, offering a resonant answer about art as returning. The mentor’s failure grounds the insight, avoiding abstraction. One line (“You came, because…”) edges toward stating the thesis but is cushioned by scene pressure and image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme integrates through action and image: thaw as moral and material process; “safeness is not a wall” becomes operational in how he crafts vessels and space. Subtext in the bookmark and imagined technician reframes rules as care rather than constraint. A few lines verge on aphorism (“the purpose is to notice what hurts and make space”), but they’re earned by the preceding particulars. The final image reweights the premise without a didactic bow.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of identity, debt, and vulnerability accrue through concrete acts (cipher solving, unarmored apology) and recurring images (cast, seashell, stars). Subtext operates in the brother’s breadcrumbing and the cast-as-map motif. However, explicit thesis lines (“I wanted to prove that vulnerability is power, not weakness”) verge on moralizing, softening the implicit resonance. The final image still reweights prior material without full neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (“night speaks in lacunae”; mapping absence as solace/compass) arises from concrete acts (timing surf gaps, carving coordinates) rather than mere assertion. Final images reweight prior motifs (star as compass, text vs. stone, instrument not scripture), offering a resonant answer without moralizing. A few thesis‑ish lines (“reasons are sensations in costumes”) skate near declaration but are earned by scene pressure. The emotional aftertaste is gently profound rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: second chances as practice, thought as work and friction, meaning as amalgamation. Recurring images (broom bristles, notes/loops, frost/violin) deepen and reprice the premise at the end. The final stance offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. A few aphoristic lines flirt with statement, but remain earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—transparency and communal trust—emerges through images (lens, light, reflections, “ambiguously clear” proofs) rather than didactic statements. The ending reweights prior material: nonverbal proof and shared seeing restore a social contract (water oath). A single explicit line (“learning to be freed by honesty”) edges on stating the thesis, but it’s earned and supported by scene pressure. Resonance lingers in the charged quiet rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of mercy, stewardship, and reciprocity evolve through specific acts (planting a lie during drought, confession, revaluing marbles from prizes to witnesses). The “luck measurable” conceit integrates with ethics: metrics bow only after moral recalibration. Aphoristic lines risk neatness but feel earned by scene pressure (e.g., “fortune is a mirror” lands because it reweights the marbles and vine moment). The final equal‑standing image offers a resonant, non‑moralizing answer.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Listening, care versus proof, and time’s sidelong drift braid through recurring images (“hush of wings,” “icy warmth,” the lever) and culminate in a repricing of what counts as evidence. The choice to accept proof as affection rather than spectacle offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question. Subtext blooms in the withheld confession and the choir of “delayed selves.” No moralizing; the theme lingers with earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of silence as music, liminal spaces, and art as a means of release are earned through particulars (negative script, rests as choreography, stepping on reflections). The ending reweights the motif—“in between spaces” become “bridge”—without moralizing. Subtext of complicity (conductor beating time through drowning) lingers, reinterpreted by the narrator’s choice to “keep time for silence.” Resonance is deep and unsummarized.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of burden, witness, and “fault tolerance” emerge through specific images (isobars of grief, hinge of soot) rather than authorial statement. Recurring objects (gentian, scale) shift meaning at the end, offering a non‑literal answer: truth becomes lighter only when shared. Subtext in the oracle’s methods resists neat moralizing and honors complexity. The final “auroral sorrow” compass quietly reprices the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises from particulars: patterns versus belief, labor’s residue, and “normal means” as a moral weight. Recurring images (rosary beads, breath/pressure, metronome) accrue and are reweighted at closure. A few lines lean declarative (“Here was the truth no sermon could wash”), softening the subtextual purity. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme coheres through particulars: composting silence, mushrooms reordering text, and the swan’s folds recast maps as patience. The ending reweights the premise—listening as repair—without moralizing, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Subtext of authority versus humility (keeper who refuses the gavel) hums beneath actions. It’s rich, with no late, forced symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through action and motif repetition: ordinary magic as attention, grief re‑framed as wonder that keeps a question alive. The “wondering is a form of love” line edges toward statement but is earned by the linked images (wheat curl, question mark, iron moon of loss humming). Resonance lingers without a tidy fix. Minor aphoristic phrasing tempers the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of displacement, listening as ethics, and custody of memory emerge through particulars (dragons circling a spindle; rooms waking in terror; maps belonging in the dark until asked). The final commitment reweights the premise: if dreams ended, testimony and inter‑wall speech must replace them. No moralizing; resonance arises from image and role acceptance. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection on who holds stories when sleepers are gone.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of communal complicity, mercy in exposure, and arrangement over revelation emerge from particulars, not pronouncement. The final line “see what you have done” elegantly reweights agency and responsibility. Recurring images (light, fortunes, water/flow) accrue meaning and shift at the end without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on power and truth-telling with earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of consent, language as instrument, grief-bargains, and listening over spectacle are integrated through concrete acts (looping absence; rhetorical inquiry; the palette’s refusal to mirror lies). The parable of key/lock/necklace reframes avoidance and hinges, returning as Mara reclaims her name. No moral is stated; resonance arises from particulars and the final recalibration of the street. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: listening as creation, breath as score, time’s ache transfigured into patience. The nautilus, mirrored horizon, and fortunes recur with shifting meaning; the ending reweights prior material without moralizing. The “instructions for breath” insight feels earned by on-page practice and restraint. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of relinquishment and re‑patterning emerge through image and action, not lecture. The “do not outrun what follows you” inscription risks directness but is earned by the procedural quest and is reweighted by the final renunciation. Recurring images (drop/ripple, darkening brightness) shift meaning at the end. The piece invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme—listening backward to move forward; silence as conduit rather than void—emerges organically through action and object (needle, drum) rather than thesis. Recurring images (frost, tide, filament, hush) reprice themselves in the ending without moralizing. The final stance resists applause‑chasing, privileging tenderness and presence, a resonant answer to the opening fear. Ambiguity is purposeful, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: weather vs. institutional control, integrity as practice, maps as moral terrain. Subtext in the official’s “care” rhetoric and the narrator’s refusal (“I refuse poor maps”) resists binaries. The final repricing—“Integrity is a barometer too”—risks slight explicitness, but it’s earned by prior images and lands as a resonant answer. The pigeon/dot/pressure rise sequence deepens the moral weather.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic arc (memory as present current rather than past visitation) emerges through event and image—UV revelation, the flower’s vapor, the vial’s revaluation. Subtext moves in objects and procedures (archiving a tear, “science has hands that tremble for different reasons”). A few explicit statements skirt thesis-making but are earned by the moment. The final compass image reframes prior motifs without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars—patterns, layers, the rope’s reprisal—rather than thesis, though the vow risks mild explicitness. The piece interrogates progress, mercy, and playful ethics via tactile images (river’s “impossible choices,” silt’s transformations). The final image reweights the mile markers as letters, aligning voice, concept, and ethic without sentimentality. Resonance lingers with plausible counter-readings about choice vs. acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: incompletion as communal practice; repair via direction rather than glue; tradition adapted without fire. The ending offers a non‑literal answer—the “map” of unfinished places and footprints as ongoing song—without moralizing. Recurring images (bowl, hush, shipwreck timbers, seeds) accrue meaning and shift at closure. No sermonizing; the “magnificent simplicity” credo feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme coheres: half-truths as ethical carriers, maps vs pulse, counterfeit guiding toward authentic feeling. Subtext operates in the static “braille,” the herd misreading heat as water, and the petal’s curl. One thesis-leaning line (“Not truth as purity, but truth as motion”) skates close to statement but is earned by particulars. The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—attention as an ethical act and compassion as cyclical—is earned through specific exchanges (fee waived → demurrage forgiven; locket → granddaughter’s arrival → public gratitude). Subtext hums in images (gulls falling quiet, the ledger as “harbor music”) without overt moralizing. The final promise reframes the harbor’s sounds as a shared duty, a conceptual repricing rather than a neat lesson. No late motif grabs; the symbols are seeded and pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of community as practiced posture (not symbol) emerges from particulars: ear sculpture, listening walk, seam/“Together,” living arbor, shards as “teeth.” The final vow and glowing ache offer a resonant, non‑literal answer about belonging through ongoing tending rather than cure. Subtext flourishes in image and gesture rather than exposition. Complexity remains (not healed, forgiveness contingent on leaning again).

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around patience vs. control, observation vs. creation, and art’s debt to time. The interrupted cadence becomes an ethics: almost‑ending that chooses to begin and then to release. Final strokes “to guide returners” reprice the act as stewardship rather than capture. No moralizing; resonance emerges from charged images and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres through particulars: ambiguous loss, math as ritual craft, and attention/time/uncertainty/return as a lived equation. The “cracked theorem” risks explicitness but is earned by the mosaic method and not presented as moral. The final image recasts grief as carried practice—conceptual repricing that lingers. Subtext moves in images (rope of light, pendulums) rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of service‑as‑visibility and presence without gaze emerges organically from objects and choices (tape, caches, arrows, ducts). The final consideration—“how visibility might be crafted from service”—reprices the premise without moralizing. Sense memory as practice (not abstraction) carries subtext about care, labor, and legacy. The mother/daughter retrieval refracts the vow into a resonant, humane answer.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: care as subtraction, listening beyond command, and courage rehearsed in “small bends.” Subtext lives in plant “treaties” and the ledger of non‑interference; the final image reweights the premise without over‑explaining. Slight deduction for explicit thesis lines in the hall speech, which border on moralizing even if grounded by scene. The ending’s vow returns the motifs with felt, unsentimental resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Exchange, treaty, and memory are woven through concrete acts (“Color is a kind of treaty,” heirlooms for passage, releasing the “tiny held storm”). The ending reweights prior material—sleep returns, pact carries—without moralizing. Subtext hums in the mother’s apparition and the cost of letting the gnat go. The piece invites reflection on what restitution can bear after collective harm.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the cave magnifies “everyday magic” through a baker’s breath, not wizardly heroics; the guide’s failure becomes the community’s gain. The final cloak of “bright darkness” answers the central question with a revaluation of listening as power. A single explicit thesis line (“Not the heroics of wizards…”) edges toward tell, but most resonance is earned via image and action. Ambiguity remains humane and pointed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of return, practice vs monument, and absence as a navigable structure emerge through concrete acts (tapping, mapping fog, circling “here”s, “we will ask bakers/pigeons/boats”). Subtext is strong: communal repair through rhythm, not ceremony; the woman’s weather-for-name layers erasure and identity. A few explicit lines (“the harbor deserves not mood but structure”) flirt with didacticism but feel voice-motivated. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of attention and the cost of control; patterns that preserve also imprison. Recurring images reweight at the end (arrows braid into invitations; maps folded past borders), providing a resonant, non‑literal answer. No moralizing—insights arise from on‑page acts and prices paid. The final reset reframes habit vs new start without neat absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: discipline vs. mysticism, patterns as bridges for grief, kindness as rigor. The “unheard symphony” is made audible by process, not proclamation, culminating in the charged room and the dawn balance. A few aphoristic lines (“Discipline is how the unheard symphony...”) skate close to statement but stay earned by scene. The ending reweights earlier images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of parting-as-infrastructure and witness-as-tribute emerge from concrete actions (payments; the corridor’s architecture) and recur with images (roads, doors, thunder). The final repricing is resonant and nonliteral, though the explicit line “goodbye is not a door closing; it is the blueprint of the next room” borders on a thesis statement, trimming subtlety. Subtext in Lio’s near‑forgiveness and the curse’s revised appetite adds nuance. The work avoids sentimentality and leaves meaningful aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of honest exchange versus fraud accrues through ledger, ink, and the “inverse function” motif, with a resonant repricing at the end. A couple of lines verge on overt statement (“If I write, I must write the truth”), but they remain anchored in action. The final image (cleaning warmth, ink‑moon’s tide) deepens questions of fairness without sermonizing. Subtext—camera theatre, sponsors’ “invisible passport of touch”—does strong work.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Resonant inquiry into truth as function (“invented histories” that bear weight) emerges through concrete practice rather than sermon. The motif net (hum, gold edges, refracted light, bonsai patience) coheres and reweights at the end. A couple of direct statements (“Invented histories are not false…”) skim the edge of over‑explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of bureaucratic fiction vs. lived memory, commerce repainting mourning, and erased histories being shipped and inventoried arise through objects and actions, not moralizing. Recurring images (label, tides, containers) reweight meaning at the end. The piece resists tidy resolution; the final choice reframes identity as a perpetual, costly listening. Subtext hums in the widow’s tremor and the clerk’s exit.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant motifs (shell/compass, crooked bow, laughter vs straight lines) develop a coherent inquiry into truth, failure, and kindness. However, the explicit thesis line—“It was never about certainty, … but about kindness…”—edges into stated moral, dulling subtext. The imagery otherwise earns the insight and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (prosperity vs memory; choreography as civic ethics) emerges through images and tactics rather than lecture. The chip reweights heritage as functional power, not nostalgia, and the final harmony line reframes hope as disciplined risk. One thesis‑leaning line (“prosperity without memory…”) brushes the edge of didacticism but is earned by context. Ambiguity remains: victory is seasonal, consent contested.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres through watchkeeping, extinction, and the ambivalence of the space age: “it maps the night, and then it writes its name across the map.” Recurring motifs (hourglass grain, timed flames, hush) reweight at the end—archive versus breath—without moralizing. The mother/Nightwatch thread deepens the ethic of witness, not rescue. The final line reframes value: proof and image are finite; only breath/hush truly persists.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Repair as vow, translation as love, and craft-guided trust thread through particulars (copper braid, bowls, Morse on the wrist). The piece resists moralizing; subtext—intimacy between human, tool, and place—emerges through action. The final “depot smiles” reprises the theme of communion and oversight reframed as mutual regard. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of listening over imposing and the ethics of naming arises organically from tasks and images (glass “teaches,” the falcon as clerk, rivers “voting”). The ending reweights prior motifs with the insight that beginnings carry the cost of future partings. No sermonizing; resonance comes via concrete objects and the earned pause. The conceptual repricing is quiet but potent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: balance as practice, not decree; listening as civic act; repair through shared rhythm. Recurring images (fork, archway, feet, windows) reprice meaning in the ending without moralizing. The line “not by decree, but by walking the measure they made together” risks explicitness but is anchored in action and avoids sermonizing. The final communal “answer” reframes silence and absence into a living covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from action: harnessing the ephemeral (scent, hush, prayer) to make rescue tangible; science and reverence in tension but ultimately in synthesis. The vial’s memory‑touch reframes rescue as coaxing meaning from what resists capture, culminating in “collected silence.” The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: survival depends on attention, stillness, and re‑tuning the world’s hush. Ambiguity lingers productively (sacred vs. acoustic, memory vs. signal).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: from sugar‑sweet warnings to iron truth to “brine of a promise kept,” the piece reframes truth as disciplined listening. Recurring images (lens, lattice, hush, reef teeth) reweight at the end without moralizing. The inheritance of false alarms is repriced by the final, segmented light metaphor—truth delivered in beams. Ambiguity remains purposeful, deepening resonance rather than evading consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of vow, debt, and memory ripen through concrete acts (grafts “remembered their marriages,” salt of stars in fruit). The final answer—“the orchard waking to sing”—reweights names, commerce, and possession without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful (identity across lives) yet not vague; resonance lingers through the charged object and kept vow. No thematic sermon replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of remaking precedent through communal attention and ceremony surface through concrete acts (tether of names along the pier, shared sleep‑routes). The final image reweights the premise toward care rather than conquest (“not to take, but to tend”). One line edges into thesis‑speak (“shared precedent remade us brave”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Interrupted journeys” evolves from image to ethic (returning objects, aligning time to the guide) and culminates in “walking with time” rather than arresting it. The sundial’s restoration reframes faith as practice and attention, not belief—an earned, image‑led answer. One explicit line (“I understood that faith could be rebuilt...”) skirts telling but is earned by the preceding enactment. Subtext in elders’ braided prayers and Sami’s grammar remark deepens the thematic weave.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Identity, time, and the ethics of medium emerge organically through tactile acts and recurring images (margins, ear, surface mail). The ending offers a resonant answer: choose listening and patience over speed, reweighting past and present without moralizing. The “Auricle”/ear seal crystallizes the listener theme. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and safety without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of truth masked as jest, rumor as navigation, and complicity under authoritarian rehearsal cohere through image rather than thesis. Recurring motifs (jester hat, knots eased not cut, eternal candle, adjacent corridors) reweight meaning at the end. The piece resists moralizing; the final watch image quietly answers the question of what a “fool” must bear. Subtext—survival by laughter and the cost of hearing—runs under the overt action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of listening vs. self-protective wanting, apology as practiced attention, and healing as legible surface accrue through concrete motifs (shard, fog-script, hinge). The “let your wanting be small” line toes the edge of stating the thesis, but is diegetically earned via the glass. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: not deciding becomes an ethical stance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—translation as an ethics of holding rain without drowning—emerges through coral/cast/boats motifs rather than lecture. Subtext operates in the child’s “Also Us,” the smudged inks, and the fog‑as‑treaty, culminating in the understated “we brought ourselves.” One explicit mission line risks thesis‑speak, but it’s backed by enacted choices. The resonance lingers without neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of communal authorship, memory as weight, and art as a medium of reparative light emerge through concrete acts (projecting onto fog; ceding interpretation to locals). The pomegranate shard’s “laughter has weight” line reweights the method and final applause without moralizing. The ending reframes joy as a shared practice and leaves a charged plan, avoiding tidy answers. Subtext hums in gestures (clapping “because the crows had taught us manners”).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of certainty vs. curiosity and “nested awakenings” emerge from concrete acts (tapping echoes to bewitch binder) rather than abstract statement. Recurring images (coin/star, parabolas, pauses) shift meaning and culminate in “now you are mapping the air,” a reweighting of the premise. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: a charged compromise that honors memory without sterilizing it. No sermonizing; ambiguity remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Language as communal act versus commodified cognition is dramatized, not preached; motifs (bees, chitin, gourds, “choir”) accrue and reprice the premise at the end. The clause‑as‑song fuses law and art, making subtext legible through image and act. One near‑overt line (“Choir is a word…”) skirts statement but feels in‑voice and earns its place. The closing “A garden keeps the spark, and we keep watch” resonates as communal endurance rather than moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: insomnia as vigilance, pain photosynthesized, a treaty between wounds and hands. The postcard and shell are reweighted by the end (living atlas; sorrow‑lanterns), offering a non‑literal answer about mercy and attention as devotion. No moralizing; resonance accrues through image and action. Ambiguity remains meaningful—rest is gentled, not cured.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of stewardship vs. romantic reunion is earned through concrete acts: “our work is not romance but stewardship of breath.” The ending reweights prior motifs (names, jars of dust, moorings) into a philosophy of care with quiet, durable consequence. Subtext about memory’s economy and the ethics of witnessing accrues without moralizing. The final grace note and moon “coins” pay the thematic debt elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: truth needs accompaniment; trust as choreography rather than monument. Recurring musical and archival motifs reweight at the end without sermonizing; the “suite of promises” becomes shared authorship. A single explicit thesis line (“Trust... not a monument but a choreography”) risks being on‑the‑nose, but the surrounding scene earns it. The final image reconfigures the premise with resonance and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—compassion as code, fairness as engineering—emerges from particulars (adhesive analysis, song‑logging) and recurs without heavy sermonizing. The ending reweights the premise: mercy must be encrypted, then made legible to the willing. A few explicit lines (“So let compassion move as code…”) flirt with stating the thesis but feel voice‑true. Subtext around forbidden love and civic risk deepens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of preservation versus vulnerability accrues through action (paper trails, feathered couriering) rather than thesis. The meteorite chip’s reweighting—calibrating doubt, then becoming the choir’s “night piece”—elegantly reframes trust. One line edges toward stating the theme (“Trust returns across learning to trust again”), but the surrounding images keep it earned. The final charge holds complexity: blooming/withering coexisting, mercy without amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme (“necessary distances,” sacred thresholds) emerges from concrete acts—reading weather codes in wood, the seam’s function, the refusal to descend. The line “It is not doors that are holy…” risks baldness but is earned by prior particulars and is reweighted by the closing image. The final stance answers the central question without moralizing. Resonance lingers with plausible ambiguity about the father and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: belonging as reciprocal rhythm rather than possession, earned through listening and timing. Recurring images (constellations, breath, feather, dawn) reweight at the end without didacticism. One explicit line (“I realized that belonging is a rhythm…”) edges toward telling but is largely earned by the prior scene. The piece invites reflection on consent and home without flattening to a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: revision as care, language of land, trust in disappearance. Recurring images (seeds as punctuation, glass as memory) shift meaning at the end to affirm responsible detour. A few aphoristic lines risk neatness but are earned by scene work. The final image carries quiet resonance without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of grief’s diagonal motion, luck as curated attention, and art as civic rehearsal arise organically from action and image. “Objects are not souvenirs until they learn the hand they belong to” reweights possession, memory, and performance without sermonizing. The final cadence conceptually reprices the work: connection, not applause, is the economy. A hair shy of 9+ only due to the gentleness of its ambiguity; no line lapses into moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (memory as resistance; negative space as meaning) arises from action, not thesis, with the “between” motif reinterpreted in the shoulder‑sky and final vocation claim. The law’s urge to erase is answered by intimate, unarchivable art—conceptual repricing rather than moralizing. The cartographer’s line (“Your departures, my returns…”) crystallizes distance‑as‑language. No late symbolic convenience; the images earn their resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of labor, community memory, and the ethics of clarity arise from particulars (scarred ferry boards as benches; tide maps etched in glass). Noctilucent “reckonings” reframes wonder as debt, subtly guiding the protagonist’s patience ethic. A couple of sentences flirt with thesis-stating (“This is how…”), but the final image returns the light to townspeople without a neat moral. Resonance lingers as an earned revaluing of the ordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete acts: translation, repair, and witness as alternatives to erasure or apology. Recurring images—box, paper chain, bargain—shift meaning at the end from debt to pathway. Subtext runs through gesture and diction (her checking his hands before the box; his “cracked cup” voice). No moralizing; the plan to teach sky‑songs extends resonance without tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: hope as calibrated practice, buoyancy with ballast, communal pattern over solitary prayer. The key reweighting (“not superstition… but calibration”) toes the line of explicitness but is supported by concrete ritual and object logic. Recurring images (spiral, isobars, tide/gauge) shift meaning at the end. Resonance lingers without didactic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Legacy, guilt, climate grief, and listening as citizenship emerge organically through object/action (negative, hopscotch, letter), not through moralizing. The final “map of future footfalls” answers the piece’s question with a non‑literal, resonant ethic of attention and return. Recurrences (ivy, echoes, diaries, tide) are reweighted at the end. Ambiguity is meaningful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of possibility vs. defeat, discipline vs. desire to command, and ethical futurity (coaxing, not stealing) emerge organically from actions. The borrowed heartbeat’s integration reframes identity and agency without platitude. The final guidance—“ask a friend to stay for tea”—is scene-earned and reweights prior images (hush, bells, parapet) without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: futures shown are ordinary, which deepens rather than softens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through enacted rituals and images, not mere assertion: work as redemption, memory made portable, violence made less proud. The final pledge reframes justice as shared future maintenance, avoiding neat absolutes while carrying cost. A few aphoristic lines risk overstatement, but they are earned by scene pressure and imagery (“bitter bouquet,” “patience was our armor”). Subtext in offerings (olive branches and lockpicks) enriches moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—philanthropy as machinery of erasure versus the ethics of preserving echoes—emerges via action, not thesis. Recurring images (echo, cracks, lace of fingerprints, manufactured weather) reweight at the end; “not alive, but audible, and forgivable” is earned by the ritual’s cost. Ambiguity remains (near‑forgiveness vs. persistent guilt) without moralizing. The final rain reframes his project as altar‑building rather than absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of discipline vs. desire, conformity vs. truth, and voice redistribution arise organically from ritual action and object use. The “harvest of echoes” becomes literal and political, with a resonant reweighting in the last lines (the city learning to refuse and still sing). No moralizing intrudes; ambiguity remains about consequences. Recurring motifs shift meaning rather than merely repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (“who bears cost in our art?”) emerges via concrete acts: reversed strings, stick rule, punchlines re‑aimed at power. Recurring images (hush, ribs, vellum, stick) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing; the no‑applause close is resonant and unsentimental. A few direct statements (“if we meant to explore ethical storytelling…”) skate close to thesis but are earned by proximate action. The conceptual repricing is clear and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: ephemeral signals versus official forgetting, cadence versus interruption, and care for “overlooked histories.” The monarch/moth/heartbeat motifs reweight at the end without neat moralizing. A few explicit claims (“I was not summoning magic; I was asking for witness…”) tip toward statement but stay integrated. The closing poise invites reflection with credible complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Forgiveness, memory as breath, and ethical craft emerge through particulars (misdelivered bell; choosing to let air “say them”). The final cadence reweights the opening promise: beyond forgiving, the mandate is “stay, cast, listen, and begin again.” No sermonizing; images carry the argument. Counter‑readings (craft as penitential ritual) deepen without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: decaying authority, consent, and agency reframed (“directives decay into invitations”). The final act reweights the premise without moralizing, answering the central question through image—opening the door as chosen reciprocity with the path. Motifs (wafer, lung, map/eels) shift meaning at the end. A couple of aphoristic lines flirt with statement, but they’re earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres as faith through meticulous attention, not spectacle; “empirically ironic” devotion is earned through concrete acts. Recurring images (wires, sums, dusk/note) shift meaning at the end into a quiet sacrament of maintenance. One slightly on‑the‑nose line (“People will call it superstition…”) edges toward statement, but the closing image restores resonance. The conceptual cost—choosing stewardship over grandeur—lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of mercy, absence, and the arithmetic of what’s unsung emerge through images (broken pin, factory dust on the mother’s hand, belts carrying breath) rather than thesis statements. The ending reweights prior material: carrying the mute box as a compass reframes silence as guidance, not lack. No moralizing; resonance lingers as conceptual repricing of “grace” and “forgiveness.” The subtext of debt/ledger versus mercy integrates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of boundary, care vs capture, and brokenness as instruction emerge organically through objects and action. The final reweighting (“not to trap, but to teach holding”) resonates back through mirrors, sextant, and orchard. Symbolic recurrence (“glass mountains,” bees) stays grounded rather than didactic. Ambiguity remains meaningful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: shedding vows as a model for grief, repair, and generational handoff. Subtext lives in images (misread psalter valued over perfect scripture; hair ribbon knot “like an answer”). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—persistence and patience—without moralizing, charging prior motifs. “Accidental wisdom” doubles as earned stance, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: inquiry as lineage, agency vs complicity, and “nonlinear inheritance” reframed as choosing what answers when the world asks you to speak. Recurring images (cameo, pages, bathrooms) accrue meaning and reweight the final stance (“curate the between”). No moralizing; the aunt’s unfinished eyes carry charged ambiguity. The resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme integrates through action and image: rescuing misfiled fates evolves into rescuing a person and then oneself via kind failure. The traveler’s line risks thesis‑statement territory but is enacted rather than summarized, and the uncorrected whispers concretize it. The seeds of neglected questions rooting into the aisles reweight prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, leaving space for reflection on error, memory, and gentler futures.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of memory, permission versus pigment, and identity’s price emerge through recurring images that reweight at the end. The “leaves… spelt nothing, which was everything” offers a non‑literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in the chimera twin/voice dynamic deepens the question of selfhood. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of absence as relational measure and “clear complexity” are embodied in rope‑work, catalog numbers, and the ledger’s restoration. The final image reweights the premise (bridges as doors that learned to stay), though a few direct statements (“Absence… is not emptiness,” “Absence… becomes a bridge”) verge on moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in his omission of the door from the note. Strong resonance, slightly dampened by explicit thesis lines.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of coexistence, restraint, and craft as care emerge organically through image patterns (ice script, corridors as bells, hush as “rooms”). The final realization reweights the premise: survival is a negotiated quiet, not expulsion. A near‑thesis line risks explicitness, but it sits within scene pressure and avoids sermonizing. The “hammered repose” motif modulates from concept to lived practice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of coincidence as stitch, memory as communal infrastructure, and belonging emerge through concrete acts (map exchange, shard insertion, beam’s hum). Final images reweight prior motifs without needing plot summary. A couple of lines verge on thesis‑voice (“This was not coincidence as shrug...,” “grammar of belonging”), slightly reducing the subtlety. Overall, resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of collective versus individual memory emerges through concrete acts, not sermonizing; the plum memory revalues the archive. Recurring images (shadows, quill, forecourt, hush) shift meaning at the end to imply a nuanced ethic: “both binder and page.” The piece avoids tidy moralizing, allowing cost and complexity to linger. The final hush-as-answer is an earned, non-literal thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of play as prayer, filtering fear like fuel, and persuading gravity emerge through concrete action. Recurring images (note in mosaic, rag knot, hush) reprice the ending without moralizing. The final green hush reframes the world’s weight with earned ambiguity. A single on‑the‑nose line (“This play was our prayer”) still supports rather than explains.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—hinges, seams, littorals, and how attention alters time—without collapsing into a sermon. The final reconfiguration (“naming passage” and carrying the coast inland) reweights earlier motifs with emotional consequence. One or two near‑thesis lines skate close to explicitness but remain grounded in image and action. Resonance lingers with the star‑fed hinge and shared migration.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: safety vs. hospitality, walls vs. openings, quiet as presence not absence. The final image reweights prior material—“safe like stepping into a room you have never left”—without moralizing, and the redraw of entrances concretizes the thematic turn. Subtext hums in gestures (xenial, arches, widened landings) and avoids tidy binaries. The pursuit of “home” arrives as a repricing rather than a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as shaped presence rather than absence, grief as something to be held by air. Recurring images (storm glass, whistle’s echo, transit) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The stairwell pause image elegantly reframes the goal of “making a room of the gap.” Resonance lingers without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: stewardship over sovereignty, memory over possession, ascent as relational inversion. Recurring images (apples/messages, the ruby lens, murals) reweight at the end into “seeds we could finally plant,” a quiet conceptual repricing. The oath risks didacticism, but is diegetic and anchored in action, not sermon. The final charged poise—an empty throne with a living city—lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of stewardship, boundaries, mercy, and ethical leaving arise from particulars (ash as proof, ring as cold promise, lighthouse image) rather than declaration. Subtext runs through action—teaching to breathe mirrors the narrator’s own held ache; “mercy is how thresholds learn to hold” caps a practice earned on the page. The ending reweights prior material: the lesson’s proof is her not looking back. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Promises, responsibility, and value creation are integrated through concrete acts rather than stated morals. The “quantum promise” transforms from jargon to lived ethic, reframing debt and trust; the ledger dissolving into breath elegantly reweights all prior material. Ambiguity persists (what is the ongoing cost of such vows?) without confusion. The ending’s generosity (charity delivery) complicates “value” beyond profit.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: power as famine, mercy as retreat, listening as governance; silence and resonance become ethics. Recurring images (golden shadows, the crank, ash letters) shift meaning at the end, revaluing authority as stewardship. The ancestral confession risks moralizing, yet because it’s diegetic and materially earned by ritual, it plays as subtext embodied in action. The final vow reweights the initial shame into a charged, costly mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: allegiance redefined from war to tending, art/science syncretism, inheritance via the mother’s program. The final act reweights prior images (stage, orchard, stars) into a non‑literal answer about possibility and care over conquest. No moralizing; resonance rides image and cost. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece earns its themes—how institutions mute kindness, how attention can be an ethical act—through particulars (bus tokens → cookies, stroller bolts refused payment). Subtext lives in dust patterns as language and the two sets of prints as a dialogue across time. One line flirts with thesis (“we pretend is sky”), but the final images avoid sermonizing and reweight the premise. The button and corridor reframe “unknown” without tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme (resisting curated erasure) emerges organically through objects, action, and code, not lecture. Motifs reweight at the end (“reappear,” “hinge,” “map”), offering a non‑literal answer: coded freedom via endurance and connection rather than spectacle. The mother’s aphorism risks aphoristic neatness but is grounded by concrete soundscape and the linked act. The final image reframes history as circuitry and listening, lingering beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Art as defense, secrecy as garment, and law’s threadbare sanction interweave without sermonizing. The “vested hush” evolves from concept to ethic, reframed at the end by the ring of absence—protection as sustained erasure. The teacher’s ash‑scented memory and the sax as amulet deepen the moral ambiguity (preservation vs. occlusion). The final cadence invites reflection without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of listening-as-stewardship and memory’s architecture matures through action (cairns humming, leaves choosing neighbors) rather than thesis alone. The final repricing—“the hearer, never the leaf”—reweights earlier images without sermonizing, linking craft to ethical duty. Folklore-as-conversation vs. judgment enacts a humane stance without false equivalence. Resonance lingers in the idea of grounded prophecy averting rumor.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme (fidelity to living irregularity over sterile exactness) emerges organically via craft actions and tools, with the admiral’s journal reframing coincidence into pattern. The water clock is a strong non-literal answer that reweights earlier beats. However, explicit thesis statements in the final lines (“planning could be friendship,” “befriend uncertainty”) edge into moralizing, softening subtext. The resonance remains substantial despite the telliness.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: balance between proof and wonder, the ethics of measured remembrance, and the mass of names. Recurring images (seam, scales, coin, rain) reweight meaning at the end without didactic moralizing. The insight about limits and redemption arises from concrete acts, not thesis statements. The closing acceptance resonates beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of mercy, brokenness as instrument, and laughter as bridge arise through concrete acts (crooked harp, cracked laugh, tooth‑as‑compass) rather than commentary. The line “laughter is a key” risks thesis, but it’s dramatized and then tested, earning its place. The final image reweights the world’s rules: he tends laughter, not ownership; cost is solitude and ongoing duty. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of calibration versus punishment, instruments versus human agency, emerges through concrete acts (breath‑math, boundary knot). A few explicit thesis lines (“penance is not punishment; it is calibration”) edge toward telling, slightly reducing subtext. Nonetheless, the final charged poise reweights earlier images without neat moralizing. The mercy threshold as a geometric rule is a resonant thematic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of restitution through attention and naming emerges organically from acts, not thesis statements; “only a witness paid in awakenings” is earned, not sermonized. The final image (sailcloth name tied, scene no longer drowning in anonymity) reweights the entire premise. Subtext hums in the painter’s deflection (“only texture”) and the narrator’s ethical counter. Ambiguity lingers without confusion—the cost of carrying histories is felt but not fully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically: time as currency, honesty enforced by gravity, ceilings as vaults of concealed debts. The barrel’s repricing of hours and the final refusal of the fluorescent to revive provide a resonant, non‑didactic answer. “Some debts should be carried… then turned into stories that spend themselves” lands as earned wisdom rather than moral. The cracked smile’s change reframes facade and truth without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through action: perfection is a seductive weight; survivable life requires negotiated wobble. The mother’s completed sentence within the frozen circle reweights grief and purpose without sermonizing. A few aphoristic lines (“all awakenings must rustle…”) skim close to explicit moral, but they’re grounded in the scene’s material logic. The final law resonates as an earned answer rather than a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of ornament as solidarity and song as archive emerge organically through procedures and public ritual, not sermonizing. The shard’s “breath marks” and the mirror ritual generate subtext about communal authorship and the ethics of looking. The ending reweights the premise—revision not as apology but as ornament—while holding ambivalence (“My revolution remained defunct”). Resonance lingers beyond plot without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around truth, attention, and repair over ownership; “mending what isn’t torn” shifts from technique to ethic by the end. The tethering of light to listening reweights power relationships in a resonant, nonliteral way. One line skirts moralizing (“dawn is a borrowed instrument… noticing the quiet around other people’s pain”), slightly on-the-nose but supported by prior action. Subtext largely lives in image and choice (patina vs. decay; shadow as collateral).

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: the failure of explanations as an ethic, reweighted into love/courage through the father revelation and the scarf. Recurring images (hinges, hush, jars, compass) accrue meaning and shift at the end without moralizing. The final lesson is understated yet felt: endurance and attention as courage. No platitudes; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of patient joining vs. blunt haste is dramatized through materials, technique, and alliances across time; images shift meaning at the end. Subtext hums in the grandmother/future girl coalition and the gate “through, not out.” A couple of explicit articulations (“not magic for spectacle”) flirt with telling but don’t undercut the resonance. The final vow reweights the premise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes—night as revelation, courtship with the unseen, translation of sense into meaning—emerge from particulars (glass layers, moths, scent channels). Subtext accrues without over-explaining, and the ending reweights the premise with the “doors” image. Minor ding: the grandmother’s line edges toward explicit thesis in the final beat, flirting with thematic echo. Even so, the resonance lingers and feels earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of memory, accountability, and the ethics of record emerge through concrete acts, not thesis—“a testimony is a bridge that cannot be unbuilt.” Recurring images (lagoon, debris, punches) accrue meaning and reprice the city’s past at the end. The piece resists moral neatness by insisting on cost over comfort. The final image invites expansive reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (labor, accountability, and community as the antidote to exhausted miracles) emerges through concrete acts and objects, crescendoing in the bottle-as-clock. A few lines edge toward didactic (“reimagine an entire civilization”), but they’re earned by the scene’s work. The final ticking reweights earlier images without stating a moral. Subtext breathes in choices like “no gods were named” and disputes danced before debated.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—ethics of witnessing and the mercy of omission—emerges from concrete ritual and objects, not thesis. The quince/orchard and wax‑oath apparatus recur to reweight meaning; the ending’s “blessing… that only describes weather, not fate” reframes the vocation. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without confusion, inviting reflection on accountability and prophecy. No moralizing: insight is earned through the specific, costly refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: inheritance as pattern‑memory rather than property, keeping by “decreasing entropy” through song. Recurring images (cap, frost maps, breath, doors in pits) reweight at the end without moralizing. The grandmother’s line risks explicitness but lands as earned transmission, not thesis. The final act reframes time as something to be borrowed and returned, resonating beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of restraint vs. panic and listening as ethical practice emerge organically from concrete acts (splicing rope, reading micro-variations, ringing bell). The final repricing (“switch our posture”) resonates and reweights earlier motifs. A couple of on-the-nose lines risk didacticism, but subtextual images (ferryman, geese echo) keep the piece from moralizing. The blessing-bell coda sustains ambiguity while feeling earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: maintenance as devotion, attention as action, damage as shape. The lantern/wiping/polishing motif reframes “erasing” into “guidance,” with the ending reweighting prior images (spared collision). One near-thesis line risks overtness, but it feels earned by scene work. Subtext with the dead engineers/ghosts deepens without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: witness versus complicity, language’s gentleness as earned future, archives that “teach the world to listen.” Recurring images (bees, glass, covenant) shift meaning at the end from preservation to kiln—an elegant conceptual repricing. No moralizing; the final blue road offers a charged, non-literal answer about approach without words. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars (tolerable stings, stripe of blue).

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: time recast as texture, communal ritual as measure, memory as metronome. The urn fragment/loop/cricket reprise reweights earlier images without moralizing. The final gesture (“follow the soft thunder”) offers a resonant answer to the central question. Ambiguity lingers productively, with no didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of tending the torn and beauty in incompletion emerge organically through actions (tying ribbon, raft, final restraint). A few lines edge toward explication (“He means the mornings...”), but the ending wisely lets “ink say less than silence,” preserving subtext. Recurring images (weave, hush, water) reweight at closure without a stated moral. Emotional aftereffect lingers as acceptance rather than cure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: “architectural secrets” repriced as relationships, stewardship as listening, legacy as shared practice. Subtext breathes in images (otter ramps, shell offerings, mushrooms’ “white alphabet”) rather than statements. The final trust‑silence reframes death and labor without moralizing. Ambiguity remains productive and moving, inviting reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through concrete motifs—patience as conductor, valence and catalysts, convergence versus nostalgia—culminating in a resonant repricing of “home.” The explicit line “home is a rate constant” risks didactic tilt but is supported by prior images (amber, basin, rain), so it lands as distilled thesis rather than sermon. Subtext around ritual and science maintains complexity without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Listening versus conquest, translation as care, and the ethics of repair emerge organically from acts and images. “Submerged concord” is not a thesis but a lived practice culminating in the lattice-as-surrender and the harbor’s “treaty tightening.” The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers (ghosts are quieted, not erased). Resonance feels earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motifs (scars/grooves, wheels/voices, distance as lens) accrue and reweight at the end; the riddle’s answer and the copper crow’s “voice” resonate. One line veers toward thematic explicitness (“distance is not a wall but a lens”), but the final understanding re‑grounds in image and action. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing elsewhere, with earned wisdom arising from scrap‑world particulars. Emotional aftereffect is quiet and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres through object and act: navigation, memory’s unreliability, and chosen ground evolve into a non‑literal answer at the end. The applique’s redefinition and the vow line reweight prior material without sermonizing. The “we will not fear the dark we carry” edges toward thesis, but remains character‑grounded as a written ritual. Resonance lingers via the layered‑sky field.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of restitution, ethical stewardship of weather, and wonder as method emerge from particulars (feast-week rain denial; trading secrets for mercy). “Fear teaches but wonder persuades” is dramatized through choices rather than asserted. The final acceptance of silence as payment and “carrying play like prayer” reframes value and labor without moralizing. Resonance lingers with a conceptual cost (a vow of unremunerated mending and travel).

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of witness, solidarity, and decolonizing spectacle emerge from particulars (pawns vanishing, button as comet, hear/here split) rather than moralizing. The final choice reweights the premise: history as footfall and echo rather than recorders and rulers. A few declarative lines (“I unbind the record from spectacle…”) tread close to thesis, but they are earned by scene pressure and images. Resonance lingers without neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres through particulars: language as home, the ethics of self‑erasure, and forgiveness. Recurring images (feather, stone, jars, hidden thunder) shift meaning at the end; “Your home has the shape of your mouth” risks on‑the‑nose but is earned by the world’s logic and dramatized acts. The final hello offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful (practice vs. place) and invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme (responsibility for taught harm; redemption as process) arises organically from tactics and images—no sermonizing. The “winnowing” and “labyrinth” recur as ethics, not ornaments, and are reweighted at the end. The quiet refusal of absolution (pigeons left) resists tidy moral closure while offering resonant repricing. Chess pedagogy reframes power and pity without simplistic binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of communal atonement, refracted truth, and redistributed cost emerge from concrete actions and recurring images. The “forgiveness is not silence” line teeters on explicit moralizing but is cushioned by the image of a breeze that refuses echo. Subtext thrives in the child’s chant and the spire’s tonal “judgment.” Resonance lingers without closed‑form sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of grief, repair, and making absence legible emerge organically through kintsugi seams, the “map of absence,” and the charm as refused design. The ending offers a resonant answer: meaning is pattern and chosen tendency, not retrieval—“the nearest thing to truth I can breathe.” No moralizing; images carry the subtext. Recurring motifs reprice themselves at closure without neat comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of authenticity vs. replication and “temporary eternity” emerge organically via mirrors, breath, and the unsigning. The pool’s voice edges close to stating thesis (“keep yourself from vanishing into copies”) but is embedded in scene and earns its clarity. The final choice reweights prior images without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around tenderness as effective force, ritual as labor, and listening as ethics; it emerges through action (scent, hum) and the beekeeper parallel. The final cadence reweights prior images—the vial, prayer‑wheel light, wind seam—without moralizing, aside from one earned line (“the right kind of listening is work”). The “screaming tenderness” phrase recurs meaningfully and blooms at closure. Ambiguity lingers productively in the sea “hears nothing and everything.”

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars—tools, tides, voice—rather than sermonizing, culminating in the reframed “reverse migration.” The final image offers a resonant answer: route over recovery, companionship within absence. A single explanatory line risks on‑the‑nose (“not return but recognition”), but it’s earned by prior beats and deepens rather than flattens. Subtext operates in the censer/compass ritual and the counting/singing memory.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action and image: safety as promise, objects holding pain, rumor versus evidence, community learning to breathe with honesty. Subtext hums in “the laughter snagged” and “glass had no nervous system,” avoiding sermonizing even with one aphoristic line. The final image (“Fractured grace…until the eye grows warm”) reweights prior motifs into a durable ethic with cost. Resonance lingers without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme (“witnessed isolation,” signals across absence, the ethics of keeping names) emerges organically through image and method, not thesis. The “gaps” motif transforms from technique to moral stance at the end. The final act (hiding the notch, holding light/flower “like a promise borrowed”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. No sentimentality; ambiguity is purposeful and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of choice, attention, and the ethics of empiricism emerge through tactile particulars (ants’ tracks as promises; the door that “stops time long enough to notice”). The ending reweights the premise into daily practice without moralizing; “usability I could trust” is a fresh, pragmatic answer. One on‑the‑nose articulation (“the door did not choose for you”) slightly reduces the subtext’s quiet power. Overall, resonance is earned through image rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: power vs. self, flame vs. moth, omen vs. road, names and silences as thresholds. The moth/flame confession reframes her dreams and the sovereign’s gaze in a way that deepens the final choice without moralizing. The ending’s repricing (wearing dreams “like a ring”) answers the initial hunger with complexity, not closure-by-slogan. Subtext breathes through images and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action: observation as devotion, presence as a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry, love framed as “repeatable wonder.” Recurring images (curl, pocket sun, thresholds) shift meaning at the end to reweight time and relation. The final cadence offers a resonant answer without moralizing: keep the chamber open by returning differently. Purposeful ambiguity lingers while remaining coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: continuity versus chaos, narrative as heat, and the trickster nature of memory/time. Motifs (grave, scroll, kettle, ravens) return reweighted, with the final stance offering a resonant, non‑literal answer—keep walking while narrative “soars just ahead.” The conceptual repricing of continuity (“trick river plays on stones”) is earned by on‑page struggle and bargain. No sermonizing; ambiguity is purposeful and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ordinary miracles, humanizing time, and the ethics of holding are earned through concrete acts (the shared repair, the taught rhythm). Thematic images shift meaning: drops as “vowels,” the screw “remembers birth,” water as teacher of “holding.” No sermonizing; the final audio of water/laughter delivers a non‑literal answer that reweights all prior material. Ambiguities linger productively.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: transforming pain by revisiting superstition as a rigorous kindness; apology as weatherwork crystallizes the moral calculus without sermonizing. Recurring images (steam/page, crystals of fear, doors marked by childhood rules) reweight by the end as the tea is drunk and “letters settle in me as warmth.” The piece resists neat moralizing—fear’s doorways become passages without erasing their cost. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of imperfect miracles, rumor vs. truth, and forgiveness deepen through particulars (perfume as door; music as rumor that survives). Subtext operates via images (peach beside treble clef) that recast debt and push action. One explicit theme line (“Imperfect miracles are all we get”) tips the hand slightly but the ending reweights without moralizing. The clumsy nocturne as “ours” delivers resonant, earned acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around listening as making room and the redefinition of agency from verdict to hinge; recurring images (breath, spiral, dictionary) accrue meaning and reweight at the end. The “Listen” entry grounds the abstraction in a concrete pivot. Slight explicitness (“My task was not to end or to judge, but to be a hinge”) edges toward telling, but it is earned by the ritual’s experience. The final invitation (“Be listening...”) resonates without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically: time as edge, devices as tracers of severance, and labor as threshold-keeping. The wound, the drip, and the beacon blink concretize the insight; the grandmother’s key reframes duty as heart-work without sermonizing. The final charged poise (“exactly placed at the edge of what came next”) offers a resonant non-literal answer. A single declarative line (“what the clocks measured…razor edges”) risks on-the-nose but is earned by the scene’s particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—vigilance as hospitality, walls vs. membranes, familiar strangers—emerges through specific events and images rather than lecture. Recurring motifs (mesh gaps, polite alarms, breath/lungs) reweight the ending without a tidy moral. One aphoristic line (“What begins as vigilance can become hospitality”) risks overt statement but is earned by scene work. The Kian thread infuses subtext without commandeering the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from image and action—the lantern, martingale, priors, and “stewardship not theater”—without sermonizing. “Lucid contradictions” is embodied in the final bridge to the father (“Only if you do not either”), a resonant, non‑literal answer that reweights the premise. The city’s “public secrets” offers a humane, layered counterpoint to private ledger and risk. The last lines re‑cast the world as a patient teacher, avoiding tidy moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: doors, latches, keys, and the “necessary instrument for listening without wanting” braid into a meditation on mediated care and beginnings within endings. The elevator rescue reweights “cultivated estrangement” from abstraction to ethic, paid in silence when she chooses not to speak to the child. The pressed flower and ledger title crystalize conceptual repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: context as timekeeper, memory as proximate causality, covenant as a living system. Recurring images (tide, ink, locket) reprice meaning at the end without moralizing; “entries belong to the hour when context changes” crystallizes the conceptual answer. The piece resists tidy absolutes by ending in charged poise (no touching yet). A couple of explicit statements flirt with telling but are earned by the concrete scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (reciprocity as a logistics of kindness) is embedded in objects, rules, and actions rather than asserted, and the final handoff of the moon rock reweights responsibility across time. Subtext hums in lines like “It already has,” which reframes the miracle as a communal act. The postcards’ “cost a memory” binds tenderness to price without sermonizing. A hairline of explicitness (“cure for loneliness”) appears but is earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme arises organically: cartography of feeling, acceptance as navigation, axis vs. escape. Recurring images (ring, notes, constellations, hearth) shift meaning at the end without moralizing; the line “not to guide them away from sorrow” edges toward statement yet remains grounded in action. The stillpoint reframes mapping as marrow, not ink—a conceptual repricing with emotional aftertaste. Ambiguity persists productively (cost endures) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—language as lever, responsibility as neighborliness, editing over fate—emerges from concrete acts, not lecture. Recurring images (furrows/terraces, bowls of water, treaties) shift meaning at the end, recoding prayer as praxis. The final lines reprice the premise without moralizing, landing an earned, complex “manual for ladders” that invites reflection. Ambiguity is purposeful: who edited history remains open but ethically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (map/tide/camera/bell) deepen into a statement about memory, art, and vanishing; subtext flows through permission, erasure, and vow. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis (“the aim was always the same... by mapping silence”), softening the otherwise earned resonance. The piece still leaves a charged, lingering afterimage (song as remembrance), but trims of on‑the‑nose lines would strengthen the thematic finish. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality until that slight over‑articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation through transformative heat, obligation as a ledger of gratitude, and secrecy as ethical stance. Recurring images (fire as kiln/primer, seeds as punctuation) reweight themselves at the end without moralizing. The final vow (“lending of breath, not pages”) is resonant and earned. Complexity persists: love and violence, protection and erasure entwine without tidy absolutes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of grief’s entanglement versus institutional untangling emerges through action, not thesis. The “recovery vs agreed awakening” line reframes the narrative without sermonizing, and donors’ incorporation complicates identity with grace. Recurring images (drumming, bridges, breath) re-signify by the end. The final exhale offers a resonant, non-literal answer about communal identity and chosen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of humility, listening, and worker knowledge versus bluster emerge organically through image and tactic (whispered brass, folded maps, zodiac pause). Subtext in status play (Ivo’s soft authority schooling Rade) reads without sermonizing. The final line edges toward thesis-stating, but it stays imagistic enough to avoid a hard penalty. The coin’s cyclical motif quietly widens the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of grief, witness, and the ethics of holding light emerge through concrete action and motif rather than sermon. “Teach darkness the value of stars” risks explicitness but is earned by the mirror/shutter praxis and the brother’s on‑page cost. Subtext hums in nonverbal exchange and material gestures; the final charged poise reweights everything without moralizing. The piece invites reflection without blurring into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of hesitation, listening, and communal pacing emerge organically from particulars (metronomes stopped, uncut cloth, stalemate). A few lines edge into thesis (“decisions need a longer cradle than a clock”), trimming some subtextual charge. Still, the ending reweights prior images with resonance rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of nonviolent struggle, consent, and self‑naming are dramatized through concrete acts (detaching lines, laying the scrimshaw, ferrying others). Recurring images (island holding, ropes untying, whale song) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The pirate’s redirected violence and the protagonist’s public tenderness offer layered counter‑readings. The final stance (“detach without abandoning”) resonates as earned wisdom rather than a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece enacts, rather than states, its thematic argument: grief’s “lightness” versus coercive happiness, surveillance versus unmeasurable hush. Recurring images (bouquet, sink theatrics, turbines, flute) reweight by the end so that “Behold…lightness” resonates as a non‑literal answer. Subtext thrives in gesture—the off‑mic choreography, teaching “unflaggable” pause—without sermonizing. Ambiguity has teeth, not fuzziness; counter‑currents (paid compliance vs. quiet resistance) remain charged.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of ethical presence and porous boundaries arise from concrete acts (translated decree, touch that “walks boundaries awake”). Subtext works through hush, harmonics, and glass-as-diaphragm rather than moralizing, though a few lines verge on thesis (“turn it toward an ethics of presence”). The ending reweights the charter and fear with a fertile certainty, inviting reflection without flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: imperfection as rhythm and truth tuned by breath, not asserted. The reed’s “tune wind to truth” and the plant lexicon let subtext operate in image and gesture rather than moralizing. The final cadence (“laugh without proof”) offers a resonant answer: awakenings come through bartered vulnerability, not perfect clarity. Ambiguity lingers productively around color as “one oath among many.”

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through action and image—the braid of listening, grief, and repair—rather than lecture. The recurring objects (lens, bells) evolve in meaning, culminating in the braid assertion that reweights prior material and commits to practice over conclusion. A touch of explicit statement (“connection is not a bridge but a braid”) slightly reduces the ineffability, but it’s earned and concretized by prior textures. The final outward trajectory (school, hospice, square) extends resonance without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically via objects and actions (hinges, wire, lily/Lyra, intention vs action), not just assertion. Moments like “Good grief is a hinge” risk aphorism but are grounded by concrete ritual and the mother’s scene, avoiding sermon. The ending reweights prior images—curtains, lily, mechanism—into a resonant answer about endurance over cure. Subtext of craft as anatomy of mourning hums beneath every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres through particulars—value, mapping, inheritance, and community as crossing‑maps rather than prophecy. Recurring objects (tape, cards, butcher paper) embody a humane ethics: measure, don’t mystify; accept payment to reject false scarcity. The last line reweights the whole with a charged, non‑literal answer. No sermonizing; resonance comes via image and method.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme is robust: knowledge vs. purity, responsibility vs. conquest, permission vs. possession; it emerges through patterned actions (refusals, non-cadence litany) and charged images. The conceptual flip—archives as permissions—reframes everything with cost. Slight over-articulation in the final paragraphs edges toward moralizing (“the reward is not citation… to love responsibly”), softening the otherwise implicit power. Subtext still hums in the “anguished joy” thread and the charged mirrors/compass.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: hope as an archival act with cost, belonging reclaimed through traded regret. The river stone and vines evolve from image to ethic, avoiding moralizing while delivering an answer in action. “Joy arrive carrying luminous regret” reframes victory with consequence. Ambiguity remains thoughtful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: certainty versus doubt, ornament versus honesty, hope’s hunger versus accountability. The returning objects (tail tip and brochure) reweight belief with a conceptual price; “certainty is a predator, and doubt a steward” risks aphorism but is earned by prior concrete acts. The final stillness answers the central question with a charged poise rather than a moral. Subtext travels through tools, mist, and removal, not thesis‑telling.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: closure as cultivation, not a gate; misallocated grace and the ethics of carrying it. The final image (“not a gate but a garden”) reweights prior motifs (rings, roots, hush) without sermonizing. Subtext lives in the trade—the hourglass’s time repurposed into growth—answering the central question with resonance. No platitude; complexity persists alongside acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: unused love as “overqualified,” letters as scripts, thresholds replacing departures. The concluding “goodbye that said, stay” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that reweights the whole. Recurring images (reels, doors, thunder/breath) shift meaning at the end without sermonizing. Any explicit aphorisms are earned by precedent and folded into scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of vocation-as-burden, liberation through listening, and communal creativity emerge organically from concrete acts (tracing meteors, etched light sentences, windows opening). The final reweighting—building a bridge with others and the night learning to speak—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One declarative line (“Creativity is not a single prisoner”) edges toward statement but is earned by scene. The ambiguity feels purposeful, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of guardianship, memory vs. erasure, and time’s custody emerge organically via the clock, the archive, and spores. The ending’s reweighting—train as greenhouse, clock self‑breathing—answers the central question with action, not moralizing. Recurring images (midnight, dunes’ song, wave functions) accrue meaning and shift at the close. The complexity lingers: survival is maintenance, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: practice as prayer, repair vs. ruin, and learning one’s mind through the wind’s grammar. The final repricing (“frontier” as interior distance; miracles ticking true) reweights every prior image without sermonizing. Recurring motifs (gear, wind‑method, hum) shift meaning credibly. No moralizing intrudes, and resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: courage as a companion that “keeps pace” and must be claimed, not bestowed. Recurring motifs (lullaby, star click, skiff) shift meaning at the end without moralizing, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. The line “There is no wrong, only unfinished” reweights the fear, and the final acceptance reframes the journey as self‑carrying. Subtext in the guides’ patience deepens the idea of earned readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars (confiscated music, taxed silence, guiding warmth) rather than sermon, culminating in a reweighted ethic: safety can remain but at a new price. The “unpardonable silence” line edges close to telling, yet is earned by prior scene work and underwrites the final permission touch. Recurring images (teeth, cobalt, breath/fog) gain new valence at the end. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of truth as context (“the rune... moves context until truth fits its costume”) is realized through concrete particulars: comma, ink, drift, names. The ending’s “not all truths require trumpets” reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext in deference and ritual—Lyr’s patience and the library’s courtesy—makes the collapse humane. Resonance lingers beyond the scene with the curriculum nod.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of adaptation, memory, and “assembly” as temporal rather than spatial solidity emerge from actions, not moralizing. The final repricing—“nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move”—reweights every prior image (ribbon, vertebrae, lanterns) with cost and grace. Subtext (reef’s dying breath guiding a living corridor) operates through images and community ritual. Complexity is embraced without tidy comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (margin of daylight, echoes, map vs bearings) organically point to meaning as navigation rather than fury. However, the last line states the thesis explicitly (“Meaning…is simply the courage to ask…”) which blunts subtext and earns a penalty for thematic echo. Prior images already carried the insight through action (projected coordinates as communal compass). Resonance is strong but slightly over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (“intent vs implanted destiny”) emerges through concrete images—nails in seed, trellis, reeds as chorus—and culminates in a non‑literal answer: a listening seedling rather than a nailed fate. The kite’s clandestine rhymes and the final communal scaffold reweight tradition without sermonizing. One line nears thesis‑statement territory, but the imagery carries the resonance. The ending lingers as a conceptual repricing with communal cost/benefit.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of human care versus automation, optimism grounded in maintenance, and making rooms storms can enter emerge through particulars (grafts as stitches, logbooks paired with plants). Subtext carries via images and action; the gull rescue recalibrates “stillness” into a working compass. One explicit line (“optimism meant doors, not denial”) flirts with thesis-stating but is supported by scene work. The final image resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Threads, faces, and lenses braid into a theme of guidance reconfigured from fragments; the “fragmented reality” is repurposed into a working beam. The keeper’s line about untangling threads is reweighted at the end by action, not proclamation. The closing vow reframes fate from tarot to stewardship, a resonant answer to “Who answers the Keeper’s log when the Keeper is gone?” Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of commodified panic, agency vs. control, and ethical craft are embodied in objects (ink, metronome) and actions (refusal). The final image reweights the premise: choosing not to trade crisis unhooks the clock. One explicit line (“crisis should be no one’s currency”) edges toward moralizing, but the scene work mostly carries meaning. The hummingbird’s brief loss/finding creates resonant subtext about presence and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars—maintenance as love, archives as discourse, silence as complicity—without sermonizing, save one apt line. The ending reweights earlier motifs, offering a non‑literal answer: to keep the world discussable, one must risk. Subtext runs through infrastructure-as-desire, with the city’s “unspoken conversation” embodied in altered behaviors. Resonance lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of mercy versus debt, stewardship, and communal reorientation emerge through action (naming, sheathing, teaching roses) rather than thesis. The final pairing of letter and ballast scrap reframes cost and continuity with a resonant, non‑literal answer. Recurrent images (“engraved quiet,” “tranquil blaze,” shade over fire) shift meaning at closure. No moralizing; ambiguity around the father remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Listening versus owning, stewardship versus extraction, and the ethics of translation cohere through recurring images (silence as cast; tracks as music that “carry weight”). The ending’s “Give it back” reframes the quest as custodial—an earned, non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext hums in the rail spike’s history and the goddess as “promise before thunder,” avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of control vs. transparency, gravity vs. agency, inheritance vs. accountability emerge through images and choices, not sermonizing. Recurrent motifs (orbits, tides, ink, lens) shift meaning at the end. One line edges thesis (“gravity is a fine servant and a poor god”) but it feels earned by the proved consequence. Subtext in the caretaker’s regret and the nib’s reprise deepens the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of staying versus fleeing, and how we translate harm into repair, accrues through images (tether, amber, firmware, hush). The ending reweights everything: the map points inward; forgiveness is deferred, not declared. Subtext works via object choices and translations without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around miracle versus craft.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres through particulars: attention as distributive magic, mess over certainty, teeth that “know when to bite and when to chew.” The final image reprices prior material—the hush becomes a portable ethic—not a stated moral. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“ordinary magic of attention distributing possibility fairly”), but it’s earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of naming as reparative labor and mercy that resists erasure emerge organically from ritual acts and charged objects. Recurring images (tessera, steel arms, warm coldness) accrue meaning and reweight the ending. A few lines articulate thesis overtly (“We rename not to erase...”), flirting with didacticism, but the scene work mostly carries the weight. The final “warm coat of frost” breath sharpens the paradox without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Memory versus release accrues through concrete acts (echoes, marquee names, sweeping seats) rather than thesis. The final house‑light image reweights nostalgia as kind guidance, not indulgence, answering the piece’s question about what to keep and how to let go. Subtext in “cashier and conductor” and the ghost’s jealous gratitude adds complexity without moralizing. Resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kindness as method, art as conduit, and grief’s navigation emerge from action and image. The line “the trick is kindness...” risks stating theme, but it’s dramatized by the subsequent, quiet cure. Recurring images (lantern near stairs, river forgiving a field) reweight the premise at the end. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through action: consent, translation, and non‑ownership are embodied in negotiation, pattern‑listening, and the contractual leaf. The “factually mystical” premise integrates with ethical stakes; “promises are materials here” refigures responsibility without sermonizing. A few declaratives (“The unknown wants a breathable story”) risk stating the thesis, but they’re earned by scene pressure. The ending reweights voice as restraint rather than appropriation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres through particulars: buttons as failed closures becoming bridges; prophecy as loom versus line; silence as road, not room. The ending offers a resonant answer—collective, living wisdom replaces fixed fate—without moralizing. Occasional aphoristic lines flirt with statement, but they’re earned by concrete labor on the page. Recurrences meaningfully shift meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of courage as practice and trust as the locus where “unused courage waits” emerges through action (codes, renunciation, ring). Subtext resides in pressure, gesture, and object choice rather than sermonizing, though Len’s line edges close to voiced thesis. The final image of ring over scars and walking home renewed offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity persists without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of rewriting fear without erasing it is embodied in the palimpsest stitching and the river crossing. Subtext runs through the needle, letters, and map—memory acknowledged, not obliterated. The final reweighting (“hills…more like breathing”) offers an earned, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Occasional declaratives (“This map shows everything…”) flirt with on‑the‑nose but are counterbalanced by image‑driven work.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through enacted kindness and craft ethos rather than lecture; key line “Because the same kindness keeps happening here” is embedded as image‑answer from the glass, not authorial summary. Recurring images (glass, threads, thrum, smoke, cups) reweight at closure. The final intention reframes “resistance to change” as practice, not stasis, without tidy moralizing. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of repair, caretaking, and “protected vulnerability” emerges organically from concrete acts (patching skiff, nursing wick, housing flame). The final image reweights earlier material (rooting slips of light at home), offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The locksmith/gardener braid grounds the insight; no sermonizing undercuts the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of solitude vs. independence, translation, and coexistence accrue through recurrent images (blade of light, baskets, hum) and reweight at the end (“weather into shelter”). Subtext works through listening as labor and mutual patronage with the extinct; no sermonizing. The final shelter-word and prepared empty chairs offer a resonant, non‑literal answer. Minor ding for the relative neatness of the calm return.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of connection, secrecy, and communal voice emerge through concrete ritual and objects; the “thread” literalizes into paths and sentences. The final chorus reprices privacy, arguing for belonging through shared language without moralizing. Recurring images (spiral, droplets, bowl) shift meaning at the end. A few explicit restatements of method/aim verge on telling but do not undercut resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through action: neutrality redefined as a landing pattern for meaning; breath and cadence as civic autonomy. Subtext hums in the wave’s “ear that loved us as noise” and the countersigns that salt pauses into rallies. The final pencil note edges toward a stated moral, though it’s earned via lived tactic and paid cost. The piece leaves resonant ambiguity about vigilance without flattening into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of treaty vs conquest and listening as governance arise organically through tools, music, and geometry; the last line reweights the premise without moralizing. The “maps as promises” belief pays off in a gentle anti‑colonial ethic—cooperation with space. Resonance is strong and lingers; the lack of a sharper on‑page cost at the end holds this short of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (mask, ribbon, knots, lancing) braid into a coherent meditation on empathy as “unifying opposites” and the ethics of attention. The painting as act of care, and the letter’s ambiguous confession, generate subtext without neat absolution. The final standalone line “To awaken dormant empathy” leans toward overt thesis, slightly blunting the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around stewardship vs control, the ethical duty to the dead, and maps as inquiry. Subtext blooms in the reframing of “exile” as “refuge,” culminating in the braid that now runs both ways. The witty “librarianship… stewardship with better indexes” toes the line of thesis but remains character‑true. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of debt, forgiveness, and art as policy emerge organically through action and motif (“the system reads music as policy,” “pixelated amnesty”). The final reconfiguration—ledger “signs a receipt,” future‑leaning counting—reweights the earlier disbelief without moralizing. Bridges/music/image currency triangulate into a coherent thesis about crossings and memory. Ambiguity is purposeful yet not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: routes, ownership, and belonging reframed by the final circle where hunter and hunted trade names. Recurring images (ribbons, bills, lions, dusk) gather new weight at the end without moralizing. The insight that “to live is to leave signs” lands as earned wisdom rooted in particulars, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers productively (inheritance vs. innovation; stewardship vs. commerce).

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of shared burdens and healing through ordinary words emerges from concrete acts (mirror-pilgrimage parable enacted by their call-and-response). Subtext operates in images (silence as basin, sorrow washing) and the charged reprise of the daylily. A few explicit lines verge on telling (“I heal with words,” “Through variable stars…we learned meaning”), but they are earned by scene pressure. The ending reweights prior particulars without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically: spectacle vs. truth, what mirrors hide, the ethics of retrieval. The lake’s refusal functions as moral counterforce without sermonizing, and the seed literalizes the idea that truths bite back. The final “warlike serenity” image conceptually reprices the opening: the performer’s mirrors cede to earned stillness and communal listening. No moral is stated; resonance comes through images and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of consent, time’s authority, and co‑agency with a sentient environment emerge through concrete images (hedges as doors, sundial that “told only tides,” braided vow). The final reconfiguration (“maze… a grammar”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to oath‑making: yes without erasing no. No sermonizing; meaning accrues via pattern and object reprise. Slight limit: opposition’s quick acquiescence mutes the ethical pressure in the final pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of repair vs. erasure, kindness as blade, and “listening” accrue through images and choices rather than thesis. The final act reframes growth as borrowed, not owned, offering a resonant answer to the initial desire to patch holes. The hush‑of‑a‑scholar turn complicates heroism without sermonizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of how we value memory vs. market, and what remains “after the applause,” emerges through action and image, not thesis. The scrap’s repricing reframes worth and grief without sentimentality. The echo motif accrues meaning and culminates in a resonant final image. Insights feel earned through concrete particulars (burned corner, cigarette, sirens).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: translation as physics, resonance as knowledge, breath as bridge. The closing reprices the premise—companionship with transition rather than mastery—without moralizing, reframing the seed’s function and the spirit’s absence. Recurring images (touching distance, rails’ hum, double inscriptions) accrue meaning and modulate at the end. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of identity’s fluidity, wonder within routine, and contradiction as method surface organically through image and action. “Remembering is just wonder doing chores” risks aphorism but is earned by on‑page labor. The ending reweights the premise: keep, accept flux, preserve without pinning. Complexity lingers without neat moral; resonance is strong rather than shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of connection vs survivalist isolation arises organically through actions and images (shell confessions, radiance threading). The final cadence reframes survival as communal permeability without stating a moral. The “door made of faces” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. No sermonizing despite abstractable material.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: responsibility vs. hubris, listening vs. imposing models on nature. The graffiti line “River does what it was asked to do” reappears reweighted, avoiding didacticism. Final actions (marking the bank, writing a new rule) provide a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity persists—solace without absolution—inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of patience, unsaid truth, and ethical timekeeping emerges organically from particulars (propagation delays, reversed cycles, ash map, breath‑writing), not sermon. The final image reweights the premise: to “speak by learning when to wait” reframes communication as earned restraint with cost. Recurring objects accrue meaning without overt allegory, and the promise to burn the first letter admits moral price. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: living memory versus archiving control, promise versus institutional capture, propagation as communal antidote. Recurring particulars (coffee‑stain astronomy, perforations, plants listening) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image—last drop tasted, officers too late—offers a resonant non‑literal answer. Ambiguity lingers around consequences while the stance is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of grief as care, consent after breath, and kindness as the residue of a life arise from particulars (chip’s ethics, balm receiving words). Subtext carries in images (threshold of stillness, seed for archive) without sermonizing. The mentor’s line risks a thesis echo but functions as earned craft-transmission that charges the ending’s acceptance. The final cadence reweights the premise—keeping shimmer, not revival—with clean resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as transformation, contentment as caretaking flow, rebirth via vines and seeds. The final realization reweights the premise without sermonizing; the one explicit sentence about contentment is earned by the prior scene work. Motifs (hairpin/comb, river, vineyard hush) shift meaning at the end. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the charged image of belonging without ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: doubt as instrument, truth as negotiated weather, and integrity as practice rather than pose. The hollow mirror shard and cloak of doubt reweight the final stance without sermonizing. The choice honors complexity while refusing false equivalence. The last lines (“wind over thunder”) provide a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (“absence as gift/space”) emerges through image and action rather than sermonizing, with strong subtext in withholding and silence. A few explicit lines flirt with statement (“not as a trick, but a gift of space”) but the resonance is earned by the river vision and the closing application. Recurring motifs (rings, knots, hum) reweight meaning by the end. The final composure reads as wisdom paid for, not bestowed.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises organically—reverence, listening as locomotion, communion with ancestors—through concrete acts rather than commentary. The final reweighting (travel by agreement) is earned and lingers. The line “Hold still, the canyon says, and the world will carry you” edges toward thematic articulation, modestly flattening the implicitness. Even so, the last images (empty cord, birds settling, pulse less alone) deliver honest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme (“attention over optimization; failure as nourishment”) arises from concrete acts and images—the patient light, the notch “refusal,” the blank‑paper table—rather than sermonizing. The final renunciation reweights the premise without moralizing: a charged poise around custodianship and non‑possession. Lines like “what could you build if failure…started nourishing attention” risk directness but are earned by prior particulars. The aftereffect is reflective and specific, not platitudinous.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: patience, attention as devotion, and the ethics of listening rather than luck. The luminous vows reweight the premise, turning magic into discipline; the last image reconceives the goal (sound seen) without didacticism. Subtext (“hides behind truth,” “practice of tending brightness others see first”) complicates the narrator’s stance. Resonance lingers through a concrete vow with a non‑tidy cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme coheres around randomness-as-devotion and causality running “uphill,” with an earned, non-didactic final reweighting. Recurrences (coins, static, amber) shift meaning at the end, transforming divination into ethical attention. The piece resists moralizing and sustains ambiguity while offering a felt answer through image: the corridor of usable silence. Insight arises from the work done on the page, not from declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of sacrifice, naming as bridge, and harbors versus shorelessness emerge through concrete actions and objects. The ending reweights prior material (a harbor sketched where “Shoreless” was) without moralizing. One declarative line—“Names are not cages…”—risks didacticism, but it’s embedded and earned by scene work. Ambiguity remains purposeful, resisting tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: humility over grandiosity, listening as power, and mercy within limits. The bell/prayer motif shifts meaning at the end, with the fisherman’s question reframing survival as learning hunger differently. Insight is earned by the concrete ritual and modest payoff; no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise with quiet, durable resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of custodial memory—stories as levees—emerges through action and image, not just assertion, with the mentor’s lesson grounded in scene particulars (condensation letters, smashed blue bottle). The final communal braid of voices functions as an answer to the bureau’s erasure. A couple direct formulations risk slight overstatement but feel earned. The last hush reweights earlier images without a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of harmonizing logic and intuition is woven through recurring objects (flame, crystal, ribbon, birds) and reprised with new weight at the end. The grandmother’s counsel arrives as image‑language within the world’s logic, not as moralizing. The final “home” tone reweights prior material without stating a thesis. Ambiguity is purposeful, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme coheres around vigilance, ritual, and trust’s tensile strength; “remembering through muscle memory” deepens into ethos rather than slogan. The ending reweights the premise: burden becomes a “harness adjusted,” not removed, offering a resonant answer to duty under pressure. Recurring images (stitching, rope, seam) accrue meaning without sermonizing. The past failure and present restraint complicate any tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Complementary opposites evolve from lesson to ethic, reframing guardianship as circuit rather than possession. The river image reweights the theme of entering/leaving at once, echoed in joint custody. No moralizing; resonance arrives through image and action (taste of river stones, static). Complexity remains: blessing unity without tidying identity or lineage ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of caretaking over spectacle and the ethics of attention accrues organically through plant-care as praxis, not just symbol. Final images reprice the premise: a room that “solved the solver” and a note promising “quiet rigor.” A few lines tilt toward thesis (“We hold space for people to practice choices”), slightly on-the-nose. Overall resonance lingers without false tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through action: ritual labor translating grief into communal cadence without sermonizing. Recurring images (pull cord, mulch of silence, echo as judge) shift meaning at the end, offering a non-literal answer: repaired silence as foundational. Ambiguity is purposeful—grief is welcomed as listener, not defeated—avoiding moral neatness. The emotional aftereffect lingers in the city’s unwitting rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres through recurring particulars: boundaries of light, carrying thresholds, and the ethics of respect. Subtext operates in object action (pendant’s radius; sundial’s “confession”) rather than sermon. The final image rephrases home as portable thresholds, a resonant answer without moralizing. One direct thematic line appears early, but it’s earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of creative destruction emerges through particulars, not lecture: dismantling as “room-making” is embodied by the crozier’s sacrifice and the gate’s opening. Recurring images (penny drop, frost-bloom, hinge) reweight meaning in the final cadence. The line addressed to the “empty future” veers toward aphorism but remains dramatized. Resonance lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as tuning, beginnings inside endings, keeping time with what’s released. Recurring images (hush, star fragment, lightning scar, moon‑needle) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final stance honors loss without repair, avoiding sentimentality. The single line “Begin last, end first” echoes as praxis, not slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: permanence vs. transience, labor’s ritual meeting time’s indifference. Recurring images (wake lattice, hourglass, fog‑rumor schedules) reprice themselves at the end where farewells become arrivals that “move through” the narrator. No moralizing; the final acceptance of tide offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that enriches prior beats. Ambiguity is meaningful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme integrates ethics, trust, and architecture: “rational enchantment” reframes proof as communal steadiness, not spectacle. Recurring images (thread, doors, bridges) reweight at the end—habits as internal artifacts. No sermonizing; the curator’s doubt (“Why trust a bridge that appears only when crossed”) earns the repricing. Resonance lingers as a lived practice rather than a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres through concrete images: light’s comfort vs. the subtlety of distant pull; stars as pressure; edges as memory. The final line offers a non‑literal answer—listening until the horizon “tells you where to fall”—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Recurring objects and pressures accrue meaning rather than being explained. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of listening as labor and love accrues through particulars (right ear as tenderness, not impairment; grief “redialed his sleep”). The “incidental heroism” final turn reweights the whole—quiet service over grand gesture—without moralizing. Subtext works in image and silence; the hearing aid’s pulses recode what “finding” means. Resonance lingers in the charged stillness of the last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Memory, attention, and moral return emerge through particulars: phase transitions, “Return” key as ritual, and reading names aloud. The piece resists moralizing, letting the renunciation and the machine’s comment field do the thematic lifting. The ending reweights the premise: being “noticed back” becomes standing witness and surrendering a charm. Subtext is consistent and earned, with no exposition of thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme (“fetch wisdom from failure,” hubris vs humility, which ghost to feed) emerges organically from spilled‑ink method, shard/lens, and the mentor’s voice. The final act reweights prior images without moralizing; “a lens cut small for carrying” reframes pain into tool. Purposeful ambiguity lingers around identity and the ghost’s ontology while answering the central question via stance. No sermonizing despite aphoristic lines.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of extraction ethics, stewardship, and language as embodied texture develop through concrete images (curse as a “contract without punctuation,” vowels traded for grain). Subtext operates in refusals (canyon resisting law/war) and in the choice to feed the curse only dead names. The ending reweights the premise: a mobile, communal recording replaces print, with ethical protocols (“ask permission of the echoes”) embedded. No didactic moralizing; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme coheres around hospitality versus naming, bitterness reworked into a cosmic joke, and consent to be remade. Recurring motifs (“frostbitten hope,” the tooth/seed, bulbs’ play) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final stance answers the piece’s question by choosing stewardship with cost. Occasional explicit lines (“I spoke aloud the mission…”) flirt with telling but are earned by action and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (locust husk, heart rhythms, copper halos) articulate a theme of attention as liberation; subtext moves through image rather than explanation. The orchard’s shift from courtroom to listening animal embodies the thematic turn. A single explicit thesis line (“Beauty does not beg…”) edges into moralizing, slightly dulling the afterglow. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of promises/absence emerges from action and motif rather than sermonizing; Mina’s line risks thesis‑statement but is grounded in the on‑page storm‑catalog of absences. The “linking absences” method reweights into ethos, not just navigation. Final images (forgiven cobalt arcade, boy’s posture changing) deliver resonance without tidy moral. Complexity lingers around complicity (drones, silence) without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme crystallizes through action: consent over coercion, listening as agency, community drawn by “wrong turns.” The final cadence reweights prior images (bells, hush, halo) without moralizing, delivering conceptual repricing with emotional afterglow. Subtext moves in objects and intervals; no thesis is stated. The closing vow and shared breath resonate beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    The motif net (curvature, coastlines, memory as weather) coheres into an earned realization: “Every ending is a coastline” reframes the quest without sermonizing. Final cadence—“not found… seen its weather”—reprices meaning and value of partial knowledge. The scarf and snow reprise charge the ethic of care over conquest. No platitudes; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres around longing, custody versus passage, and naming without chains, emerging through actions and images rather than moralizing. The final answer—“escaping is a kind of address”—reweights prior motifs (maps, coordinates, plates) without asserting a thesis. Subtext hums in refusals (not turning to look) and the library’s charged “listening.” The piece invites reflection on how we vitalize absence without collapsing it into lack.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—freeing truth from the wrappings of fear—emerges via objects and action (ribbon loosening, silence as gauze, cathedral of swallowed whispers). Subtext breathes in gesture and image (speaking a promise “without her words,” mirrors reconfiguring). Slight on‑the‑nose articulation (“a lock is made of belief,” “the work was not to make truth appear…”) trims the mystique without collapsing it. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around memory as tithe/ledger and truth as currency; it emerges through objects and acts, not sermonizing. Recurring images (constellations, ring, ledger, apples) reweight at the end, especially the triple inscription as stubborn correction across generations. The piece resists pat moralizing by embracing partial repair and “late fees.” Emotional aftereffect lingers as crisp, unsentimental reclamation with acknowledged cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of reversible exile, holding/keeping versus hoarding, and kindness as rigor emerge through image and action (leaves forming “unsolved triangles,” mirrors reconfiguring paths). The child’s line—“Your stubborn kindness that argues without punching”—delivers subtext without flattening ambiguity. A few thematic labels (“combative tenderness,” “keeping is not hoarding”) skirt direct statement but are earned by prior scene work. The ending reweights the premise via the hinge image (stay + corked dusk) rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—careful labor as a conduit for wonder and communal remembrance—emerges through concrete acts (pruning scars, harvesting scents, teaching breath) rather than thesis. The final image (“keeping a path swept where wonder prefers to walk”) reinterprets all prior moves without moralizing. Subtext in the child’s cracked sugar jar and gray‑facing chair elegantly ties domestic erosion to orchard fatigue. The conceptual repricing of “seed” as testimony-holder is resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of keeping versus taking, grief’s braiding with joy, and the ethics of grounding rather than banishing arise from particulars (stones, locket, net, “but not forever”). Subtext is carried by image and act, not statement, and the ending offers a resonant answer: stability as a tended, temporary poise. The caretaker’s line about what the sea would take reframes the sanctuary’s purpose with conceptual cost. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingering without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: listening as craft, wounds as seams, physics over superstition, communal memory. The final choice (tear visible; hush preserved) offers a resonant non-literal answer about what we owe to the past’s quiet. Subtext hums in the architecture-as-whisper and the verger’s attempted refusal. No moralizing; insights are earned by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of transmission, memory, and relinquishment emerge through particulars: logbook prayers, flakes’ “minor weather,” vector without coordinates. The final cadence (“time for air and sorrow”) reweights the enterprise without moralizing. One overt thesis line (“The physics of letting go…”) skirts abstraction but is anchored by on‑page images. Resonance lingers as conceptual repricing rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Listening as care, translation as civic act, and technology as a tender ghost interweave through concrete acts; the final hinge (“less a singer than a hinge”) reweights the premise. Recurring objects (plate, chalk, valves) accrue meaning without moralizing. One declarative line (“open the vents, share the water, listen”) risks thesis‑speak, but it’s earned by prior images and action. The ending lingers as a charged poise with ethical clarity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme (joy smuggled beneath anguish; affection as decryption) emerges through image and act, not sermon. The diary’s line “Keep what breaks you…” reweights the entire ascent without reading as authorial moralizing because it’s diegetic and earned. Subtext—care as method, encryption against despair, non‑trespass curation—operates consistently and charges the last tableau. The ending invites reflection without closing ambiguity down.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory-in-absence, forgiveness, and alternative epistemologies emerge from action and motif, not lecture. Recurring images (line/veins, telescope, blank lines) reweight meaning at the end. “Those lines are the proof” flirts with explicitness but is warranted by the built pattern. The father thread subtly refracts every choice without tilting into sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: limits discovered through craft under time pressure; memory preserved when bodies and buildings fail; a face-blind artist reading weight/pressure rather than faces to paint character in sky. The guild’s letter risks thesis-stating, but it’s operationalized into tactics (“breath thin layers,” “meter of storms”). The final repricing—that a room can “remember dawn” and survive collapse through attention and limit—lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Language, motion, and light braid into a coherent theme: play and translation as methods of discovery. Recurring objects (dog‑ear, hopscotch, instruments) reweight meaning at the end. One line edges toward thesis declaration (“I will find it where language becomes motion...”), slightly reducing the necessity of inference. Still, the final charged watchfulness and “phrasebook corner pinned to the stars” resonate beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: repair as attention, time as tide, keys as questions, and the acceptance of stewardship over ownership. The final recognition (“borrow and never own”) reweights everything prior without moralizing. Motifs (cedar, driftwood, clocks, mirrors) shift meaning at the end and avoid tokenism. The piece invites reflection with quiet ambiguity yet lands emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: community as technology against fear, rituals as scaffolds for trust, grief metabolized into coordination. Recurring images (bell, chalk, arches) shift meaning from survival signals to communal oath, avoiding moralizing. The line “tired together rather than tired alone” reframes the premise without preaching. The final misted oath enacts the answer rather than stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of mercy, time, and flawed caretaking emerge from concrete acts (filing a tooth gentler; singing a lullaby that “named each storm and forgave it”). The puppet’s counsel reframes failure as a beginning, deepening the moral calculus without sermonizing. The final poise—salvation as time enough to choose; ruin accompanied by courtesy—reweights the premise with resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of duty, memory as architecture, and bargains with living systems emerge through particulars (roots teaching gait; seeds remembering doors). “Graceless beauty” reframes the prayer/drowning image and anchors the final cadence. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: endurance as grace under a binding covenant with cost. No moralizing; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of connection vs. harm, strength vs. flexibility, and listening as ethical stance emerge through particulars (braids, reversible rings, swallows’ seams). The chrysalis and river reweight meaning at the close; atonement becomes ongoing attention, not erasure. One explicit statement (“To atone is not to erase…”) edges toward moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the ending’s charged poise carries resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme integrates elegantly: forgiveness as blankness, parole for beginnings, attention as currency, absence as measurable. The final image reweights the whole—beginnings require costly listening and surrender—without moralizing. “Rain deciding to be snow” and the comma‑seed recast choice and patience as creative ethics. The resonance is strong and lingers; a touch more moral friction could push it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of transforming—not erasing—pain is fully integrated through cooking as praxis; “sandpaper” vs. “erase” recurs in action, not moralizing. The archive of remorse and porous coral/ice metaphor reframes memory as something to be borne communally. The ending’s quiet Earned Stasis—keeper steadier, residue of salt rings—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity remains: the chef keeps coral “not hoarding,” acknowledging ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of connection over siloing, repair without erasure, and language as architecture emerge through concrete acts and refrain. The multilingual canon and “bridges hold because songs repeat” crystallize meaning without heavy sermonizing, though that line edges toward statement. Symbolic objects (pendulum/bridge) reweight at the end. Resonance lingers with plausible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres through event and image: entanglement, industry’s collapse, and tending seams culminate in a non‑literal answer about memory stewardship. Recurring motifs (mirror, helix, noise as carrier) reprice meaning at the end without moralizing. The colleague’s return adds layered subtext about absence and co‑agency. The resonance lingers without prescriptive takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through action: patience and vigilance as architecture countering spectacle or force. Recurring images (crowns vs. the plain band; seeds of vigilance; safes as dilemmas) reweight meaning at the end as the city subtly shifts. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“I am not gathering loot; I am composing the patience the city needs”), slightly blunt amid otherwise implicit work. The final quiet image earns reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action and image: art as vessel, reciprocal listening, “empathy in motion” as practiced stance. The ending reweights the premise—music as pulse entrusted to wind and wood—without moralizing. Recurring images (insulator, cracks, roots, breath) accrue and then shift meaning at closure. Resonance lingers in the chosen renunciation and the communal “keeping faith.”

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence vs speech, play vs oath, mercy vs victory; the covenant’s “shadowed side” reweights prior material without sermonizing. Recurring images (stone/hollow, pauses/field) shift meaning at the end. The last lines offer a resonant answer—beauty as held space—without moral summary. A single overt statement (“we would teach it rests and rests”) edges toward thesis but remains earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—empathy via disciplined listening, pacifism as technique—emerges from tactics and images rather than abstraction; the fireworks hush reweights the practice at the end. A single explicit statement (“That is pacifism as technique…”) edges toward didactic but fits the established theatrical sincerity. The final act (co‑signing, anointing the hush) offers a non‑literal answer that revalues attention over conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres through particulars: rot as balance, motion needing calm, wisdom as undercurrent rather than stasis. The corpse flower reweights grief and communal decision-making without sermonizing; the flies’ line toes the edge of explicitness but is dramatized via her unique sense. The final shift to stewardship is a resonant, non-literal answer. Recurring images (spirals, ropes, breath) accrue meaning credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of resilience-as-bending emerges through particulars (resin seed heart, water’s path, orchard practice) rather than thesis, culminating in a reweighted final image. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“surviving is not an accident but a practice”), but they’re grounded in object action and don’t lapse into sermon. The grandmother’s bequest and the mended drum thread subtext about inheritance and labor without overtelling. The quiet, charged ending lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (“foresight in action,” “singular convergence,” “hazy precision”) emerges through repeated, reweighted particulars, not lecture. The patch’s reprise and the refusal to cheer enact a disciplined ethic over heroics. A few explicit lines risk thesis‑scent (“Hazy precision is an ethic”), but they harmonize with the character’s occupational idiom. The ending offers a resonant non‑moral answer: attention and refusal as salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through patterned action (ritual as labor/prayer) and objects (bell, amber sheet) rather than overt sermonizing. The final repricing—hush as a public standard—delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer. One minor on‑the‑nose repetition (“to certify wonder as essential” twice) trims subtlety. Subtext in the city’s “noise as currency” contrasts convincingly with the consecrated quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of humility in craft, listening versus control, and the ethics of crossing thresholds emerge organically through action. The flute’s shift from shuttle to teacher reframes mastery as obedience to materials. No moralizing; the “ledger of miscounts and pride” reads as earned wisdom. The final gestures (driftwood left for others; apology via ravens) resonate beyond plot without tidy cure for loss.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars—the act of printing, the halo’s conduction, the star ledger—rather than thesis statements. The line “Transposed empathy is not charity…a trading of coordinates” refracts throughout and is repriced by the final appeal to the sky. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about shared grief and accountability without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers as earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of coaxed wonder versus grief’s erosion emerges through particulars: bone tube/yew, breath/pitch, ridge hum. The final image reweights the premise into “planting continuance” with a conceptual cost and earned ambiguity (courier or gardener). No sermonizing; lines like “miracles should not be kept past their flavor” arise from scene truth. The mentor’s absence refracts meaning without tidy consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of memory, witnessing, and “truthful lies” emerge from scene action (reading frost, prayer as practice) rather than assertion. Recurring images (hush, prism, frost) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing; the closing sentence offers a durable, non‑tidy answer. Slight explicitness in aphoristic lines (“Because prayers are practical”) keeps it shy of perfect subtlety, but the subtext between belief and grief is strong. The conceptual repricing of objects’ moral stance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of connection across ruin, borders vs. openness, and sacrificial communication emerge organically through objects and acts (edges to frame, then bury; amber as witness). The final image reweights the premise: after passage, borders are laid to rest beneath the witness. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (apricots, gate creak, lantern handle). Thematic complexity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of honesty, communal stewardship, and earned steadiness accrue through vows, roots weaving ladders, and the refusal of spectacle. “Bartered awakenings” reframes exchange and responsibility with a felt price at the climax. One explicit line risks moralizing (“We were not saved by spectacle”) but is supported by prior particulars. The final bells in “azure defiance” reweight belief and proof without didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through motifs (redirect, mapping, smell) and actions: truth kept vs. erased, responsibility woven into routes others can survive. The mother’s silence becomes love/terror, reweighted at the end without moralizing. The final image—redirecting the lost one heartbeat per world—offers resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext operates in the shard’s warmth and the refusal to “decorate ruins.”

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: anonymous care, ritual communication, and the redefinition of safety as luminous ache. The line “Safety is not the absence of loss…” edges toward thesis-statement candor, but surrounding imagery earns it. The final taste image (candle smoke, salt, softened paper) reprices the whole system without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silence (the skipper’s unread question) deepens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of post‑print meaning, stewardship, and joy as ballast emerge organically from concrete acts (steering, feeding names to storms, teaching the “alphabet of reefs”). The final headline—“weathered joy”—reprices the world without a sermon. Recurring images (light/shadow, laughter, TIR, green glass) shift meaning by the end. Insight feels earned rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—attention as ethical posture—emerges through concrete craft and light, not lecture, and the final image reweights prior material. One line flirts with thesis (“magnetism was not greed but posture”), but it’s earned by prior beats and anchored to action. Subtext breathes in images (ash, sapphires, lighthouse) and in the donor heart’s “borrowed pulse.” Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from repair-as-witness and the ethics of measuring sorrow; “measured grief will float” is aphoristic yet earned by concrete acts. The final image reweights prior motifs (sextant, minutes, dust) without moralizing. Trees as patient witnesses offer a nuanced stance on time, attention, and grief that lingers. Subtext runs through tools, tags, and administrative miracle instead of thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around communal repair and the ethics of binding/letting‑go; recurring images (swaddling, loom, debts to harmonies) reweight meaning at the end. The line “We rekindle a dying realm by letting it swaddle itself...” edges toward stating the thesis, but it’s earned by prior particulars. The final image (light that negotiates with night; shared scars) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    The paradox motif integrates organically—“shelve things in their opposites”—and culminates in a non‑literal answer: mistake as place rather than verdict. Subtext works through images (lantern, ledger, front door) and indirection in dialogue. One line approaches thesis (“We learned that a mistake can be a place…”) yet it’s dramatized via the joint reading, avoiding sermon. The final city‑mercy image reverberates with the story’s recalibrated boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of urban erasure, communal memory, and ritual care emerge through image and act rather than moralizing. The line “no miracle, only careful company” reframes the story’s sacred/ordinary axis without sermonizing. Subtext in the cashier’s details (rent hike, oven crack, lines as scaffolding) enriches the critique of “creeping normality.” Minor explicit statements of intent exist but are earned by concrete acts.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of memory, naming absence, and ethical custodianship emerge through concrete acts (measuring gaps, filing shadows). Recurring images (light, birds, glass) are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The conceptual repricing—promising to anchor even the vanishing and false—complicates purity, avoiding tidy binaries. The final refraction with the mentor deepens lineage and obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Trust, silence, and the ethics of witnessing are woven through objects and acts rather than stated, with the watch fob’s “careful conscience” and the hush’s enforced patience reframing justice as a kind of break. The final repricing—“even justice sounded like something breaking”—rides earned particulars instead of a moral. Subtext thrives in gestures (reach, recoil) and the gagged accusation. A hair more resistance to her own method’s coldness could push into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres: stewardship over spectacle, democracy of the non-human, and belief made tactile through taste. Images reprice the premise at the end (“north” becoming “us,” sky belonging to ground). Dialogue carries subtext instead of moralizing, and the final vow provides a non-literal answer to the opening question. Ambiguity remains meaningful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of calling vs. commerce, memory vs. action, and artistic lineage emerge from particulars (mnemonics, contract, decoy painting, jar of dawn). The refrain “after the last echo of laughter fades” evolves from mood-setting to a threshold marker for true work. The ending reweights the premise—memory becomes action—as she vows public authorship with Vera. No moralizing; resonance is carried by concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme coheres through recurrent, reweighted particulars: leaves that drink candor, jars of unsent truths, “mercy” without consent. The ending offers a resonant answer—truth as shared water—without moralizing, revaluing the archive from control to communal sustenance. Subtext in the postmaster’s trembling and the narrator’s bodily wilt keeps the argument lived, not stated. One aphoristic line skirts neatness but remains grounded by scene cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic throughline—truth vs. wonder, language vs. resonance—emerges from action, not sermon. The music “answers with clarity no sentence could sustain,” and the ending reweights meaning (bow-as-punctuation; Iri’s charged endurance). Ambiguity is purposeful: both sides’ fears are legible, but the story stakes its stance in the chosen medium. No platitudes or overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—the tin of fears, the compass drift, the controlled burn—to answer how to live in flux: contain chaos without denial. The final insight (“workable storm”) reweights earlier images and avoids false symmetry. One sentence edges toward moralizing (“That is how you survive a world that moves under you”), but it’s earned by the preceding action and image. Subtext carries through image rather than lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: attention as medicine, community countering commodification; the unlocked letters provide a resonant, non‑literal answer. Recurrences (listening, breath, thread/hairpin) reprice meaning at the end. A few thesis‑like lines (“Leadership happens here by listening,” “we heal in the hearing”) flirt with didacticism. Overall, the piece earns its insight through scene rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Encrypt vulnerability as strength” is dramatized through hesitations and stutters becoming code, not told as thesis. The Warden “forgives answers but not doubt” reframes the moral calculus and pays off as the operative key. The finale reweights prior motifs (web, dice, margins) without moralizing. Subtext of survivor grammar and embodied resistance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of custodianship—what it means to “keep” light and memory—emerges organically via work, salt, and gravity. The ending’s repricing (“what my work really keeps”) is earned by the corridor/library retrieval and avoids moralizing. Recurring images (lanterns, tin, whale) shift meaning to deliver a resonant answer about preserving paths through change. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around listening as mercy versus mechanized destiny (“a sun trapped in gears”). Recurring images (flow, grammar, wing) reconfigure by the end into a modest, duty‑bound ethic (“Go... keep listening”). One explicit line (“I do not erase; I release...”) edges toward thesis, but it’s grounded by concrete action and not overbearing. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing, with lingering ambiguity about future vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres: shelter, “agreed upon lies,” and the ethics of mercy braided with architecture. Subtext is carried in ritual and silence (wax seal before difficulty; the corridor that never existed), avoiding sermonizing. The ending reweights everything—buildings as repositories of human weather—and offers a resonant answer: be precise, merciful, and responsible with truth. No platitudes; the insight is earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of solitude, stewardship, and carrying sorrow “usefully” emerge through image and action, not mere assertion. Recurring images (weather/sea/library) reweight at the end into an ethic of readiness and clean carriage. A few aphoristic lines (“So much of life is anteroom and afterthought…”) edge toward told wisdom, but the scene earns them. Subtext (ritual, consent, debt to the singer and garden) resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: mercy as an act of unlinking and patience, justice disguised as cursive, forgiveness of the unfinished. Recurring images reweight at the end (key, blank margin, thorn taking root), offering a resonant answer without moralizing. The single explicit defense (“I did not betray you…”) is justified by scene and does not cheapen the subtext. The afterimage—room left for grief/time—is potent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme coheres: echo as debt/bond, speech as a hinge, forgiveness and obligation knitting names to mouths. The mother’s pot-song return reframes echo as communal and costly rather than mystical flair, and Lio’s vow resists platitude by tying kindness to clarity. One line edges toward didactic summary (“So that is why some people echo”), but the surrounding images keep resonance earned. Subtext operates in the environment’s replies, avoiding sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres through particulars: truth as careful stewardship, communal witness as justice, memory as tide. The snow globe and “borrowed starlight” reweight at the end, resisting moralizing while offering a resonant answer: exposure as a gentle blade that permits healing. Subtext (the ethics of revealing, the dead’s insistence) operates in image rather than assertion. Complexity holds without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—valuing hidden effort and tenderness under strain—emerges organically from concrete acts (knot‑mending, froth‑reading, drying stones). Recurring images (nets, whisk, fireflies) reweight at the end without didactic summary; “We do not clap, because clapping breaks things” is a potent subtextual refusal. The final gift reframes power and attention as practices, not pronouncements. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—design over myth, imperfection as utility, truth as maintenance—emerges through object and deed. Recurring images (flawed diamond, stillpoint, irrigation lines) reweight at the end. A few explicit theses (“Comfortable lies cost less…”) flirt with sermonizing, slightly blunting subtext. Overall, the final image answers the premise without needing explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Power, hunger, faith, and hubris braid through repeating images—maps that “unfold us,” the heart‑as‑conductor, seeds into lightning—without moralizing. The ending reweights the central question (who owes allegiance to what) as the town “listened differently,” a non‑literal answer earned by scene work. Subtext (mother/midwife to a pattern) deepens communal transformation. Resonance lingers without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from acts of listening, exchange, and relinquishment; “gleaned redemption” is earned rather than asserted. Subtext radiates through images (ballerina as hinge, lighthouse tick) instead of moralizing. The ending answers the central question—how to hold memory and air—by repricing the narrator’s role. Complexity remains: the cost of ceasing the jar‑trade haunts the chosen quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of adaptation over force, forgiveness by alignment, and grief re‑tuned into responsibility emerge through action and image (breath tuning, “drowned orchards and rebuilt towns”). The final shared stewardship reweights the premise without moralizing. One explicit thesis line (“Sonic absolution… a way of tuning yourself…”) edges toward statement, but it’s paid off behaviorally. Resonance lingers in the lighthouse’s “rib set back in place.”

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—transforming rage into form via attention and craft—emerges from concrete acts (moon-tracking, salt-carrying, cleaning iron dust). The “school not storm” line risks overt statement but feels earned by prior patterning and choice. The closing image reweights earlier motifs without tidy moral closure. Subtext lives in the shift from watching to teaching and in communal adoption of restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of communal safety, authority pressure, and memory-as-infrastructure arise from objects and acts rather than lecture. The lantern’s historical freight reweights the present, and the final image reframes evidence vs. use. A few direct statements edge toward thesis (“Breaking free… is not rebellion”), slightly reducing the subtext’s quiet power. Overall resonance lingers and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of guilt as gravity, repair vs. redemption, and time as moral practice bloom through image and action rather than essay. Subtext rides the machine–human analogy with restraint, culminating in “a heart is not forgiven by getting fixed; it is forgiven by keeping time.” A couple aphoristic lines edge toward pronouncement, but they’re earned by scene pressure and character voice. The final reweighting lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: yearning as motor, prayer disguised as engineering, guidance vs control. Recurring images (kaleidoscope, arrow hinge, bell) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The “bell in readiness” reframes success as responsibility, a conceptual repricing that lingers. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, institutional erasure, and grief are integrated through concrete acts (data paths, patches, playlists). Recurring images (numbers, “echo of forgotten songs,” the patch) reweight meaning at the end without sermonizing. One line edges toward thesis (“the largest lie was the one embedded in policy”), but it’s earned by prior discovery. The final surge of profiles reframes “absence” without tidy moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of reparative justice, communal practice over prophecy, and guilt-as-compost arise from image and action rather than lecture. The “courageous anomaly” reframing of the child threads ethics into record-keeping and future duty. A few aphoristic lines (“guilt would be compost, not a flag”) flirt with didacticism but feel earned by prior particulars. The final note reweights the premise toward practice, not revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: listening as an ethic, patience redefined, endings that want to be seen. Recurrent images (rope that “remembers,” whistle that stays quiet, parasol tip) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. Dialogue carries subtext rather than thesis, even in aphoristic lines from Erland. The final walk along the “margin of mercy” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of compatibility, ritual, and truthful boundaries arise through concrete acts and images (grafting parallels, sealing the scar into the future). Subtext operates in the tools and the map’s re-inscription rather than moral. One line edges toward thesis (“We will not judge love tonight”), but overall the final cadence reweights prior motifs with resonance. The story sustains complexity without tidy absolutes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Echo vs blare, humility, and attention-at-the-margins accrue through ritual and image, not moralizing. The final sealed cup and vow to continue reprice prophecy as vessel rather than trumpet. Subtext in restraint—“We consecrate the record by not speaking over it”—feels earned. Depth is high, though the piece skirts transcendence rather than confronts a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of communal memory, ritualized repair, and transforming labor into art emerge through particulars (twine, ribbons, field rows, mirror). Subtext operates in images (humor as hallway; mirror binding faces to light) rather than sermonizing, despite one direct articulation of aim. The final acts offer a resonant, non‑literal answer: healing as a walkable map learned by feet. Ambiguity remains (unnamed trembling spots), enriching aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: growth as refusal made porous, tending as grammar, forgiveness through time, and language migrating beyond print. The final image reweights the premise without preaching; the crystal’s music as testimony is an embodied answer. A single explicit line (“Words do not end…”) risks thesis‑speak but is counterbalanced by scene‑rooted images. Resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically: memory as echo, aging as a midnote between youth and grief, accompaniment over mastery. Recurring objects (chalk, driftwood, fog) accrue meaning and are reweighted in the closing image. The “midnote where both agreed to sing” culminates in a stance that reframes the quest from capture to companionship. No moralizing; resonance lingers with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: listening to “noise,” humility before the supposedly “changeless” Moon, and answering faint signals. The leaf motif reweights meaning at the end, tying early patience to the final stance. One near‑thesis line (“We would unlearn...”) is earned by the scene’s struggle. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: care as craft, joy as something sharp, and hope as scent and attention to the ordinary. The shard/gauze motif reweights meaning at the end, avoiding sermonizing while landing deep regret and gentleness. Subtext in dialogue and silence (“It stopped, but you can still dance”) carries the moral calculus. The final held note enacts meaning rather than stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: loops, contracts, and “sealed awakenings” reframe knowledge and loss as kept agreements. The shadows’ chorus (“Noon is an agreement...”) functions as embodied subtext rather than moral, later cashed out by the signature under the skin. The final image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing, inviting reflection on decision and memory. Resonance lingers with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of mercy over myth, grief’s mineral residue, and “turning mistakes into constellations” emerge from objects and acts (tooth, map, bone‑setting) rather than sermon. The final “bright bones of the sky” reweights prior motifs without a stated moral. A single explicit sentence (“My motive was simple…”) edges toward telling, but the surrounding images earn it. Ambiguity around blame and myth stays productive.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of patience vs. quickness, gentleness vs. blaze, and listening as a form of light emerge organically from craft and ritual. “A pearl of stillness” reframes motion settling into depth; the village’s calm is felt, not told, avoiding moralizing. The brother’s offstage arc adds a counterpoint that enriches the final invitation to anchor. The closing image answers the central question with resonant humility.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: consent vs. spectacle, art’s ethics, and transformation (servers to ferns; silence to speech). The pendant’s interment reframes ownership and memory without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the initial wound. “I will not make art from you/I will not make silence from you” crystallizes mutual boundaries while preserving ambiguity. The final drip‑counting in the hush yields a charged poise that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: emblems as “shapes of different hopes,” upstream letter, contrary thread. The final choice reframes the piece as arranging permissions rather than imposing resolutions—clean CR that resonates. One line edges toward thesis (“stop seeking resolution and start arranging permission”), but the surrounding images keep it earned. The aftereffect is contemplative rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of attention, consent with the natural world, and communal repair emerge organically from action (listening as structure; songs as maps; remedies preferring collective hands). The final understanding reweights prior material without a spelled‑out moral, and images carry meaning (mended bowls; warmed jars; the grove “agreeing to meet us”). One line verges on thesis (“alignment is not precision but consent”) but it’s embedded in scene and supported by enactment. Resonance lingers without tidy didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: patient stewardship translating life’s pulse into guidance, with responsibility to others and a debt to the past (the sister) refracted through action. Recurring images (heartbeat, breath, ladders, wolves on the plate) reweight at the end when the world “exhales.” There’s no moralizing; the final image offers a resonant answer about relational duty and making paths from what still lives. Ambiguity remains purposeful and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: locks as compacts, time as taught by sound, wonder stewarded rather than owned. Recurring images (angles, jars, glints, the timer) reweight at the end—stewardship replaces extraction with a cost. The story refuses tidy moralizing while landing a resonant non-literal answer in the final image. The “some keys should stay where they learn” line crystallizes the ethic without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of grief’s weight, naming, and ethical handling emerge through image and action, not moralizing. Recurrences (“shingled hush,” coins, ledger, breath/orientation) revalue at the end, offering an answer: not to lessen but to place burdens truthfully. The soldier/widow beats complicate any tidy universal. The final reframe to “duty” carries conceptual price without didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: here/gone, hinge, trust, and the ethics of leaving absence intact. Recurring images (knot, lenses, collar, whistle) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The line “If you must be here and gone, teach me the hinge” crystallizes the inquiry and the final tableau answers it by practiced restraint. Resonance lingers, avoiding tidy prescription.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of regret, authenticity, and sustainable rebuilding emerge from particulars (penny city dissolving; ambitions composted into garden sand) rather than assertion. Subtext operates through images (bridge of murmurs, bone‑arithmetic clicks), and the final stance reframes ambition as habit. One near‑didactic line (“the only contract worth signing…”) is justified by the ghost’s role and does not cheapen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—hope as a system—emerges from specific acts (valves, breakers, rerouting) and the sextant’s non-literal guidance. The final moments reweight the premise toward maintenance and communal care without sentimentality. One explicit line (“hope is engineered...”) edges toward stating the thesis, but it’s earned by prior scene work. Subtext in the janitor’s laugh and the sinks “speaking mathematics” lands with restrained grace.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: befriending absence, shame as a mask for tenderness, and endurance as music. The finch, the bell-that-never-rang, and weather reweight prior material without moralizing. The final image answers the central question with a non-literal, resonant stance—meeting the dream without demand. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: tools of truth must “ride with the hour,” institutions script floods, radio silence abets erasure. The engineer’s line (“the water does not speak and the pay came steady”) carries subtext about complicity and silence. The ending reframes the premise without moralizing, offering a non‑literal answer—truth as tidal correction—rooted in action. No sermonizing; ambiguity is purposeful and humane.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of attention as stewardship, memory embedded in matter, and intergenerational trust emerge from particulars (clove hitch drought, bowline tenderness, frayed mercy). The aphoristic line “You coax life with attention…” is earned by prior action and reweights the final care‑image. The ending reframes listening as communal (fisherman, weavers, harbor) without moralizing. Resonance lingers through image rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Absence/presence is explored through concrete acts (boots by the hearth; the humming thread; the space beside the teacup as “small inland sea”). The final repricing is precise and unsentimental: he has “died to the shape,” transforming grief’s frame without neat moral. Recurring images (harbor, thread, quince) accrue meaning and resolve in a resonant, non‑literal answer. No sermonizing; ambiguity feels purposeful and humane.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of repair over conquest and mending a flawed genesis arise through concrete acts (tuning, waiting, renunciation) and the hybrid creature’s song restoring color. The line “He realized the past could not be undone” edges toward explicitness but is earned by scene work and immediately grounded in action. The final invitation to vines and idling mills offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains (crossroads creature) in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of transmutation and memory (fire to water, ash to glass, wound to song) emerge through action, not thesis. The coin, black sand, and graft accrue meaning and reweight the final images (“opposite of a fuse”). One line edges toward explicit moral (“not silence, not shame”), but the piece largely trusts image and ritual to carry meaning. Resonance lingers with conceptual repricing of scars as music.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of memory, patience, and responsible skepticism emerges organically from images and choices (refusing torrents that “wash away the careful vowels”). Subtext in the water woman’s counsel and the broker’s shaken retreat carries moral texture without sermonizing. The final explicit line—“patience was not waiting but remembering together”—tips toward thesis, slightly reducing the afterglow. Even so, the closing image reweights prior motifs credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of non‑devouring light, inheritance, and chosen music emerge through action and motif rather than moralizing. The gear and counting reframe “infinity” from abstraction to practice, giving the final cadence a resonant repricing. One direct injunction (“Do not feed this place flame”) sits within scene pressure, not sermon. Ambiguity lingers in the narrator’s fear of being only an heirloom, enriching the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonance accrues through recurring particulars (ribbon, butterflies, hush), culminating in the spare kite curve as an ethical stance. One explicit thematic line—“Movement…is the shape of our collective grief”—edges toward telling, slightly thinning subtext at a late moment. Otherwise, the piece lets images do the work, and the final action offers a non-literal answer about form, mercy, and distance. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (precision versus consequence; absolution as incremental labor) emerges through particulars: notches as mapped amends, mechanical mercy, tide answering bells. Subtext works in images (wound/needle, bread‑cooling ridge) and the refusal to “correct” at the end. A couple of explicit thesis lines lightly telegraph intent, but the closing action image reweights prior material without moralizing. The resonance lingers as communal, not individual, redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme crystallizes from particulars: mercy versus truth, intention’s “shape,” and the grammar of borders. Recurring images (clock flags, echoes, thread, case) reweight at the end into a stance of mercy that still names absence. No sermonizing; the widow’s duality and the gardener’s response hold complexity. The final cadence repositions gossip into mercy with a felt human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of constraint-as-care, hinge over wall, and endurance vs. spectacle develop organically from modeling and environment; the bird’s reading of fractures elegantly reframes innovation. A few lines in the penultimate section tilt toward aphoristic articulation (“Because we chose a hinge...”), slightly on-the-nose. Still, the charged final image resists a tidy moral and leaves resonant ambiguity about cost and stewardship. Subtext runs through objects (beads, threads, shutters) rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—listening as craft and responsibility after cultural collapse—emerges organically through tasks and images (naming silences, breath as hinge). The coda materially reweights the premise: art requires secrecy, patience, and stewardship, not revelation. Subtext hums in metaphors of notation and kiln‑breath without moralizing. The final cadence (keeping time in sleep) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic integration is strong: “mirage of safety,” kintsugi, incomplete information, and the chair’s rhythm converge to answer how truth can be told without direct naming. Subtext runs through objects and silence, and the final image reweights prior material. A few lines edge toward thematic stating (“danger cannot bear to be named outright”), softening the subtlety. Even so, the resonance lingers with complexity and no tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through action: method vs myth, rebellion as repair, respect for the dead via practice not worship. The cog’s repricing from “emblem” to “tool” delivers the thematic answer without moralizing. A few aphoristic lines risk overstatement (“the healthiest disease is certainty”) but are earned by concrete stakes and the closing enactment. The ending resonates conceptually and emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme (“listening over slogans,” “subtracting noise”) arises from practice and image, not mere assertion, and reweights at the end. A few explicit lines (“listening is a muscle,” “caretakers of vanishing arts”) skate close to telling, but they are earned by scene pressure and object history. Subtext runs through gesture (the rosette offered like safe passage) and structural rests. The final silence and warm rosette crystallize a non‑moralized answer: fragile harmony is an enacted discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of communal healing, stewardship of memory, and refusal to hate culminate in the shared soup and the line “We began rebuilding with flavors,” a non‑literal answer to the central question. Recurring objects (seed, copper, fingerprints) reweight themselves at the end. One overt aphorism (“People think rebellion is noise...”) flirts with telling, but most resonance rises from enacted particulars. The ordinance beat adds moral calculus without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: wonder as currency and ritual as the antidote to forgetful functionality, embodied in toll-taking by riddle and the queen tone’s restorative song. The ending reweights the premise—“payment that keeps my work alive” and the drones as punctuation completing thought. A couple of declarative lines flirt with direct statement, but emerge credibly from the narrator’s ethos. The final image resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme crystallizes organically: aliveness is bestowed by human attention and ritual, not innate essence. Recurring images (shard of hush, displaced objects, sanctification) earn their resonance without moralizing. The ending offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior detail and lingers. Ambiguity remains purposeful (alive “for itself” vs. “to shelter a story”).

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme integrates cleanly: hesitation as strategy; truth as multi-rung ladder; weakness as conduit. Recurring images (ampoule, benches, breach as “listening wound”) evolve meaningfully to deliver a non-literal answer. A few near-thesis lines (“The garden had not killed to save; it had stalled…”) edge toward explicit statement, slightly reducing the afterglow. The final poise—arguing in patience—lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Regret as engine, bias as truth, and motion honoring stillness weave through concrete images (chipped die, mirror‑breath, chalk proofs). The final reconfiguration offers a resonant answer: accept skew and labor to remember precisely rather than exit. A slight tilt toward declarative thematics (“The proof says…”) trims the mystique without collapsing into sermon. Subtext remains strong in how fairness is “achieved by confession.”

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of remembered kindness and “lost languages” emerge through images and action (gold seed dots, alley faces speaking, city learning to read gestures). The “Not a miracle… old grammar of decency” line risks thesis-stating but remains in-voice and not the final word. The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing, offering a resonant, communal answer. Subtext operates in offerings and silence with the neighbor.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around nourishment as memory—bread, wax, honey, and names as edible testimony—without moralizing. The lens reweights care/curation as an ethical filter; the vow to “keep our names warm” finds a non-literal answer in eating one’s own initial while remembering another. Subtext about authority, selection, and communal grief is carried in ritual, not thesis. The closing reprices history as embodied, perishable, and sustained through shared appetite and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Control vs. surrender, hunger vs. trust, and ethical choice over power emerge organically from image and action, not thesis. The “latent radiance” that becomes legible mirrors the protagonist’s reweighted desire. The final choice answers the central question without moralizing, leaving resonant complexity (personal love/responsibility over cosmic escape). Ambiguity around the futures sustains meaningful aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of attention as creation/erasure and fear’s dependence on rules emerges through concrete acts (paradox entries, mirrors, camera) rather than abstract sermon. The confession reweights prior motifs; the final image of escaping through “daylight disguised as a crack in painted night” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext in the advisor’s economy of fear (“fear owes me money”) enriches without explaining. No moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: artful naming/arrangement converts violence into cooperative rhythm, rethinking control as collaboration with forces. The final image—listening to clouds “rewrite their letters into silence”—reprices the whole premise with grace. Recurrences (resonance, dubbing, instruments) deepen meaning rather than decorate. No moral is stated; resonance is earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres without moralizing: questions vs. mercy, measurement vs. humanity, inheritance of risk, and the ethics of being “counted.” The watchers’ answer—spacing as response—reweights the world and reframes the lost expedition as a unit of distance. The final image rings with conceptual cost and refuses tidy comfort. Recurring objects (whistle, lattice) convert symbolism into action.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the artifacts and the stationmaster’s margins; the “noble lies” calculus is reweighted by “Listen.” Subtext in repeated objects (ledger, tulips, compass) supports the moral complexity. A few explicit statements (“tell the truth without contempt”) lean toward thesis, muting ambiguity slightly. Nonetheless, the ending reconfigures the premise without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of witness over repair and “interlaced absence” grows from concrete acts (hiding notes in mortar, mapping light coins) and culminates in a resonant refusal. “Hushed blaze” reframes restraint as an ethical heat and returns at closure. One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“I was here not to repair the past...”), slightly on‑the‑nose but anchored as the content of a slip, mitigating sermonizing. The ending reweights prior images without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of authorship, complicity, and the ethics of record‑keeping emerges organically from action (stamping, reading, revealing redactions), not commentary. “Lowered, not lost” converts the premise into indictment without sermonizing. Recurring images (hum vs. hush, violet oval, lacquered resolve) accrue and shift meaning at the end. Ambiguity remains meaningful—no tidy moral—but the stance is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Craft as mourning and transformation (“thicken light,” “sip dreams”) integrates theme without moralizing, culminating in a resonant answer: acceptance and redistribution of pain rather than restoration. Recurring images (ribbons, cranes, lenses) reweight at the end. Ambiguity is meaningful—loss remains—and the afterimage lingers. No overt thesis statements intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around harvesting slack/unused will, survivorship, and the ethics of listening; images reprise with reweighted meaning (cathedral, fans, hush). Insights feel earned through specific, technical ritual rather than abstraction, and the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (charged vigilance over mastery). A few lines flirt with statement (“what I gather is the unspent will of the world”) but remain supported by scene texture. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through enacted images (letters/orbits kin, cracks as punctuation, silence as letter) and culminates in a non‑literal answer. Subtext runs in the pilgrim’s tremor and the observatory “leaning in,” with a persuasive reframing of belonging as tuned frequency. Slight deduction for explicitness in the final printed directive, which edges toward stating the thesis. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory, invention, and ethical record‑keeping arise from particulars, not pronouncements. Recurring images (tide, ledger, watch hand, hush) accrue and then pivot meaningfully: time “loses a hand” yet still points, reframing protection vs. truth. The “publish not in courts but in kitchens” line broadens social stakes without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains humane (Mara’s tempered regret), producing a lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through recurring particulars: neutral ground, “recycling mistakes,” moon‑coin/desk‑coin imagery, and “harvest” of the past. The drawer pull’s “two stories” line reweights meaning at the peak and in the final cool metal image. A few lines approach thesis‑statement clarity (“We are here to untether...”), mildly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is earned through action: service as a countercurrent to regret reconfigures the narrator’s self‑regard without sermonizing. Recurring images (compass, poles, gulls) shift meaning by the last paragraph to answer the central question. The final admission (“sorrow…like a chart, open and used”) resists tidy moral and lingers. Subtext hums beneath sparse dialogue and image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of manufactured apathy vs. earned empathy emerges through concrete particulars (negative-space newspapers; “We weaponized fatigue”). Subtext in imagery (lake’s “useful ache,” jars listening) deepens the moral calculus. Slight explicitness in motive statements is offset by resonant images and a non-moralizing final stance. The ending reweights earlier motifs into a lived ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of grief transmuted into relational permeability emerges through action rather than statement. The “bridge of breaths” and spice-binding render love as practice with cost, not sentiment. The final hum as a “quiet star threaded through two throats” offers a resonant answer to the central question. Ambiguity lingers productively around identity and endurance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: time’s residue in “unused halves of gestures,” motherhood’s ambivalence, ritual as ethical attention. The ending’s refusal to seek immunity from failure and commitment to “where to kneel” reweights the whole with humane rigor. Recurring images (milk, cracks, hands, moons) shift meaning from ornament to ethic without moralizing. Resonance lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme arises organically: compassion that includes shadow, beginnings over conquest, grief as map. The library‑not‑armory reveal and the vow reweight the premise without moralizing. Recurring images (tears, weight, stitching) shift meaning at the end, delivering a resonant, non‑literal answer. The emotional aftereffect is concrete and unsentimental: custodial joy tempered by accepted burden.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme crystallizes through particulars: coincidence as kindness, safety as worship, and transformation’s “texture” over spectacle. The prophecy thread complicates altruism without sermonizing, and the ending reprices myth and agency via the release of light. Subtext moves in images (ribs listening; jars as breadcrumb choir) rather than declarations. The final image reweights the central question with durable ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around consent versus surveillance, spectacle versus hearth, and the ethics of light; recurring images (locks, breath, hush) reweight at the end. Subtext operates in small actions and tools—the quill holder’s shift from ceremonial to functional power. One line edges toward thesis (“A silent revolution is not the absence of sound; it is the consent of doors.”), but it works as image not sermon. The final image answers the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of vow, pattern, sacrifice, and listening emerge organically via image and action. Subtext hums in “messages require distance” and the arithmetic/grammar conceits that reweight mercy and understanding. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“To understand sacred patterns…”) but is voiced in-character and paid off by the cost. The final commitment reframes rescue into attentive stewardship without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of censorship, lineage, and mapping pain into guidance arise through concrete motifs (ash‑constellation, scars-as-topography, timing as witness). Subtext operates in the ritualized pauses and the caretaker’s oblique authority (“as if stillness and velocity had brokered a truce”). The explicit line “This is why I write” edges toward a thesis statement, but it is earned by prior scene‑work and does not flatten the resonance. The ending image reweights prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme (“philosophy worth steel is an address”) emerges from acts, not sermonizing: tools as arguments, patience as muscle, ignorance as a blade. The “hidden overture” refrains and reweights at the gate, offering a resonant non-literal answer: enter the question rather than resolve it. Liese’s mercy line adds ethical texture without tidy moral. The ending’s sensory specifics (“rain on chalk and apple cores”) elevate the repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through action: art as communal resistance and an alternative economy (“pennies inked with phrases”) rather than through sermonizing, with the final exchange crystallizing the ethic. Subtext hums in the prison‑library origin and the re‑shelving of the city’s castoffs; the “index of need” reframes disorder into care. A couple of direct statements (“Beauty is not a treaty…”) skate close to thesis, but they’re earned by the scene’s particulars and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of negotiating with fate, loving timetables without obeying them, emerges through concrete actions and recurring objects rather than moralizing. The encore as wager reframes control versus surrender, and the final hush offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy, and the closing image reweights prior material. A slightly stronger counter‑pressure (visible harm or moral cost) could add further complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: truth-keeping versus myth, communal memory’s fragility, and doubt as a generative ethic. Lines like “water forgets our shapes while remembering our salt” encode subtext without sermonizing. The final reconfiguration—memory sorted, island self-wakening—answers the central question in image, not moral. The empiricism/fairytale tension becomes an ethic of method, not a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of control vs. care, patience vs. fear, and the ethics of shaping others arise through concrete actions (mapping by lace, pruning metaphors reweighted). The final image (cerulean lace, steadied compass, promise to teach differently) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext hums in the bonsai/storm tension and the refusal to “admire how quiet their cages looked.” Ambiguity around the absent “one” preserves complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of patient observation versus dramatic event is seamlessly integrated through the story's central, brilliant metaphor comparing the greenhouse's recovery to a pulsar's slow decay. Subtext is carried elegantly in images like the "shy retreat" of the water and the "earthy arithmetic" of the compost. While a few lines border on being too explicit ("recovery is not a rescue but a rehearsal"), they feel authentic to the voice of a scientist articulating a new hypothesis in her notebook, thus avoiding thematic intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic integration is masterful. The story explores the nature of evidence, memory, and justice through the central metaphor of glassmaking—a process involving heat, cold, pressure, and clarity. The final image of the ledger fused within a glass sheet, a "window only the dawn could read," is a stunning, non-literal resolution that resonates with every preceding element without a single word of explicit moralizing. The theme emerges organically from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, particularly the metaphor of translation and the poignant use of the inert tuning forks. The piece achieves profound resonance. The only slight weakness is the final paragraph's direct thematic statements ("meaning keeps knocking," "proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance"), which verge on summarizing the story's discovery rather than leaving it fully implicit in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic exploration of rest, memory, and belonging is seamlessly integrated into the narrative's imagery and action. The central idea that "rest is not surrender but location" is powerfully dramatized rather than merely stated. The transformation of the distress signal "SOS" into "SOR" (stay or rest) is a brilliant thematic crystallization, and the final image of the library provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the central symbol of the bell and the community's actions. Concepts of dignity, anonymous care, and intergenerational strength are dramatized, not stated. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question of how a community endures, beautifully re-contextualizing the bell from a tool of secret survival to a public monument of gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of releasing hoarded emotion is developed with immense subtlety and power through the central metaphor of breath and the camera obscura. While the line "Unused love, I learn, is stored wherever we resist the exhale" is a direct statement, it reads as a hard-won epiphany rather than authorial moralizing. The final image of the viaduct and the shared breath with the stranger provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is impeccably woven through image and action, never stated. The central question of how to structure grief is explored through the metaphor of maze design, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of the "quaking reverie that holds still" perfectly encapsulates the complex resolution—that peace is found not in escaping grief's labyrinth, but in learning to inhabit its living architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's central images: chains, keys, seeds, and dry soil. The narrative explores resilience not as a single victory but as a continuous, patient act of "tending." The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions, avoiding moralizing in favor of a complex, beautiful image of a future that must be carefully cultivated.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's dense, specific imagery without a single didactic sentence. The concept that memory has a "tone" is explored through action, culminating in the profound insight that "what you save decides what the shattering can no longer erase." The final image of turning trauma into "ballast" provides a resonant, complex answer to the central problem, avoiding sentimentality and offering earned wisdom. It resists a tidy moral, instead offering a sophisticated model for resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of art, memory, and responsibility is deeply integrated and resonant. The story interrogates its core concept of "stealing" moments, contrasting the protagonist's romanticism with the mentor's devastating failure. The final image of the reawakened portraits—"not sunlit, but truthful... a light that admits darkness"—provides a stunning, non-literal resolution. The theme emerges organically from the story’s particulars, culminating in a final line that recharges the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of creating safety by reconciling science and tenderness emerges organically through Arlen's actions and the story's potent imagery. However, the final sentence—"the purpose is to notice what hurts and make space"—is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the preceding subtlety. While beautifully phrased, this direct moralizing replaces earned resonance at the most critical moment, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of vulnerability as a form of power emerges organically from the plot and the protagonist’s actions. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating the theme multiple times ("I needed proof that vulnerability can be power"). This thematic summary, particularly the repetition, prevents the resonance from being fully earned through image and action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the story's central conceit and imagery, exploring meaning in absence without a hint of didacticism. Lines like "reasons are sensations in costumes" are profound yet integrated into character. The final image of the transient booklet and the permanent, blood-scribed stone map provides a complex, resonant answer to the story's central question of what can endure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's resonant core, emerging organically from the fusion of mundane labor and sublime mystery. It masterfully explores consciousness, memory, and the creation of meaning through practice without a single line of didacticism. The final image of the violin shining through the narrator "as if thoughts were light" provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting and complex emotional aftereffect.

The final image of an internal "corridor...that no longer insisted on ladders or wings" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial problem.

    The theme of healing through a different kind of listening emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("She would teach the art of listening backward to move forward," "The hush she carried was no absence, only a way for presence to travel...").

    The theme of recognizing unseen labor and "cycles of compassion" is central and elegantly woven through the narrative. However, the story violates a key principle by having a character explicitly state the theme: "It sounds like cycles of compassion to Jun."

    The theme of care as a subtraction of control emerges organically and with great poignancy from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of magnifying everyday magic is beautifully developed through the contrast between the clairvoyant's grand purpose and the pilgrim's humble history.

The final moments—addressing the children, the general's admission—offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, grounding abstract ideals in the concrete needs for "water that tastes like rain."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of manufactured sentiment, ecological guilt, and the nature of preservation is sophisticated and seamlessly integrated. The story avoids any moralizing, instead offering the complex portrait of a man who uses the tools of destruction to create a private, sterile form of beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.8)

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of honoring transient, "meandering" life is developed with nuance and potent imagery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a few moments, such as the direct articulation that "life preferred meanders," verge on thematic summary, slightly reducing the subtextual power that is otherwise impeccably maintained elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic resonance is powerful and emerges organically from the story's central conceit. Themes of memory, repair, and forgiveness are explored through the concrete actions of casting metal and manipulating the sanctum's machinery. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image where the bells' message evolves beyond simple forgiveness to a call for ongoing work. A single line, "repair begins where the hand loosens its fist," borders on aphorism but is well-integrated enough not to detract significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story masterfully explores its themes of duty, agency, and the transformation of meaning over time without a single line of overt moralizing.

    The theme of devotion expressed through meticulous, empirical work is developed with exceptional subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the narrator’s actions and worldview, culminating in the resonant, non-literal act of writing his name "in strokes so faint they read as sums."

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of pre-verbal trauma and non-linguistic healing is explored with profound originality and emotional honesty. The central metaphor of the broken song is resonant and beautifully sustained. The score is slightly tempered by moments where the theme is stated too directly, such as "memory knows how to clean pain," which reads as an unearned platitude in an otherwise nuanced story. This slightly diminishes the power of the subtext by making it explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of healing through craft, and redefining brokenness as a guide, emerges with grace and power from the story's imagery. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of grief, renewal, and the persistence of memory are woven into the story's fabric with remarkable subtlety and power, primarily through the central metaphor of "deciduous vows." The final image of the ribbon as a bridge between the absent daughter and the present apprentice is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the final sentence, "Call it accidental wisdom, the kind that fixes you while fixing wood," is an unnecessary thematic statement that slightly undermines the preceding artistry by explaining what was already perfectly shown; this thematic echo in the final moments incurs a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of inheritance, inquiry, and the living nature of stories are skillfully woven into the narrative's fabric. However, the story leans into direct thematic statements in its final third, particularly "He understood then that nonlinear inheritance was... about what you let answer" and the final clause about "pages that keep writing us." While eloquent, these moments risk stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the power of the otherwise resonant final images.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of accepting imperfection and finding value in what is lost or unlearned is masterfully woven through every element of the story.

    The theme of absence as a tangible presence is explored with remarkable depth and consistency. The story earns its philosophical reflections through concrete action, culminating in the powerful final line: "bridges are only doors that learned to stay."

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic development is exceptionally well-integrated. The core concept of "hammered repose" is introduced early and revisited in the final moments, creating a powerful, resonant arc about adapting to and accommodating overwhelming forces rather than destroying them. The final line offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, achieving a thematic depth that lingers without any overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in connection and coincidence is beautifully woven through imagery of stitching, threads, and music. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme near the end ("This was not coincidence as shrug; this was coincidence as stitch," and "we rekindled the grammar of belonging"). This thematic moralizing, however beautifully phrased, replaces the trust in subtext that the piece had so masterfully built, slightly diminishing the resonance of an otherwise profound conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of individual versus collective identity is explored with extraordinary subtlety and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of art as a form of hopeful instruction ("serious playfulness") emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. However, the score is capped below the 9-band due to a couple of on-the-nose thematic statements, particularly "This play was our prayer, and this prayer was instruction," which slightly reduces subtext by explicitly stating the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is developed with subtlety and power through the central, recurring metaphors of the cicada and the tide. The story explores the nature of transition and identity without ever resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of tangible vs. intangible safety is explored with extraordinary nuance through contrasting imagery (concrete bunkers vs. cloudgrass cups).

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.5)

    Thematic exploration of memory, resistance, and quiet power is potent and woven through evocative imagery. The final image of the moths spelling a "stubborn grammar" is a brilliant, non-literal resolution. However, the mother's voice stating, "the world keeps the shape of what it resists," verges on an explicit thematic statement. While framed within the story's magical realism, it slightly undermines the otherwise flawless subtext by articulating the thesis too directly at a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is seamlessly integrated, emerging from the central conceits of the "vested hush" and music that shapes "negative space." The story explores duty, memory, and the power of art to prevent rather than create, all without a single line of didacticism. The final image of the incomplete sentence held open and harmless serves as a profound, non-literal resolution to the thematic questions raised.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of interpretation transforming the interpreter is beautifully realized through action and image. However, the final paragraph states the core insight ("what emerges transformed always is the hearer") a bit too directly, a minor slip into telling that slightly undermines an otherwise perfect thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of embracing irregularity over rigid planning is masterfully integrated into every element, from the wandering compass to the water clock. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic integration of balance, measurement, grief, and names is profound and largely emerges from concrete action and imagery. However, a few lines in the final third, such as "To understand the weight of names, I had to weigh my own limits," drift toward explicit thematic statement. While consistent with the character's intellectual voice, this slightly undermines the resonant power of the final image by articulating what was already masterfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.7)

The central theme of integrating joy into healing is explored with nuance, culminating in the powerful re-contextualization of the crocodile tooth from a token of violent survival to a compass of mercy.

The central metaphor of time as currency is executed brilliantly through the mainspring and watch crowns.

The line about turning debts into stories verges on direct statement but is so well-integrated into the character's voice that it enhances rather than detracts from the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of necessary imperfection ("survivable asymmetry") emerges organically from every element of the story, from the setting's physics to the character's core trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of listening, honesty, and repair as an antidote to ownership is beautifully woven throughout the narrative and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the story falters slightly in the penultimate paragraph with a "thematic echo."

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of memory, grief, and the limits of explanation is explored with exceptional subtlety and depth.

The idea of finding a voice in scars—first in the cylinders, then metaphorically—is powerful. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "Thematic Echo" by explicitly stating the story's moral: "every scar, if listened to, speaks in colors the living can learn." This moment of telling slightly undermines the immense trust built with the reader through resonant imagery, constituting a notable flaw in an otherwise stellar piece.

The final image of the shared compass offers a resonant, complex answer that lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's heart, emerging organically from its dense, specific imagery. The central question—how we create a coherent identity from a chaotic life—is explored through the powerful metaphor of mapping "sleeping weather." The piece avoids any hint of moralizing; instead, its final image offers a complex, non-literal answer embodied in "jaded wonder," a coffee "bitter as spruce pitch, sweet as a thaw you do not trust." This ending reweights the entire story, achieving a rare and lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic resonance is powerful and emergent, avoiding any hint of didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of transforming pain into strength by reframing past beliefs is woven beautifully throughout the narrative's central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question. The only minor friction is the line, "By revisiting youthful superstitions, I am not returning to fear but to the doorways fear traced...," which verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly lessening the subtext in an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of "imperfect miracles"—of using the tools of one's destruction for redemption—emerges organically from the character's specific history and choices. The central concept of melody as "a rumor that survives its witnesses" is beautifully integrated. The final image of the clumsy, shared nocturne provides a resonant, non-literal resolution that avoids sentimentality and perfectly embodies the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.7)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven through recurring, evolving images—the key, the water, the razor's edge—rather than stated. The final realization about shepherding "edges" is a profound and non-literal answer to the opening question, re-contextualizing time, memory, and labor. The final image, with the grandmother's reflection and the key marked by blood, provides a resonant, emotionally complex cadence without a shred of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic integration is profound, with the concept of "permeable barriers" resonating across security, grief, and mycology. The final image of the "quiet wildfire" provides a stunning, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. A minor deduction is for the line "What begins as vigilance can become hospitality," which borders on a direct thematic statement, slightly lessening the power of the subtext in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric with remarkable subtlety and power. The central concept of lucid contradictions emerges organically from character and action, culminating in a resonant, non-literal resolution. The final image—the library windows receding "like numbered squares" as the protagonist feels the odds change—is a perfect encapsulation of the story's thematic journey without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of connection, endings, and beginnings is thoughtfully integrated into the premise. However, the story doesn't fully trust its subtext, repeatedly stating its themes directly. Lines like "Mara's motive was simple and impossible: to teach endings how to begin" and the summary in the final paragraphs ("She kept cultivating estrangement the way a gardener prunes...") are thematic echoes that reduce the resonant power of the piece's excellent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of small moments constituting the true weight of a relationship is developed with masterful subtlety. It emerges organically from the plot's central conceit ("proximate causes") rather than through exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.8)

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the central metaphor of emotional cartography. The narrative powerfully argues for knowing one's sorrow rather than conquering it, a concept that resists tidy morals. The final image of the map as "a planet the size of an ache" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The piece achieves a rare emotional honesty without a single sentimental line.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength. It explores guilt, causality, and the power of intention without a single line of overt moralizing. The core concept of "editing history" serves as a profound metaphor for reframing one's past. The final line—"If any of this sounds like prayer, remember it is also a manual for ladders"—is a stunning Conceptual Repricing, offering a non-literal answer to the story's questions that is both transcendent and deeply practical.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is executed with masterful subtlety. The story explores absence, memory, and the nature of art through a constellation of concrete images—the filmless camera, the advisor's whisper, the map washed by the tide. The final image of the silent song carried into the city offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, resisting easy moralizing and leaving a powerful, lingering ambiguity. This is thematic work of the highest order.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.4)

The concept of becoming "broader than our names" is a resonant and earned thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—that quiet, attentive methods are superior to brute force in a complex environment—emerges organically from every action and image. It's demonstrated through Ivo's success before being articulated in the final, resonant line. The subtextual function of the coin, reminding him "to listen for the quieter thing," perfectly encapsulates the theme without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration of silent communication and healing is profound, emerging entirely from the story's concrete particulars without a whisper of moralizing.

The final image of the town cradling questions provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic exploration of identity, vulnerability, and redefined strength is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The central metaphor of the pirate who carves maps of courage instead of throats is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration is the story's greatest strength. It moves beyond a simple dystopia to a nuanced meditation on grief, performance, and resistance.

The final line of dialogue acts as a resonant, non-literal thesis that recharges every image that came before it, offering a complex answer to the story's central question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of dissolving boundaries through gentle reinterpretation rather than violent confrontation is developed with extraordinary grace.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)

Concepts like grief as a "hinge" and the power of "intention" are grounded in concrete rituals, avoiding abstraction. While a few lines border on direct thematic statement ("intention honors even the broken plans"), they are delivered in earned, dramatic moments that prevent them from feeling like authorial intrusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about loss and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is the story's core strength, emerging organically from the cartomancer’s unique practice. The narrative powerfully explores resilience, the redefinition of value, and practical versus speculative hope. While the cartomancer's explanations verge on direct statement ("We were not fortune-telling..."), they function as diegetic teaching and are immediately followed by dramatization, earning their place. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of knowledge as a form of responsible love emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery and symbolic journey.

The concept of belief—how it thrives, how it sickens ("Beliefs can blacken when blood stops moving through them"), and how it can be rebuilt—is explored without sermonizing. The final image of the tail tip and the brochure is a stunning, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. A minor deduction for a few lines that verge on stating their thematic purpose, such as "certainty is a predator, and doubt a steward."

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic exploration of grief, scars, and the nature of closure is sophisticated and deeply woven into the story's imagery. The central metaphor of reading scars in various forms is powerful. However, the final sentence ("closure is not a gate but a garden I will learn...") slips into thematic summary, slightly undermining the preceding scene's resonant power by stating the moral too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the central metaphor of the warehouse. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex, poignant redefinition of its core concept in the final beats ("in the breath before yes"). The closing image of the newly written letter provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s initial question, leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story masterfully weaves its themes through potent, recurring imagery like the "unwritten calendar" and "remembered stardust." However, the final sentence, "The city says she hears unspoken words," is an overt thematic summary that undermines the preceding resonant image of the night learning to speak. This explicit declaration is a significant flaw, stating what was already powerfully demonstrated and weakening an otherwise subtle thematic close.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, never stated. Concepts of hope, memory, creation, and the power of pattern in a chaotic universe emerge organically from the particulars of the guard, the archive, and the humming charm. The final image of the "stitched together morning" is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what comes after ruin. It resists a simple moral, offering instead a complex, resonant vision of fragile, persistent becoming.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of rediscovering the self through a structured system emerges organically from the central metaphor. However, the resonance is slightly undermined by a moment of thematic over-statement. Discovering the motive written in the notebook ("To rediscover the wild frontier of your mind...") echoes what the gear "seemed to say" too perfectly, functioning as an explicit thesis statement that feels less earned than the story's powerful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with exceptional subtlety and power. The idea that courage is not a destination but a constant companion, a choice to be made, emerges organically from the story's allegorical journey.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of safety's price is woven intricately through recurring motifs of cold, music, silence, and repair. Subtext is handled masterfully in the bellhop's silent communication. The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question. The score is held back slightly because a few lines state the theme too explicitly, such as "when safety is absolute, music must be confiscated," which borders on authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story’s greatest strength, emerging organically from the interplay of character, setting, and object. Concepts of legitimacy, patience, and the nature of truth are explored without a single line of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of finding stability within flux is developed with extraordinary subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the plot, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The final image of lanterns marking not a place but a *timing* is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about loss and memory. The concluding sentence—"nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move"—is a masterstroke, a thesis earned through the preceding narrative rather than one imposed upon it.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding orientation over rage emerges organically from the plot and imagery, particularly the shift from hunting echoes to broadcasting a map. However, the final line—"Meaning, she thought, is simply the courage to ask a machine the right question and wait until it hums back"—is a critical flaw. This Thematic Echo explicitly summarizes the story's thesis, undercutting the powerful resonance of the preceding images and incurring a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of chosen intent versus implanted destiny emerges organically from the story's central conflict and imagery, never resorting to overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of healing, resilience, and the value of human care emerge organically from the story's particulars without overt moralizing. The contrast between the automated lighthouse and the handwritten logbooks is a masterstroke of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic depth is achieved through a central, organizing metaphor—untangling threads to guide the light—that is never heavy-handed. The story explores fragmentation, purpose, and the nature of seeing through concrete imagery and action, avoiding abstraction or moralizing entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of preservation versus communication, silence versus speech, and maintenance as an act of love is woven into the very fabric of the prose.

    Thematic resonance is achieved with masterful subtlety, exploring concepts of listening, memory, and the nature of knowledge without a single line of overt exposition.

The final image of the map spilling back into the tide is a powerful, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire narrative and lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges with subtlety and power from the story's concrete particulars, exploring the tension between observation and intervention, legacy and responsibility. The recurring motif of the pen nib perfectly tracks the protagonist's arc, and its final reinterpretation as "a small spike" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme feels discovered rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)

It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the sand mandala and culminates in the resonant final action of smudging the chalk map. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, although the line about releasing knowledge's "glare, so shadows could instruct" borders on thematic summary. However, its placement as a reflection within the process prevents it from undermining the powerful, image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of restorative justice is handled with profound subtlety and intelligence. The story never preaches; instead, the theme emerges organically from the protagonist’s difficult choices.

It resists a tidy moral, leaving the reader with the complex reality of "a warm coat of frost"—a healing that is necessary but not comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story’s central metaphor of the fractured timeline. Nostalgia, memory, and grief are explored through concrete actions and resonant images rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of gentle, methodical attention as a form of healing emerges organically from the central action. The subtextual interplay between doubt and hope is excellent. However, the score is capped by the on-the-nose thematic statement near the end ("the kindness is a method, and the method is the cure"), which feels like an unnecessary authorial summary in a story that otherwise relies on powerful imagery and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is impeccably integrated, emerging from the concrete particulars of the fossil, the heat map, and the narrator’s actions rather than from abstract statements.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is masterfully handled, emerging organically from the story’s central extended metaphor. The piece explores the nature of wisdom, prophecy, and community memory without a single didactic line. The final images—the open warehouse, the shared pages, the echo becoming a "lantern instead of our judge"—provide a profound, non-literal answer to the initial problem. The final sentence, "the prophecy soften into clay, quick between the fingers of everyone," is a perfect, resonant crystallization of the story's thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding and practicing courage is beautifully woven through the narrative's imagery, particularly the evolution of the pillbox's contents. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated in Len's dialogue ("Unused courage waits where trust has history"), a moment of "thematic echo" that states what the rest of the story so elegantly implies, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is flawlessly integrated through the central conceit of the "palimpsest promise." The action of stitching a new map over old, bled-through letters is a powerful, non-literal exploration of memory and resilience. The final image of the hills transforming from burdens into breathing offers a profound, resonant answer to the story's central question about carrying the past, without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of generative kindness is woven through every image and action, emerging organically from the narrative. The final image of the cups provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final two sentences, particularly "She knew now that...", verge on stating the theme directly. While this crystallizes the potter's earned wisdom, it slightly lessens the impact of the preceding imagery, pulling back from perfect thematic subtlety at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of turning grief into active care emerges organically from the central metaphor of gardening and light. The final image of rooting the beam at home is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the penultimate paragraph ("Protected vulnerability is not a posture but an architecture...") is a direct thematic statement that slightly over-articulates the story's meaning, qualifying as a "Thematic Echo" that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic development is exemplary, emerging organically from image and action. The central question of solitude is explored and resolved with profound nuance, culminating in the line, “The independence I seek is not a door closed, but a door held kindly.” This final sentiment reframes the entire narrative without resorting to moralizing, leaving a powerful, resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is handled with exceptional grace, emerging organically from the story's central images: the thread, the spiral, the water, and the chorus of voices. The narrative finds the "thread that connects all things" not as a stated moral but as a dramatized experience of shared vulnerability. The ending avoids sentimentality, offering a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic resonance is extraordinary, emerging organically from the central conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of empathy as an act of "unifying opposites" is developed with extraordinary subtlety and depth through the story's central action and imagery. However, the final, standalone sentence fragment, "To awaken dormant empathy," is a significant misstep. It functions as an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the profound resonance earned by the preceding scene, reducing a complex emotional resolution to a label. This unnecessary summary is the primary flaw in an otherwise thematically brilliant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic resonance is achieved through brilliantly integrated particulars, not statement. The core theme of stewardship versus control culminates in the exceptional line, "I called it librarianship, which is simply stewardship with better indexes," which re-frames the entire story's action with wit and power, providing a non-literal answer to the story's central questions.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.6)

However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with two overly direct thematic statements in the final third.

The subtextual link between the flower's rot and the village's unbreathed memories is potent and beautifully executed.

    Thematic exploration is the story's greatest triumph. It elegantly develops the idea of resilience not as a fixed quality but as a learned, shared practice. The theme emerges organically through the central metaphors of water flow, echoes, and braided roots, culminating in the final, resonant line: "resilience is not a wall, but a music that gathers, bends, and carries us home." This avoids all didacticism and achieves genuine wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative fabric, emerging organically from the protagonist's actions and precise worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme is potent and developed with masterful subtlety through image and action, resisting simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.4)

    Themes of grief, empathy, and the purpose of art emerge organically from the story’s potent central metaphor. The final image offers a deeply resonant, non-literal answer to the core questions without resorting to a moral. The score is slightly tempered by one moment of direct thematic summary ("Transposed empathy is not charity..."), which, while delivered in-character, verges on over-explanation in an otherwise sublimely subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story masterfully develops its themes of memory, grief, and continuance through resonant images and actions. However, the final two paragraphs venture into direct thematic summary ("I am planting continuance in the clefts of ordinary life"). While eloquently phrased and earned by the preceding scene, this explicit articulation slightly diminishes the power of the subtext, preventing the theme from emerging purely through the story’s potent final images.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of objects as witnesses to emotion emerges organically from the story’s events and imagery. The final image of Mara ready to “carry what she had been trying to drop” provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A minor deduction is applied because the final line of dialogue ("Objects do not forgive or accuse...") comes close to summarizing the theme, slightly diluting the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven into the fabric of the story, emerging organically from the central metaphor of weaving memory. Concepts of connection, sacrifice, and the limits of language are explored through concrete, resonant images rather than assertion.

The line "a map that lies becomes only decoration for ruins" perfectly encapsulates the earned thematic insight without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story’s thematic exploration of safety and community is nuanced and deeply felt, but it falters by occasionally stating its thesis directly. Lines like "Safety is not the absence of loss; it is the ache that shines enough to guide" and "We do this to bottle the feeling of safety" are too explicit, functioning as authorial summary rather than emergent truth. While the final image is resonant, these declarations slightly weaken the subtext by explaining what the imagery already conveys so powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of redefining communication, knowledge, and hope is masterfully woven through the story's central metaphors of light, print, and weather. It resists simple morals, instead offering a complex, resonant vision.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is woven into every image and action, emerging organically from the central metaphor of "iridescent caution." The final image provides a stunning, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The one minor weakness is the line, "I understood then that magnetism was not greed but posture...," which verges on stating the theme directly, slightly lessening the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven through the narrative's central conceits of measured sorrow, witness, and repair. The story explores grief not as an overwhelming flood but as something that can be archived, quantified, and understood. The final realization that "measured grief will float if you let it" is earned through the protagonist's specific actions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial problem without resorting to moralizing. The phrase "mundane miracles... arrive with schedules and clipboards" brilliantly encapsulates the story’s thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of integration—of self, community, and opposing forces like light and dark—is developed with exceptional subtlety and power. The central concept of "bound release" is perfectly reprised at the end, providing a non-literal answer to the story's problem.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's central conceit, the "Order of Nestled Paradoxes."

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the story's central images and actions, particularly the handling of the bread.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s concrete particulars, culminating in a resonant final insight that is earned, not stated. The entire narrative functions on subtext, with unspoken threats and allegiances playing out in glances and gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic concerns of belief versus doubt, and of humanity's relationship with a living world, emerge with immense grace from the story's concrete particulars.

The subtext of consensus and communication ("quorum," "unfinished debates") is masterfully woven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.7)

    The theme of "candor in small moments" is explored with remarkable depth and nuance, evolving from a personal principle to a communal foundation for survival. The story resists a simple moral, presenting the postmaster's deception as a form of misguided mercy, which makes the final resolution more complex and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.7)

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of containing chaos through care, rather than seeking to eliminate it, emerges organically from the plot. The central metaphor of the child's tin of fears is beautifully deployed, transforming from a simple keepsake into a profound tool for understanding survival. The score is capped below the 9-band due to a "thematic echo" in the final paragraphs; lines like "That is how you survive a world that moves under you" state the theme with a directness that slightly lessens the power of the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story brilliantly embodies its theme of collective healing through listening, with the resolution serving as a powerful, dramatized proof. The final image of the changed developer is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph lapses into a direct thematic statement with "our proof is simple: we heal in the hearing," which slightly undermines the otherwise perfect subtlety. This explicit moralizing, while in-voice, prevents the theme from landing entirely through subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of resistance through subversive art is powerfully and originally rendered. The story avoids direct moralizing, instead embedding its ideas—encrypting vulnerability as strength, creating new grammars of survival—into the core mechanics of the plot. The final image of a knot becoming a bow is a stunning, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, offering a resonant sense of release rather than simple triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of how memory persists and how we find paths through loss is developed with extraordinary subtlety and potent imagery. The final sentence ("It keeps a path through change...") borders on a thematic statement, but it is framed as a personal, earned epiphany that lands with resonance rather than didacticism. The entire narrative functions as a complex, non-literal answer to the problem of grief, resisting easy morals.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from a cascade of potent images rather than statement. The central question of how to confront a destructive future is answered not with force, but with listening, patience, and the "mapping of silence." The final line—"In such teachings, prophecies learn to be quiet, and hearts learn to stay"—is a resonant, non-literal conclusion that reweights the entire piece with profound insight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's magnificent core, emerging organically from the central metaphor of buildings as linguistic structures.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming isolation is beautifully developed through the central metaphor of archiving weather. The final images are resonant and resist a simple moral. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext in the concluding paragraphs with lines like "It showed me how to translate isolation into independence," which restates the premise too explicitly and borders on thematic summary where embodiment alone would have been more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging with profound subtlety from the central metaphor of calligraphy. Concepts of mercy, justice, and forgiveness are explored through concrete actions like "unlinking the line before it tightens into law." The final image of the blank margin is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resisting a simple moral in favor of resonant complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of connection through obligation ("debt") is developed with stunning originality through the central metaphor of echoes. The story's final image of the braided voices offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the line "So that is why some people echo, I say..." is a moment of thematic over-statement that slightly undermines the otherwise perfect subtext, momentarily replacing resonance with declaration just before the close.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is elegantly woven into the narrative, emerging from character action and resonant imagery. The line "exposure is a gentle blade when you want the wound to heal" borders on being a direct statement, but the story earns it by fully dramatizing this philosophy. The final, quiet scene delivers the thematic payoff with sublime understatement, avoiding a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of appreciating hidden, patient effort emerges organically from a masterfully controlled set of recurring images: mending, weaving, whisking, and observing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of truth versus comfortable lies emerges organically from the plot and is powerfully embodied in the final choice to keep the love note.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's dense, specific imagery, exploring faith, science, and community without a single didactic line. The central concept of allegiance is examined through action and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The final image of allegiance unfolding "like a kite's spine, locking ribs against the old wind" brilliantly reweights all prior events and fulfills the 9+ standard.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven through the central metaphor of jarring sounds, emerging organically from character and action. The final image of the music box as a "lighthouse for the quiet" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions about memory and connection. A slight deduction is for the line "In that answering I gleaned redemption," which verges on being too explicit a thematic statement in an otherwise beautifully subtle narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of resolving conflict through empathetic alignment rather than force emerges organically from the plot and is beautifully rendered in the final image. The story resists a simple moral, embracing complexity. However, it is weakened by moments of thematic summary, particularly the line, "logic and emotion both prefer good data, and sorrow is the truest data," which reads as an authorial thesis statement rather than an earned character insight.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of "a patient revolution" is developed with great conceptual clarity and resonant imagery. The story successfully translates an abstract idea into concrete action and a powerful closing scene. However, the theme is occasionally stated too directly, as in the line "not a storm but a school, not a blade but a shaping." While delivered as instruction, this moment verges on thematic summary, slightly reducing the subtext and preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of collective responsibility versus systemic failure emerges organically from the story's particulars. The lantern as a symbol of shared risk and hope is potent without being heavy-handed. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about memory and duty. A minor deduction is warranted for the line "risk becomes safety only when communities share it," which borders on stating the theme directly, a slight thematic echo in an otherwise masterful display of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's absolute core, emerging organically from every image and exchange without a single instance of didacticism. Concepts of repair, time, guilt, and grace are explored with profound depth, culminating in a final image that offers a complex, non-literal answer to the central problem.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety and power from the story's particulars. Concepts of faith, creation, and the nature of desire are explored through concrete images like the repurposed arrow tip and the kaleidoscope, never through direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory versus erasure is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the plot. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the central metaphor of "where deleted files go" to ask profound questions about grief, community, and digital existence. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer: the silence, once an absence, "answered like surf," suggesting that memory, once surfaced, can become a powerful, living force. The synthesis of the spaceship disaster grief with Aida's digital hiding is an elegant and powerful thematic link.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of peace as an ongoing practice rather than a singular judgment is developed with exceptional grace and power. It emerges organically from the narrator's actions and the story's central metaphors—reconstituting a whole from fragments, compost from guilt. The final two sentences are a thematic masterstroke, reframing the "courageous anomaly" into "practice" as the mechanism by which peace is kept. This provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of learning to face endings without surrendering to them is developed with immense grace and subtlety. It emerges organically from the narrator's actions—listening to the ice, rescuing the child, talking with Erland. While Erland’s dialogue verges on being a direct thematic statement ("vanishing teaches little unless you learn its preface first"), it functions as earned wisdom within the narrative's lyrical frame. The final image of tracing the "margin of mercy" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of reconciling differences emerges beautifully from the central vine-grafting metaphor. However, the story falters with a direct thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph: "We keep this place for those who seek to nurture intersubjective understanding..." This "thematic echo" replaces earned resonance with overt summary, a significant flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme is developed with exceptional grace, contrasting the "blare" of prophecy with the enduring "echo" of wisdom. It emerges organically from the central conceit and the physical actions of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of transmuting pain into a shared, walkable masterpiece is developed with immense grace and subtlety. The story relies on powerful central images—the map case, the mirror, the corridor—to carry thematic weight, avoiding moralizing. The narrator’s statement of intent ("our aim is to transmute pain into a masterpiece") feels earned as a methodological principle within the scene rather than an authorial intrusion. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about healing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration is the story's great strength, emerging organically from image and action rather than statement. The final realization that "to decode the pattern of growth is to forgive how slowly it reveals itself" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about language and endings. The story avoids easy morals, instead building a complex, moving argument for tending, listening, and accepting ambiguity, which lingers long after reading.

The story's central question is resolved with a beautiful, complex ambiguity that lingers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's resonant core, emerging organically from the conflict between two ways of knowing—patience versus certainty, signal versus noise. Metaphors like "instruments confess in their own dialects" are not decorative but are the thematic argument in miniature. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resolving not with a moral but with a profound reorientation of purpose: "our work was to answer."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.7)

The central theme—turning mistakes into constellations to guide toward mercy—emerges organically from the core metaphors of bone-setting and mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.4)

    The theme—that hope is an engineered system requiring maintenance—emerges organically from the protagonist’s actions, never feeling imposed.

It emerges organically from the central conflict and is crystallized in resonant images like the maps with "extra banks." The final image of "ripples like new lines on a map" provides a perfect, non-didactic answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the line "Hindsight clarity arrived not as a knife but as a tide," which, while poetic, borders on explaining the thematic epiphany rather than purely dramatizing it.

However, the piece is marred by moments of thematic echo, where the narrator explicitly states the theme in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of kindness as a resilient, unspoken language is powerfully developed through image and action. However, the line "just the old grammar of decency, a dialect many misplace but never entirely lose" is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext. While the stunning final image recovers the resonance, this moment of telling instead of showing prevents a higher score.
