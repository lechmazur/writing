    Theme emerges through the juxtaposition of neutron star decay and butterfly dust erosion—both following "the same patient arithmetic" of gradual change crossing thresholds. The recurring dust motif constrains choices (what to collect, how to measure) and charges the ending's "both equally" comparison.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chrysalis metaphor perfectly reweights the entire piece - the station, herself, and the moth-bats all exist in "subdued awakenings," refusing full emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong thematic coherence around cyclical time, self-confrontation, and the weight of choices across iterations. The "minotaur at its heart" revelation elegantly reframes the journey.

The final image ("carrying her and her flickering faith into the widening yes") provides a conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and is crystallized in the stunning line: “Empathy, he realized, isn’t kindness; it’s consent to fracture.” The final image of the lake as a circuit and the time loop’s closure offer a profound, non-literal answer to the cost of redemption without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the specific, concrete particulars of the ritual and the sisters' bond. The concept that "love can be both furnace and forge" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss and renewal, earned entirely through the narrative's action and imagery. It resists tidy moralizing, embracing profound complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of grief and lost time is woven entirely through concrete image and action, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "lost time accumulates wherever love refuses to end, and that every fracture is only a doorway shaped like a question mark."

The final line's echo avoids thematic echo penalty by being dramatized as a voice within the constellation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges flawlessly from the central action of photographic development, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "we become weather."

== Grader: GPT-5 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of gradual change and anti-melodrama emerges through particulars (diffraction scales, maintenance lapse, adaptive thickening) and culminates in the “two containers of decay.” A couple of thesis-forward lines (“No villains, only vectors”) risk mild didacticism, but the closing image reweights without tidy moralizing. Resonance lingers as conceptual, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of pause, purpose, and non‑erasure arise through recurrent objects (ledger, frost, beads, obsidian) and culminate in a non‑literal answer: step off the path, host quiet dawn hours. The final image reweights earlier material without moralizing. A few explicit statements (“discover purpose in the pauses”) brush the edge of telling but are largely earned by scene work. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—silence as translation, not absence—emerges from concrete acts and images (heat-mapped instruments, thawing “perfect fifths”). Subtext in audience silhouettes and the treble-clef breath is resonant. One explicit thesis line (“she understood then…”) edges toward stating the moral, slightly reducing subtlety. The finale reweights prior images without neat moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of custodianship, memorial labor, and the “address of rest” emerge from image and action rather than argument. The lens/librarians motif reframes death work as curation with social cost and responsibility. A faint whiff of thesis appears in the sentence “to remind the living that rest has a permanent address,” but the preceding beats have earned it. The final image reweights earlier material with lingering ambiguity and tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Resonant motifs (bell, tiles, bread, saffron) accrue a compelling theme of communion over smuggling and investment in future voices. The reframing of donations as “investment” effectively reweights prior beats, and the bell becoming archive marries body and memory. Occasional declaratives (“We are not waiting…”) skim toward thesis, but subtext mostly carries meaning. The truncated final moment deprives the theme of its closing reverberation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from enactment: breath reciprocity as love’s duty; unused love returns as river water to the river. Subtext thrums in images (lantern-flowers, mothing petals around the man’s heart) and a charged object economy (tear, silk). The line “storage is not a place but a posture” risks thesis-stating but is earned by the mechanics and cost just shown. The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of release/planting time rather than seizing it emerges through concrete beats (crushing the fragment, seed, the photo sharpening after letting go). Subtext rides image and sensation more than statement; one line (“false continuity of self”) edges toward explicit thesis but doesn’t flatten the resonance. The final cadence reweights prior images without moralizing. It lingers with a complex acceptance rather than a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme coheres (liberation vs. what follows; resilience as true victory) and images earn resonance (arrow/banner; seeds in cracked soil). However, the explicit moral line “liberation is only the first prize; the real victory is what you plant afterward” undercuts subtext near the end. Much else works by implication and image, so the overt statement slightly blunts the afterglow. Still, the final cadence carries a meaningful reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of absence, betrayal, memory, and the ethics of listening emerge from particulars (absences as dew, roots feeding on stories) and culminate in a non‑literal answer: tune devices to reveal the hush where trust trembles. Subtext hums through image (trees tasting wounds, petals chiming) and resists platitude. One sentence edges toward didactic (“collecting absences had never been about fixing the past”), slightly on‑the‑nose but still earned by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of memory, forgiveness, and the ethics of curation emerge organically via action (stealing, projecting, reassembling) rather than assertion. Recurring images (moonbeams, marigolds, coordinates) accrue meaning; the final “destiny breathing back” reweights the premise. “Destiny’s door swings both ways” risks explicitness but is earned by the prior particulars and lands as a compressed thesis. Emotional aftereffect lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: repurposing as redemption, inquiry needing protection, thaw as grief’s recalibration. Recurring images (bookmark, tape, melt, narration) accrue meaning and reweight at the end. The line “safe zones belong wherever they are needed” risks slight directness but is earned by the scene’s particulars. The final invitation (“Enter, wonder, argue, forgive”) resonates without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of “betraying the frame” and vulnerability as power emerge through concrete acts (keeping the trembling take, projecting rehearsal footage), not just assertion. However, the final sentence edges into overt thesis language (“Vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source”), dulling subtext. The shell as motif elegantly reframes voice and inheritance. The piece still invites reflection on authorship and exploitation without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of stewardship, memory, and the ethics of naming arise from concrete acts (mapping via silence) rather than pronouncements. The “ambered hush” evolves from atmosphere to ethic and finally to a charged cosmology. The ending reweights the whole: darkness becomes navigable community (“peopled with listening”) at a cost. No sermonizing; resonance lingers through images (afterimage on gold leaf) and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of emergence through repetition and friction are strong and organically tethered to the loop and instrument. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“thoughts came from the friction…,” “not answers, but the infinite possibility…”), trimming subtext. The final image supports resonance, but the explicitness dampens afterglow. Even so, the motif work (violin, mop, timed chimes) carries genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of secrecy, honesty, and communal memory emerge through concrete acts (silent film in lieu of confession) rather than declarations. The open‑lock doodle reweights earlier symbols without moralizing. Ambiguity remains (pranksters’ ethics vs. collective healing), granting the ending a humane complexity. It’s a touch tidy, but subtext carries the apology.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of service vs control, luck vs attunement, and value in brokenness emerge organically through action and image. The marbles’ “constellation” and the glove reweight prior symbols effectively. A few lines verge on thesis-stating (“The truth was more beautiful”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through images (chrysalis, lattice of choices, icy warmth) rather than moralizing, culminating in a resonant refusal that redefines “proof.” The sideways‑time doorway vs. equation reframes her quest without evasiveness. Recurrences (nexus pulse, wings at rest) return reweighted at the end. One overt metaphor (“the station was such a chrysalis”) is earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    Thematic weave (silence between notes, flooded liminality, unsung voices) is organic and reprises in the ending. However, several explicit statements (“real art lived,” “permission to exist in those between-spaces”) edge into moralizing and dull subtext in the final third. The images themselves carry the theme well when allowed. Resonance lingers, though more could be trusted to implication.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme arises organically: truth as weight, protection as complicit prophecy, and the ethics of forgetting vs. bearing. Recurring images (laurel, instruments, aurora, smudge) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final ledger line (“4.7 grams of sorrow, valley temporarily innocent”) provides a resonant, non-literal answer that charges innocence as cyclical and costly. Ambiguity lingers cleanly: protection is temporary, cost persists.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of industrial sin, faith vs. empiricism, and the commodification of truth emerge through concrete acts (radio divination as “science,” the ledger’s “Net weight of truth,” bead-rosary imagery). The final repricing—truth as mass transferred—reweights all prior images without moralizing. Subtext in the ghosts’ open mouths and bead-offerings is potent and unsaid. Resonance lingers in the heartbeat-code motif.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of witness, memory, and mercy cohere through recurring images (swan, silence, ink, sand). The final repricing—loosening grip as mercy, not decay—reweights the whole. Occasional direct restatement of the oath flirts with over-explicitness, but subtext largely carries the load. The last charged image of becoming “another stone” resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—preserving wonder against numbing certainty—emerges through concrete acts and images, not moralizing. The choice to let the note fray rather than instruct becomes the thematic stance. Recurring particulars (curl, stone, eclipse hush) reweight at the end, inviting reflection without tidy assurance. The piece avoids sermonizing even when naming “ordinary magic.”

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory as architecture, the ethics of preservation vs. transformation, and choosing to become what one seeks are woven through particulars. Recurring images (bronze quiet, axis, dragons) reprice at the end without moralizing. The final cadence offers a resonant answer: making oneself the displaced axis to let places carry stories. Ambiguity remains purposeful and invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—open secrets, prophecy becoming true by being carried, light’s confession vs. the sea’s loud secrecy—emerges from particulars, not thesis statements. The final image conceptually reprices the premise (he becomes tuned by the island he leaves). Dialogue carries subtext (keeper: “Ever think the light talks?”). No moralizing; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—faith as door vs. wall, doubt as method and color—emerges from actions (negative space cross, hum of assumption) rather than exposition. The woman’s line risks being thesis‑like but is earned by the preceding images and recasts the blue motif. The final repricing (answers deprive possession) resonates beyond the scene without moralizing. Recurrences (heartbeat, silence, ultramarine) shift meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—memory as home, time reversed/etched, unheard symphonies—emerges from particulars (cookies, factory basement, mirrored horizon) and reweights at the end (“you are already home”). Subtext hums in the postal loops of fortunes and the ocean keeping songs the earth refused, without moralizing. The final repricing—the map is the home—answers the opening ache with resonance, not thesis. Ambiguity remains purposeful (the future child inheriting the dawn-song).

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of identity as a maze of choices is embodied through the tablet, the minotaur metaphor, and the elder self. Recurring images (“between the drop and the ripple”) reweight meaning at closure without moralizing. The elder’s line edges close to thesis‑statement but is redeemed by the action that follows and the charged final doorway. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of silence transformed into lived feeling emerges organically through action, not moralizing; subtext lives in touch and craft. Recurring images (needle/filament, hush, vibration) reweight at the end. One line (“numbness is only silence waiting…”) edges toward thesis‑statement but is largely earned by prior particulars. The final image resists tidy moral and settles into charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of truth vs. censorship and solitude as ethical stance emerge organically from action (rogue zone, pigeons as lateral chain). The final image—tasting unrecorded rain—reweights the premise without didacticism. One line edges toward thesis statement (“truth… finds its own velocity”) but is earned by the preceding metaphoric system. Subtext in “quarantine” reframed as suppression of truth is potent and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: scent as time travel, grief as cultivation, and forgiveness as a distilled compound. One thematic line risks explicitness (“every tear…is a refusal…”) but it’s metabolized by the scene’s sensory logic. The ending offers a non-literal answer via image rather than sermon. Resonance lingers without tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars (rope as time’s texture; Mrs. Chen’s garden; Marcus’s fingerprints). The final image reweights earlier motifs without stating a moral, offering a resonant answer: choosing the ongoing weight of choice over dissolution. A few abstract lines flirt with telling, but the imagery keeps subtext primary. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of unfinishedness as invitation, inheritance vs. reinvention, and survival transformed into generativity emerge through image and action, not sermon. The line “beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation” edges toward explicitness but is grounded by surrounding scene work. The final image reweights prior motifs (bowl, bell, ash, dawn) with lingering resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful and rich rather than murky.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises from particulars: commodified feelings, half‑truths, and the insufficiency of insight without empathy. The ending reweights earlier material without sermonizing; “They had fused her” offers a resonant answer. A couple of explicit lines nudge toward statement but are buffered by strong images (bruise‑bloom, cracked vial). Subtext in the chemist’s “You’ll feel what they felt. But not why.” deepens the ethical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of cyclical generosity and custodial stewardship are woven through recurring images (ledger, locket, lantern, receipt) and reweighted at the end. Subtext in anonymity and bureaucratic compassion reads cleanly. However, a few end‑paragraph lines edge into overt moral statement (“compassion, like cargo, is only ever on loan”), dulling the otherwise earned resonance. The piece could trust its images a shade more.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of community as enacted practice, not discovered artifact, emerges through particulars: weaving reeds, listening, shared dawns, Emil’s silent cession. The final image reweights everything—the “tag” becomes a ritual of seeing together—and avoids moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (offering the reveal, seed silhouettes), not pronouncements. The resonance lingers as a lived ethic of care and mutual inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Memory, debt, and the ethics of release are dramatized rather than stated, with the pendant’s shift (∞ → Möbius → sealed loop) reweighting meaning. The recovered syllable completes an interrupted cadence, linking form and theme without moralizing. The ending’s “debts are paid by choosing which memories to set free” resonates as earned insight. Ambiguity lingers around what future she forfeited, enriching the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of ambiguous loss and “solving for motion” emerges organically from action, not sermon. Recurring objects (eyes, mosaic, drip) accrue meaning and culminate in a conceptual repricing: emotion shifts from number to locus, and grief finds a limit rather than a solution. The final optimism is honest, not pat, preserving cost. A single explicit statement (“Emotion is not a number…”) borders on told insight but aligns with the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of stories as survival/lanterns emerges through action and the recurrent fragments, culminating in communal voice. The taped line “Stories are lanterns” toes the edge of explicitness but is diegetically justified and earned by prior particulars. Subtext operates in gestures (her hand on the boards) and the charged hush. Resonance lingers without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of mastery vs. relationship is woven through recurring images (veins, storm, trellis, controlled systems) and culminates in the reconstructed humanity. Subtext hums via plant “language” and the assistant’s quiet acceptance. A couple lines near the end state the thesis a shade directly, slightly thinning the mystery. Still, the final image reweights knowledge as surrender without neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme braids memory, ecology, and art as exchange; images do the work (amber, spirals, drowned frescoes) with strong subtext around what water “remembers.” The ending reweights the premise: vigilance as gift, exchange as meaning rather than goods. A touch of stated thesis (“This is the real exchange”) leans didactic, but the surrounding imagery keeps it from tipping into sermon. Resonance persists via the island existing in “multiple times.”

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance is strong—attention as magic, cost of sight, carrying wonder into the mundane. However, the near-moralizing line “clairvoyance is not seeing everything...” states the thesis overtly in the final stretch, dulling subtext. Earlier images (bright darkness, unseen forces, children’s play turning cosmic) earn much of the thematic weight. The ending’s conceptual repricing still lingers despite the explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Absence, fragments, and reconstitution accrue into a resonant answer: communal heartening requires recombining dispossessed parts at personal cost. Recurring images (valve, staggered intervals, outlawed language) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The promise to “compile the echo” reframes archiving as an ethical act, not mere record‑keeping. Ambiguity remains humane rather than foggy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of self-erasure, authorship of one’s life, and the price of precision over presence emerge organically from object use and setting metamorphosis. Recurring images (arrows, punch, mist/vault) reweight meaning at the end without didacticism. One line—“Speak or be spoken for”—skirts overt thesis, but it’s dramatized by the boarding dare and paid off in the final canvas. The emotional aftereffect lingers through the arrival vs. escape reframe.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically: knowledge as participation and compassion, grief as communal memory, the ethics of relinquishing proof for connection. The whale answer reweights earlier motifs (unheard symphony, migration of attention) without stating a thesis. The final acts (pocketing the score in her mother’s notebook, seeding the tile for another) create a conceptual repricing with lingering ambiguity. Sentiment is earned through concrete particulars, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around exile, farewell, and reorienting compulsion—space mutiny reframed as temporal and existential departure. Recurring images (“hush,” “goodbye,” magnetic pull) accrue meaning and reprice at the end without moralizing. The final choice answers “What happens after goodbye?” with resonant ambiguity and cost. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through act and image: the ethics of exchange, bureaucracy versus human life, legacy inverted. The “mathematics” of a fair trade is dramatized, not preached, and the final absence (lost lullaby) gives a resonant, non‑literal answer. The ink’s liquefaction metaphor extends to policy and conscience without strain. No false equivalence: Rurik is implicated without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of history as curated desire emerges organically via forgeries becoming real and silence as “a library of moments.” Slight deduct for explicit thesising—“history is a bonsai, pruned by desire”—which edges into stated moral in the penultimate beat. Nonetheless, the ending reweights prior images with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of bureaucratic annihilation, memory as material, and identity as collage emerge via objects and acts rather than thesis lines. Recurring motifs (label, tide, echoing containers) shift meaning at the end from threat to chosen armor. No moralizing; ambiguity persists (poison “loyalty” vs. reassembled self). The final cadence offers a resonant answer: survival through ethically fraught accretion.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—retold voices, porous truth, three universal sounds—culminating in the insight that sameness exists in listeners’ insistence on difference. The seashell/compass/cello triad refracts belief vs. measurement with emotional honesty. One line states the thesis rather directly (“He understood now...”), shaving a touch of mystery. Overall, the final image reweights prior material with lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of ownership, survival through transformation, and the ethics of “loving without owning” surface through events and images, not sermonizing. The dual allegiance refracts each choice, culminating in a final image that says “we are still becoming” without tidy moral. Subtext in the grotesque mask tactic and rice‑paper poems deepens the critique of branding and erasure. No thematic overstatement; complexity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Witnessing versus forgetting develops through concrete particulars (hourglass grain, abandoned Tycho, extinct anemones) rather than lecture. The late reprise (curiosity as mourning; “only color left of them”) reweights earlier images without a pat moral. One explicit thought (“curiosity…another form of mourning”) comes close to telling, but it’s earned and anchored in action. The final image leaves a durable conceptual repricing of time and attention.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of translating fear into function and “decoding feedback into direction” are dramatized, not stated. Lira’s blindness and recovery mirror the drone’s relearning, giving the final arc a resonant repricing of terror as torque. Recurring images (light, spectra, water) evolve meaningfully. No moralizing undercuts the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of origins, language as creation, and knowledge’s institutional erasure accrues through particulars—the phrasebook, labeled streams, microorganisms spelling words—without sermonizing. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: origins converge when witnessed and released, not captured, with a conceptual and social price. Recurrences (spiral, river-words, map as projection) are reweighted at closure. The Helsinki/Quechua coda widens resonance without flattening ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of restoration, communal memory, and sacrifice emerge from particulars (footsteps as memory, bellflowers from fork sand) rather than thesis. The final image is a resonant answer: balance requires personal forfeiture and communal readiness (waiting for “the first living foot”). Ambiguity lingers productively about ownership and cost. No moralizing undercuts the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme develops organically: memory vs. oblivion, solitude into signal, maps as love’s proxy. The lilac vial’s transformation into frequency reframes “ephemeral” as durable communion, answering the central question without moralizing. Subtext hums in images (temple adopting her past as liturgy) and the ending reweights prior material with lingering ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of confession, inheritance, silence versus voice, and redemption arise organically through objects and acts (lattice, pipe, hush). The hush becomes music—silence transfigured rather than denied—offering a resonant non‑literal answer. No sermonizing; insight is earned via the labyrinth’s rules and the father’s memory. Ambiguity lingers productively in what the new path entails and what costs persist.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mercy as poison, forgiveness across lifetimes, and the ethics of care culminate in “a mercy that looked like murder.” The bead’s “resonant awakenings” reweight the past and present without thesis‑telling. Final images—the bead sinking, the orchard’s spring failure—offer a resonant answer to the debt question. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of repair, precedent, and reverence emerge through action (weaving, blood, dissolution) rather than thesis. Recurring orchids reprice meaning from funerary sweetness to regenerative power at closure. One sentence edges toward moralizing proof (“proof that broken precedents…”), slightly on‑the‑nose, but the imagery carries the weight. The ending lingers with earned ambiguity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of restitution, diaspora return, and colonial desecration emerge through particulars and ritual rather than argument. “Interrupted journeys” refracts through mirrors and ancestor‑roots, then reweights in the final receiving of travelers. The ending’s breath‑not‑thunder returns faith without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Identity, authorship, and the ethics of concealment emerge through objects and acts (mailing, chalk, barcodes vs daisies) rather than thesis. The final choice reweights “meaning in the margins” via action. One sentence (“she understood that meaning lived…”) edges toward a stated theme, slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: listening as power, wisdom disguised as foolishness, and names as cultural sovereignty. Recurring images (candle, silence, stitching) reweight at the end without moralizing; the culture‑vs‑junta renaming beat concretizes stakes. The lullaby reversal embodies subtext (children’s nonsense decoding death lists). The final quiet dawn reframes victory as charged stasis rather than triumphalism.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of apology, decision, and return surface through objects and actions rather than abstractions. Recurring images (shard, condensation, moonlight) reprice meaning at the end without moralizing. The “come back whole” motif bridges past/future via subtext. The ending lantern of “salt and song” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of translation, culpability, and communal memory arise through particulars (reef/spiral/fish) rather than lecture. The closing reprices trauma—from shrapnel to sediment—without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer: meaning is remade through shared naming. Subtext operates via image alignment (coral on cast) and the discharge note’s metaphor. A single explanatory sentence (“not inventory but confession”) skirts explicitness but is earned by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motifs (film/exposure/light vs. shadow) evolve into earned insight, and the final image reweights prior material without needing explication. However, the line “She realized joy had never been lost; it had merely waited to be developed” states the thesis a touch directly, softening subtext’s charge. Still, the mural’s ongoing projection and travelers’ rumor create lingering, multi‑valent resonance. Emotional honesty avoids false neatness; the cost of carrying light remains.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of curiosity over certainty emerges through actions and objects (coin as “city’s coinage of attention,” inverted waves draining into possibility). The ending reweights prior images without heavy explanation. Slight ding for the overt thesis line in dialogue, though it’s contextually earned. Subtext in the guide’s reply and lullaby of “verbs without endings” lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of state capture of imagination and counter‑speech through living language arise from concrete acts (planting a glyph as resistance). Subtext in coded botany, tax forms (1099‑IDEA), and bees carrying “subversive pollen” builds resonance without sermonizing. The final image reprices the premise—language as flora, freedom as horticulture. One phrase (“untaxed thought unfurl”) edges toward explicitness but remains image‑led.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of intergenerational care, art as armistice, and transforming grief into beauty emerge from particulars (cherry pits instead of bullets; dew planetarium; self‑multiplying voice). The final act reframes the premise as communal stewardship, not heroics, achieving conceptual repricing. No moralizing; resonance lingers with the image of petals landing on future battlefields. Ambiguity is purposeful yet clear.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story interrogates preservation’s cruelty: saving communal memory by consuming the caretaker’s self, culminating in a resonant repricing when her name becomes music for the living. Motifs (names, bulbs, foxglove, tube) accrue meaning and reweight at the end without moralizing. The museum’s “deserted marvels” reflect the cost/benefit tension with credible ambiguity. The after‑image (child and note) extends theme without explanatory gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of which silences merit breaking is earned through concrete acts (promises as harmonics; weapon → bridge). Family voices returning reframes language as trust, not power, delivering a resonant non‑literal answer. One line edges toward statement (“not document extinction but resurrection”) but the images do the heavy lift. Subtext hums via the negative space reveal and the cost of becoming the last note.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Encrypted compassion” is not mere rhetoric; it’s enacted by decoding data into an ethic of shared risk and benefit. Recurring images (chain as boundary/bridge; breath as regulation) reweight meaning at the end. The piece resists moralizing, letting the duet and the quivering gate answer the question. Slight neatness in the 70/30 ratio brushes the edge of tidy but stays grounded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Identity as migratory music and paper trails reweighted into air: the final children’s humming and dust‑chord earn a non‑literal answer. Recurring images (skylight, birds, sheet music) accrue meaning without moralizing. The mother’s erased lullaby returns with cost and grace. Complexity lingers: preservation requires erasure of the self.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motifs (wood grain, weather code, thresholds, drift) interlock to articulate “necessary distances” with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. One line explicitly states the thesis, slightly dulling subtext, but most meaning arises from image and action. The final reprise (maze dissolves; terrace continues west) reweights the premise with earned poignancy. Complexity remains without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of belonging as reciprocal recognition emerges through concrete rites, not assertion. Recurring images (feathers, breath, constellations, bubbles) shift meaning at the end, revaluing science as ceremony. The final promise reframes “captivate” ethically without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively (what the city wants; the cost of remembering vs. recording).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece resonates on transformation/erosion vs. renewal, with a strong image system (foam, seeds, glass, dawn) carrying subtext. The final emotional cascade answers the central question without needing exposition. However, the explicit sand message (“Every path disappears…”) veers into moralizing and reduces the lingering ambiguity. Despite that, the afterimage remains moving and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—control versus wildness, authorship versus wonder—emerges through particulars, not pronouncements. “Orchestrated serendipity” is tested and then revalued by the final surrender to the tide. The quiet aftereffect (private encore) resists tidy moralizing. A hair more friction or consequence would deepen the resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: body as archive against state erasure, exile redefined as interior vacancy that must be refilled. Recurring images (tide, anchoring, moonstone, gaps) shift meaning at the end, offering a non‑literal answer: she embodies the memory the world bans. No moralizing; resonance rests in concrete images and conceptual cost. The closing walk toward a long‑waiting horizon carries earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of valuing the mundane and reparation accrue through specific relics (teacup, harmonica, scar) and reweight at the end when ordinary windows are redeemed. Subtext works through ritualized speech and image rather than thesis. “She understood the assignment” edges toward meta-plainness but is buffered by scene pressure. The last image’s code of rings sustains resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme coheres through recurring images (ash, scar, light, language) and culminates in a non‑literal but felt answer: pain becomes communicable form. Subtext runs through the ritual rather than sermon; “commissioned” risks neatness but is earned by prior acts. The final sprout adds a resonant counter‑voice without tidy absolution. The “bargain” motif is repriced rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece integrates hope, observation, and agency through recurrent images; the closing sentence in shells reweights the observer/observed dynamic without collapsing into sermon. The “equation” motif risks abstraction but is earned by concrete ritual and reciprocal Miras. Resonance lingers in the charged poise of resetting to “unknown.” Slight didactic tint in the explicit shell‑spelled line prevents a top‑tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    “Legacy’s burden” evolves from motif to operative law, reweighted by the camera‑building reveal and the final absorption. The piece resists moralizing, letting images (reversed laughter, child‑frame scream) carry meaning. The ending provides a resonant, non‑literal answer: to learn what walls dream, one risks becoming their negative space. Thematic coherence is tight and lingers beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of truth vs illusion, communal belief, and transformation emerge through concrete acts (coded lullabies, borrowed heartbeat, becoming a mirror). The final image reweights earlier motifs—reflection beats creation, and persuasion begins with vulnerability. One line edges into thesis (“persuasion wasn't about forcing change but about reflecting potential”), slightly on‑the‑nose. Subtext otherwise carries its weight via image and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Recurring images (clipboard, terrace, celestial dance) build to a thematic answer: peace as flawed endurance, redemption as ongoing cost. Some thematic lines verge on direct statement (“the price of redemption,” “not victors or vanquished”), edging toward sermonizing. However, the final reweighting through action (signing) and image (terrace exhale) sustains resonance. Complexity is embraced without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as violence, philanthropy as self‑myth, extinction’s echo as the only immortality. The final images reweight the premise without moralizing—ghosts sink into salt, the egg becomes “fossil of sound,” mines continue. Ambiguity is meaningful (reverence vs. complicity) and resists platitude. The resonance lingers beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory, autonomy, conformity, and self‑definition emerge organically from action and image, not thesis statements. The final reweighting—freedom as a “terrifying lullaby”—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that complicates victory. Recurring motifs (echoes, mercury tears, “between sigh and smile”) accrue and transform at the end. No sermonizing; the piece trusts implication.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance is strong through recurring images (smoke, puppets, ash, dome) that reweight meaning at the end. However, lines like “ethical storytelling wasn’t about choosing sides” and the manifesto sentence edge into thesis-stating, diluting subtext. Still, the final doorways/ashes image carries honest ambiguity. The theme largely arises from action rather than lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of honoring overlooked histories via temporary permanence is woven through recurring objects (wire, wing, cloud-soil) and culminates in a resonant final image. The grandmother’s maxim and the closing reflections edge toward explicitness, slightly reducing subtext. Still, the reweighting—stories gain weight by dissolving rather than being preserved—is conceptually strong and earned by scene. The butterfly’s cadence moving from interrupted to whole neatly enacts the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: memory as vibration versus object, forgiveness as access to preservation, craft transmuted into stewardship. Recurring images (bells, rope, aurora, melting) culminate in a reweighted ethic of carrying rather than owning. One line (“preservation is not a bronze bell...”) edges toward thesis, but it’s earned by concrete particulars. The ending’s river‑borne names deliver lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—continuity vs. decay as ordered letting‑go—emerges through object/action patterning (seal, directive, storm, dream method) and culminates in a resonant reweighting. Subtext works in images (being “walked” by the path; the bunker becoming seed). One line states the thesis overtly (“walkers and paths are one another’s becoming”), nudging toward explicitness. Even so, the final images carry the meaning without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: number vs. ritual, devotion encoded rather than declared, knowledge safeguarded by renunciation. Recurring images (dust as constellations, lapis, the square) deepen meaning and reweight at the end. The “encrypted devotion” motif crystallizes when his marginal notes return as prophecy. No moralizing; the piece sustains ambiguity about power and secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of release versus resentment is earned through specific somatic memories and the object’s failure, not summaries. The “teaching peace” thesis risks abstraction once (“calculus of vengeance…zero”) but the images re-anchor it. The ending reweights the premise: the lesson resides in turning a damaged wheel, not producing sound. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of boundaries, form vs possibility, and the ethics of capture vs release emerge organically through objects and action. The final reweighting (mirrors as doorways) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermonizing, though one sentence borders on explicit statement. The glass mountains motif evolves from lure to communal song charging the orchard. Ambiguity lingers productively around the “cost” of letting the dream go.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme integrates through action: apology as nourishment, vows as deciduous, generational repair through humble objects. Symbols earn their weight (ribbon → comet lash → rot → fragrance) without sermonizing; the line “Promises are leaves…” is character-grounded and recontextualizes the premise. The final repricing (broken contracts photosynthesize into hope) lingers with cost and possibility. Complexity remains, as forgiveness is deferred to the orchard rather than decreed.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around inheritance, failure, and the ethics of knowledge; the plumbing metaphor (“mind… both vessel and waste”) carries subtext without sermonizing. The bathroom‑breakthrough sequence reframes doors and choice, culminating in a refusal that reweights ancestry. The pink “correction fluid” flame is a sharp thematic image of revision. The incomplete last line trims some resonance that the shuttle‑lavatory coda might have sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of absence as corrective knowledge, renegotiated narratives, and the ethics of rescue emerge organically through repeated images (seeds, gaps, cello note) and choices. The final act of releasing “absences” reframes restoration as subtraction rather than accumulation, a potent conceptual twist. No moral is stated; resonance comes from particulars and an earned, quiet reweighting. The “unheard symphony” motif accrues meaning and culminates with a charged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, naming, and the refusal of burning solace are earned through concrete images and choices. The final redefinition (“not a place but a moment”) reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. Recurring objects (swatch, mirrors, name-tags) gain complexity at the end. A hair closer to stating the thesis than ideal, but still resonant and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of absence as deferred remembrance, forgiveness vs. forgetting, and ethical archiving develop organically through objects and acts rather than overt moralizing. The final image (door that shouldn’t exist fading; notebook that keeps translating; clock measuring distance between forgotten and forgiven) reweights the premise. One explanatory sentence (“She understood: the Meridian Embassy…”) edges into tell, but it clarifies stakes without flattening resonance. Subtext runs through tactile motifs (silk temperatures, merged arrow) with a lingering aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of silence as agency, preservation, and resistance accrues through concrete acts rather than thesis. The last whisper—“We were here”—reprices the whole piece without moralizing, translating sound into meaning. Subtext in the Warden and refugee fish deepens the stakes of memory and erasure. Complexity lingers: victory is charged by loss (expended voices, a relic breaking).

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—meaning wrested from coincidence, keeping a small light alive—emerges from concrete images (shards, starlight, voices backward) and culminates in a reweighted final image. The echo of saved voices ties personal motive to communal memory. Slight explicitness (“not accidents but refractions of one intention”) edges toward stating the thesis. Nonetheless, resonance lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of memory, identity, and witness over ownership emerges organically through action (measurement, tribute, map). The signature-as-witness reweights everything, transforming into a child’s future spiral urge—an elegant conceptual repricing. Subtextual exchange (tribute for borrowed memories) carries moral cost without sermonizing. The ending invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: transforming despair into communal wonder through “serious playfulness.” Motifs (chant, gravity/ascent, mosaic notes, rag) evolve meaning, culminating in new stars that reprices the world’s hush. No moralizing; the final choice to descend toward a child gives an earned, open‑handed answer. The piece invites reflection on art as defiance without flattening into allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of transition, patience, and time’s texture emerge organically through concrete motifs (tide pool as held ocean, cicada’s delayed song, erasing footprints). Subtext is strong in shared observation and silence. However, two explicit thesis-like lines (“Listen to the pool…”; “every pause is a cocoon”) tip toward didactic, slightly reducing the earned resonance. The ending still reweights the premise through image, but restraint there would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: naming/collecting quiet versus releasing it; survival tactics versus freedom. The final image reweights the premise—liberation through renunciation rather than accumulation—without moralizing. Subtext in silence flavors, gravity’s reversal, and the chrysalis doll resonates beyond the scene. The cost of keeping the bunker inside her versus breathing widened air is elegantly held.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Silence as care, motion as listening, and fear as weather cohere without moralizing. The confession about a child reframes the ride’s lesson into a human cost, and the re-crystallization literalizes theme. Recurring images (whistles, prisms, glass, decibels) accrue meaning and shift at the end. The piece invites reflection without tidy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme—balancing tradition and progress, history’s stewardship over power—emerges organically from murals, tech-magic locks, and the crown’s reconstitution. However, it edges into telling (“wasn’t about claiming power—it was about accepting responsibility”) which blunts subtext. The final image resonates but explains itself. Still, the particulars (ruby, murals, throne) support a cohesive thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of liminality, earned release, and the paradox of “suffocating to breathe” arise from image and act, with strong motif recurrence (ring, scars, breath). The final memory of “first real breath” reweights the premise effectively. A direct thesis line (“Sometimes we must learn to die properly…”) telegraphs meaning and trims nuance. Otherwise, subtext carries in gesture and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of extraction economies, forgiveness as currency, and transmutation of shame arise from action, not lecture. The aphoristic line about “borrowed gravity” edges toward statement yet is anchored in her renunciation choice. Final constellation “void” stamp and calmed tide provide a resonant, non‑literal answer. Multiple motifs (pressure, invoices, lumens) reconfigure coherently at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of inheritance, guilt, and truth-as-bridge emerge organically through objects and acts rather than moralizing. Recurring images (golden shadows, river, maps/ink) reweight at the end when blood and ink bind heir to history. The quiet intervention of Muse keeps subtext alive around custodianship of stories. The final public reading offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to whether truth can redeem or only recalibrate.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of failure as compost and possibility as cultivated, not seized, emerge through particular images (mercury roots, greenhouse as question, seed covenant) rather than abstract moralizing. The final realization reweights prior motifs without neat platitude, and the EXIT fireflies for “the lost” provide a resonant counter‑reading. One explicit thematic articulation (“what would you harvest if failure were merely compost?”) edges toward declaration but remains earned by scene pressure. The incomplete last sentence nicks the afterglow a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, custodianship, and kindness-as-archive emerge through action and image (dust patterns “reading,” database provenance, the cautious note). The closing snow as accrued kindness reweights the whole and avoids moralizing; sentiment is largely earned. One explicit thesis line (“archives are futures disguised as pasts”) edges toward didactic, but prior particulars support it. Subtext—responsibility vs. comfort—remains active in her measured acts.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres—memory vs. institutional indifference—through specific actions (reverse-broadcasting truth via copper). Subtext accrues via images (Morse starlight, puddle frequencies) rather than exposition. The aphorism “Indifference is a lock; memory is the key” tilts toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing subtlety. Final reconfiguration lets the city “hear itself,” offering earned resonance beyond a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through event and image: music answering code, silence as agency, inheritance vs. fate. Recurring motifs (negative space, breath on winter glass, dew) are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on how absence (erasure) can be an act, with human cost. Nostalgia and communal expectation braid in subtly via the mother and villagers.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Reciprocity, memory, and covenant emerge organically from concrete acts (monuments, weighted leaves), and the final image reweights those motifs. However, the explicit thesis line (“The forgotten thing is the covenant…”) and the named moral (“Reciprocity”) undercut subtext in the final third. Resonance persists via the transformed landscape and seed‑gleam, but the moralizing trims ambiguity. Thematic integration is strong despite that blunt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars—broken clocks, a handless mechanism, a compass with no north—culminating in “time as waterfall.” The final images (leaf‑compass, synchronized glow, citywide 3:17) reprice certainty without tidy moral. One explicit thesis line (“to befriend uncertainty...”) edges toward didactic, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The kintsugi ethos and the “weight of names” integrate through actions and images that reweight earlier details at the end (wells tasting of birthdays; coin singing in rain). Subtext hums: redemption as shared water rather than private relic, grief as infrastructure. One explicit aphorism (“to redeem is not to erase the break but to illuminate it”) edges toward telling but is earned by the scene’s labor. The resonance lingers without tidy symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of grief, repair, and the ethics of integrating pain rather than erasing it are dramatized via specific acts (letting the “wrong notes” sing). One sentence edges toward explicit thesis, but it is grounded by concrete action and doesn’t over-moralize the ending. The final images (gorge softening; empty cord; footprints glowing) reweight the premise with quiet resonance. Subtext hums in ritual, silence, and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: mercy as a limit approached, not a gift, earned through embodied struggle. The equations evolve from conceit to moral calculus, culminating in a reweighted final image. Subtext about empire’s ledger adds acid without sermonizing. Insight is earned through particulars, not declared morals.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of stewardship, return, and memory cohere through recurring light/sea/market images and culminate in a felt repricing of “keeping” as “letting go.” Subtext works through action (the exchange) and images (spiraled lanterns, makeshift lighthouse), lingering beyond the page. Slight explicitness (“intuition is not a compass but a tide,” “We keep the light by letting it go”) edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, shaving subtlety. The resonance still lands due to the specificity of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Repair, vertical desire, and time’s coiled burden interweave through recurring particulars (ceiling, dust spirals, gears). The ending reweights the premise: she will distribute the ghosts via elevators—stories as cargo—without moralizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“the cracks…were not in the walls but in herself”), but it pays off the established imagery. Subtext hums in the calliope burst and “weightless burden raining upward.”

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: rupture as invitation, not destruction; language as world‑making; breath/time compressed into print and body. The title sentence reinterprets reality and reweights earlier images (frost grammar, mirror‑keeper, orrery). No moralizing; resonance arrives through the final charged image and conceptual cost. The “shorter path between heartbeats” becomes a precise thematic answer without thesis stating.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of time, memory, and the political force of art emerge via concrete acts (blood on shard; elegy vs. evidence) rather than sermonizing. The closing reprices history—“Civilizations fall; the poem remains”—and then the letters shifting beyond human language deepens that claim without flattening it into a moral. The guild dispute is reframed as a smaller argument under a larger collapse, which lingers. Ambiguity is meaningful, not murky.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of truth as lubricant, repair as alignment, and personal honesty unlocking communal light emerge through concrete acts. The “mending what isn’t torn” motif deepens from paradox to ethic. The ending offers a resonant repricing (lies to sparks) without moralizing. One line edges toward aphorism (“always requiring someone...”), but it’s earned by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: beginnings, industry’s silence, tribute versus testimony, translation over drowning. “Hinged awakenings” shifts from image to ontology as Ivy becomes the hinge, a conceptually rich answer to her quest. No moralizing; the final whistle within her recasts the town and self in one resonant gesture. Ambiguity remains meaningful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of reciprocity, ledgered rescue/debt, and craft as ethical attention emerge organically through action and recurring images (spiral, fleet, barnacles, wood curls as “words forgiven”). The ending offers a resonant answer—choosing unmarked maps and shared time over instrument certainty—without moralizing. Subtext in the sailors’ layered gestures enriches communal stakes over solitary genius. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of shadow as nutritive, memory as color, and earned seeing emerge through concrete acts (pinning postcards to pour sunlight; painting panes as negative space). Several aphoristic lines (“The shadow is the root of the glow”) skate close to overt thesising but feel mostly earned by prior image‑work. The “dark remembers what the day forgets” reweights the premise effectively. The truncated final clause slightly undercuts the resonant after‑ring.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of memory as currency, archival ethics, and intergenerational betrayal arise from concrete acts, not thesis statements. The lagoon functions as a living cipher that reframes truth as a traded future—a potent metaphor integrated with plot. The ending offers a resonant answer: the duty to voice names outweighs personal absolution, with cost embraced. Ambiguity remains (crown or crucify), deepening the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory as method, anti‑wish ethics, and communal reinvention emerge through images and acts rather than thesis, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the bottle. The line “you are only a record of our last error” is a touch explicit but still image‑bound. The final constellation (mandala reordering, blueprint inversion) reweights prior motifs. Resonance lingers beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of promise, memory, grief, and endurance emerge organically from objects and acts (wax as ink, vows in beeswax, “to remain”). The final image reweights the premise: the archive flips and archives him, and the city’s ache replaces the orchard. No moralizing—resonance comes via image and implication. The “remaining” verb threads a precise, earned answer to the piece’s question about vows and survival.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of inheritance-as-debt emerges organically through seed-saving, entropy work, and renunciation; the final acts reweight the opening promise-breaking image. Subtext sits in actions and objects (library before shelves burn), with a resonant conceptual aftertaste. The explicit sapling line (“Every inheritance is a debt...”) edges toward moralizing, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall coherence and image-led meaning remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—listening over noise, courtesy to the world—emerges organically through images (bell vs. siren, father’s hum vs. silence) and is reweighted at the end. A single explicit thesis line (“never about prediction but about courtesy”) slightly overstates what the images already carry. Subtext otherwise works through restraint and the charged swap of sacred/civic. The ending invites reflection without neat universalizing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme integrates through particulars: the lantern’s memory-hoarding, the meteor’s history, and the final “atmosphere not armor” insight reconfigure strength as permeable. The meteor’s nonverbal “primal elegance” question avoids sermonizing and deepens the moral calculus. One line states the thesis somewhat explicitly, but the surrounding images prevent didactic flattening. The ending invites reflection via motif reprise rather than moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of covenant, memory, and the ethics of holding silence emerges organically through bees/comb/weight motifs. The final revaluation (“not a chain but a comb”) and the whispered vow reweight prior images without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and mute exchange, producing a resonant afterimage (clover scent). The insight feels earned through particulars, not dictum.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: when numbers fail, stories and sensations become currency and time’s texture. The urn fragment’s reweighting and the tag‑economy dramatize meaning rather than assert it. The realization precedes the ending, so the last line doesn’t further reprice, but resonance persists. No sermonizing; images carry the argument.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through torn objects, partial music, and the spiral’s unwinding into tide. Subtext operates through image and action, and the ending reweights prior motifs. The explicit thesis line (“Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use.”) borders on moralizing, softening the purity of the image‑led resonance. Still, the piece avoids sentimentality by letting erasure stand as answer.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of de‑centering the human architect and fostering interspecies parliament accrue through concrete events. The diary line “Architecture is only complete when it forgets the architect” risks over‑explicitness but is voiced in character and earned by the action. The handoff to the new caretaker reweights legacy and collaboration without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Commodification of belonging and the ethics of memory are woven through concrete images (footprints residue, statue, pendant) and culminate in a reweighted definition of “home.” Some thesis lines (“They were collecting… bottling it like perfume”) verge on didactic. The final image resists neat moralizing while retaining urgency. Subtext generally lives in the objects and patterning rather than speech.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Reconciliation through ecology, language, and memory emerges from particulars (seed pods, barnacle “drums,” children’s secret vines) without moralizing. Recurring images reprice meaning at the end (iron → roots; battle‑cry → pollen; names pronounced by bees). The “narrow vastness” motif matures into an earned, unsentimental mercy. Ambiguity remains alive (gift or accusation) while stance is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: distance vs. closeness, translation across senses, relics reanimating the living. The leaf’s “tinted revelations” evolve from memory to mechanism to communal repricing (the wind’s new scent). Subtext operates through image rather than statement; the brother’s final line elegantly closes the thematic loop. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (compass/true north, sketching ritual, silence) accrue and transform meaningfully at the end. The theme—reframing confusion as exploration and grief as a temporal pocket—emerges from action and image. Slight on-the-nose articulation via the mother’s quoted maxim and the final caption trims subtlety but doesn’t collapse resonance. Emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of wonder over rule, theft-as-liberation, and amendment of truth emerges organically from action and recurring objects. The final image (child opens lid; new stairs carve upward) reweights prior material without stating a moral. The line “I steal only what people no longer dare to keep” risks thesis‑ness but is earned by the surrounding scene and does not flatten the resonance. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of authorship, ethical remembrance, and power’s revisionism emerge via action (walking-script, naming “Adel,” lace noose on the queen) rather than thesis. Subtext in the exchanged “moves” and the missing pawns mirrors class absence without didacticism. The final charged image reweights the premise: history as luminous absence, preserved through chosen concealments. Ambiguity lingers productively—no neat moral, just a credible credo with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of home as necessary rather than safe emerges through image (homes seeded, mountain‑as‑home for stories) and action (self‑inscription). However, the explicit line “Home is not where you are safe—it is where you are necessary” functions as a thesis in the finale, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the costed renunciation of the shell gives the insight weight. Ambiguity remains around future harms, which is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motifs (labyrinth, king, thunder, tapestry) braid into a resonant argument about reframing loss. Subtext largely arises from image and action rather than explanation. The final aphorism (“The board is wider than the mistake”) edges toward stated moral, slightly thinning the earned resonance. Still, the reweighted images carry genuine aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The price of forgiveness is dramatized rather than moralized; her “coin” line is recontextualized by the later realization that the price is listening. The fracture of the spire and the feather literalize refracted/sharable truth, transforming blame into a communal resonance. The final note—“a story learning to breathe”—offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic throughline—restoration’s meaning versus mercy’s absence—emerges from particulars (kintsugi, constellation, transferred weight). The final image reweights the premise: “memory endures beyond the vessel.” Slight thematic echo in the declarative “Meaning achieved. Memory endures…” edges toward stating the thesis, modestly reducing subtlety. Still, resonance lingers via the charm’s ascent and the statue’s forgiving gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of “temporary eternity” emerges organically from action and image, not assertion, and the phrase is earned when his tactics change to match it. The ending reweights all images—mirror, quay, shell, plankton—into a durable answer about preservation vs erasure. Ambiguity is meaningful: he saves meaning, not matter, with a cost. No sermonizing; resonance lingers on the trade between visibility and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Softness vs. force emerges through recurring particulars (pulse‑tuned light, scent language, cork prism) rather than lecture. The realization about the mother reframes love, loss, and communication without closing ambiguity. Slight thematic overstatement appears in the spoken maxim (“The softer we become…”), nudging toward didactic. Still, the ending’s image carries the resonance more than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of grief as navigable terrain emerges through action, not sermon, and the body‑as‑map conceit evolves into a final repricing. Recurrent images (dish, moon, censer foot, spiral) shift meaning at closure. “Reverse migration is not travel but translation” crystallizes subtext earned by preceding beats. The final folklore tag widens resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Truth, secrecy, and communal containment emerge through image and choice (roots drinking confession; eyes as lanterns teaching “fractured grace”). The final reweighting—that safety is ecological, not individual—lands without moralizing. A single explicit term (“psychological safety” as label) slightly flattens subtext. Overall, resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: keepers as witnesses between seen/erased; memory as debt vs. duty. The Edelweiss’s repricing from gift to loan reweights prior images and anchors the moral calculus. The ending’s quiet reconfiguration (“attending,” not “investigating”) resonates without stating a moral. Subtext in the logbook line and reflection‑lag avoids didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motifs (maps, ants, water, the shifting O/D) thread into a coherent meditation on choice, cartography, and self‑authorship. The final reweighting—loneliness as a daily redrawn map—resonates and retrofits earlier images. A slight on‑the‑nose line (“loneliness was itself a choice”) edges toward statement over subtext, shaving some subtlety. Still, the O/zero image as origin is a strong non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of memory, identity, and self-authored fate emerges through image and action, not sermonizing. The loop reframes prophecy as memory, reweighting prior material with a resonant moral cost. The last image (a hidden crown burning above clouds) sustains ambiguity without confusion. One small neatness: the universal restoration of her name borders on tidy but remains earned by the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of presence vs. preservation emerges organically via actions and images, culminating in a non‑literal answer (share and release instead of trap). The nautilus and pocket‑sun recur with reweighted meaning. A few explicit thesis‑like lines risk overstatement but the closing image resists moralizing. Subtext in Mira’s gesture and their long‑stored secret carries real resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through action and image: time as wheel vs ladder, narrative futility, and erasure as continuation. Recurring motifs (scroll, eagle flight, wind as a page turn, stone) reweight at the end. A few explicit statements (“every story ends mid‑sentence”) risk over‑articulation but are earned by scene pressure. The final stance offers a resonant answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of loss-as-instrument and ordinary miracles arise from particulars (fog, float, clamp, newborn gasp) rather than thesis statements. The final images reprice the world’s texture without scent, avoiding sentimentality. One slightly on‑the‑nose sentence (“her motivation accomplished…”) trims the edge of purity. Overall, subtext hums through gesture and object rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through enacted images—breath as text, scars as stories—without moralizing. Recurring motifs (crystallization, steam, silence/hush) shift meaning at the end, repricing the initial superstition into agency. The teacher’s single line catalyzes subtext (“The storm listens now”) rather than stating a thesis. The final exhalation and slight lift render an answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of exploitation, ownership of pain, and the limits of atonement emerge through material choices (sound as apology, fading notes) rather than sermon. “Pain is public domain” edges toward explicitness, but the surrounding images keep it earned. The “imperfect miracle” reframes forgiveness as partial, costly circuitry—conceptual repricing that lingers. The last images reweight earlier motifs without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through image and event: endings and beginnings as a folded circle, self as center of spiral arbitration. The mirrored sentence risks thesis-statement proximity but is dramatized as an on-page phenomenon, not authorial summary, and it reweights prior beats. The final image (pure notation; “here, the curve unifies”) offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around identity and continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    Resonant motifs (drops as surrendered forgetting, key, fjord) support the theme of time as distance from becoming. However, the thesis is articulated directly multiple times, including in the final paragraph (“what clocks truly measure...”), which reads like moralizing and blunts subtext. The piece still invites reflection via the ending’s identity dissolve. Less telling would lift the thematic afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of engineered closure versus authentic letting‑go emerges through action and image rather than moralizing, with Dr. Voss’s sales‑pitch line sharpening, not flattening, the critique. The final image—light dispersing as grief is relinquished—reprices the premise without tidy answers about identity. Recurring motifs (light, spores, permeability) shift meaning under the ending. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme coheres through particulars: probability as nostalgia, the “honest casino,” the clover motif, and the rewritten scrawl. The ending reweights the premise—responsible widening reframed as forgiveness—without moralizing; the final image carries the argument. Subtext hums in the father/daughter ledger and in turning the house’s matches against it. Any aphoristic lines are earned through scene work and object pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of loops, beginnings, and earned endings emerge through recurring images and choices rather than moralizing. The advice “Find the loop you’re terrified of and step one frame beyond it” reweights the final act of leaving. Subtext in the exchanged object (disc) and the withheld name work as quiet ethics about connection. Resonance lingers without closing into a single tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Memory as covenant, artifacts as verbs, and “proximate causes” accrue into a resonant meditation without collapsing into moral. The locket’s sacrifice reframes preservation as participatory and costly, not mere observation. A single line risks declarative thesis (“When context changes... artifacts become verbs”) but is earned by surrounding scene-work. The ending’s musical image reweights the motifs with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of reciprocity versus solitude is enacted, not declared: rumor chains, paired shards, “paid in laughter, no change given” crystallize value and cost. The “polite anarchy” of kindness reframes logistics and rumor as social infrastructure. The final broadcast and renamed station reweight earlier images without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively about permanence and the ethics of catalysis.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of embodiment and self-cartography emerges from particulars (sound as Braille, ring translating vibration into map). The ending offers a resonant answer—one must become the map—without moralizing. Recurring images (“quiet blaze,” constellations’ pause) deepen meaning at closure. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection without blur.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around uncertainty as a disciplined practice, not a shrug; motifs (seeds, gardening, filaments, lullaby) evolve meaningfully to support that idea. The mentor’s line risks explicitness but feels earned by context. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: “strange comfort translated into bone” and planting spiral questions embody the philosophy. Ambiguity remains purposeful without muddying.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of absence as presence and memory versus record cohere through objects and acts, not lecture: the empty camera, sign language, and harbor sounds recontextualized as rests. Subtext thrives in gesture (silent tears, open palm bow, repeat sign) and in the advisor’s aphorisms that feel diegetic rather than authorial. The final image offers a non‑literal answer—music exists in the now, not in capture—without moralizing. Resonance lingers with plausible counter‑readings about art, grief, and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme is coherent—fire as revelation and the necessity of burning to preserve truth—and images recur meaningfully (eyes, heat, tapestry, ashes). However, the story states its thesis explicitly in lines like “Her arson had never been about destruction” and “sometimes we must destroy to truly save,” blunting subtext. The final image reweights prior material effectively despite the didactic edges. Ambiguity around moral cost is touched, not deeply interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: sound as memory, rebellion as devotion, unity over individuation. Recurring images (auric lagoon, hush, drumming) reweight meaning at the end without sermonizing. One explanatory sentence about the scientists mildly flirts with telling, but the closing image carries the resonance. The piece invites reflection without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of quiet power vs. noisy modernity emerges organically through action and objects (maps, whisper lock, coins). The intergenerational network offers resonant subtext. However, the explicit thesis line (“sometimes the quietest voices travel farthest”) edges into moralizing, blunting subtlety. The ending still reweights prior material with a clear conceptual aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as empathy reframes darkness from malice to loneliness, rendered via action (vibration transfer, light patterns) rather than moralizing. Recurring images (mirror, shutters, spirals) accrue meaning and reweight at the end. One near‑explicit sentence (“darkness was not evil but lonely”) risks didacticism but is earned by the concrete preceding sequence. The final charged poise honors complexity: understanding must be renewed daily.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: rebellion as rewilding of rules, “losing” teaching the game, and objects shifting meaning. Subtext lives in small confessions (cashier, janitor) that align with the central question without sermonizing. The final image reweights everything toward living systems over fixed systems. A single thesis-tinged line (“what if losing…”) is overt but supported by action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Weapon‑to‑kelp transformation and “detachment” reframe freedom as refusing translation of self into others’ demands. Subtext operates through images (scrimshaw warmth, combative tenderness, whale as chorus) rather than lecture. One line states the thesis explicitly, trimming the lingering ambiguity slightly. Resonance remains strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of grief-as-soil, art-as-defiance, and complicity versus repair arise from concrete acts (whittled feather jamming machinery, planting bare stems). Subtext is carried by image, gesture, and silence; the officer’s scratched badge and “performance suspended” line avoid sermonizing while reweighting the frame. The crow’s line reframes guilt as portable, tying ethics to action. Aphoristic moments (“Grief is soil”) are earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme (law as mutable light; borders as provisional containers) emerges through paraphrase enacted on the world, not just asserted. Several images reweight at the end (ice becomes chorus; contract rescinding itself; rumor as continued motion). One overt thesis line (“For every law is a rough draft of light…”) flirts with moralizing, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, resonance lingers as readers confront the costs of fluidity versus certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance is strong through images (reed song, ash rising, spiral of shards) that reframe beauty as brokenness. However, the piece states its thesis multiple times (“we are most alive where we are broken,” “we trade our wounds not to heal them...”), edging into overt moralizing and reducing subtext. The best moments show the theme (smashing the glass) rather than say it. Trimming explicit aphorisms would heighten lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rich thematic weave—mourning vs. transforming silence; authenticity within the “artificial”—emerges from recurring images and communal action. However, explicit thesis lines (“artificial pilgrimage was not lesser...”) verge on sermonizing and reduce subtext. The final image still resonates, with cost implied in renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonance is strong in images (hair, vellum, coordinates, candles), and the ending reweights the premise without mechanical neatness. However, explicit thesis statements (“death was not the opposite of life…”) verge on didactic, reducing subtext. The best thematic work is embedded in action—the sacrificing of the stencil and redefinition of her craft. A touch more implication and less declaration would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: prophecy versus geometry, inherited responsibility, and capitalism’s speculative faith recoded as mystic circuitry. The final image conceptually reprices the premise: maps as infinite regress, footprints as currency when ledgers fail. The grandmother thread roots the “inherited mystery” without sermonizing. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the cost of knowing what no one will hear.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: memory as beautiful contamination rather than cleansing, realized through concrete actions and recurrences. The pagoda and atoms of nostalgia reweight meaning in the close without sermonizing. One line edges toward thesis statement (“to purify wasn’t to erase”) but the surrounding images earn it. Ambiguity persists productively in the notion of shared burden and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: noticing endings vs. shareable dreams; hope as shape; stone as repository. The final image reweights the premise—preservation demands personal vanishing—without sermonizing. One or two lines verge on explicit thesis (“She understood the softly deliberate choice…”) but they largely remain earned by scene. The “luminous regret” tone crystallizes the paradox without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme arises organically: trust, culpability, and the price of care reweighted through the ritual and the final release. The plaque’s vows convert grief into an ethic without sermonizing. The ending’s charged poise (walking away poorer in pride, richer in doubt) offers a resonant non-literal answer. Symbolic elements (tail tips, cedar) accrue meaning rather than dictate it.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of grief, time, and translating scars into story emerge through specific images and acts, not summary. Recurrences (hourglass, rings, wound) reweight meaning at the end; the “period” line elegantly reframes the wound. The final plant sentence risks slight didactic shading, but remains in‑world and earned. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of stored/unused love, projection, and release cohere and culminate in the film‑to‑body threading image. Subtext largely works through images and actions (looping film, balcony, hushed thunder → rain). The line “Love is never unused...” edges into explicit thesis; it fits diegetically but slightly blunts the lingering ambiguity. Overall resonance is strong despite that near‑moral.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of reclaimed creativity versus institutional suppression emerges through concrete images (crayon nebulae vs. chalk cupboard) and is resolved non‑literally via her transformation into a conduit. The sky’s phrase risks thesis‑statement territory, but its diegetic delivery through meteors keeps it embedded. The ending reweights prior material—rest as surrender and creation—without a moral. Aftertaste is resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory versus annihilation, song as transport, and time’s divergence to reconcile grief. Recurring images (clock, names, poppies, “occasionally everywhere”) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. The final cadence answers the central question without moralizing: what burns never truly sleeps because song alters time. Ambiguity stays purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of renunciation, distribution of self, and method over destination emerge from concrete acts and motifs. The gear’s surrender reweights earlier images; the ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer. Slight explicitness (“You are not lost; you are distributed.” and “not a place but a method”) trims subtlety but doesn’t undercut the earned resonance. Subtext largely operates in image and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Coherent theme (courage recognized within; duty chosen vs. imposed) is earned through the stamped partnership and restored order. However, the text overstates its thesis at points (“unused courage wasn’t something to be found but acknowledged”), edging into moralizing. Subtext exists in the partnership reframing and the lullaby tone but could trust image over paraphrase more. Resonance is present but not layered into ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: safety’s arithmetic and the ethics of enforced silence. Recurring images (bolt, discoloration, lullaby/snow/choir) shift meaning and charge the ending without moralizing. The final repricing—safety as a ledger that buries them—lingers and invites complex counter-readings. Subtext runs in gesture and silence rather than statements.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Truth versus glamour and the ethics of balance accrue through particulars (rust scent, drift, library as memory). The closing line in the colophon risks thematic articulation, but its diegetic placement as a marginal note mitigates moralizing. The “mercy of forgetting” subtly reframes justice and cost. Recurring images reweight meaning without heavy-handedness.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—witnessing beyond proof, memory as re-seeding—emerges from particulars (tapping, maps, pillars storing ecosystems). The ending reframes the role from archivist of loss to guide for regrowth without moralizing. Recurring images reprice meaning (“three short, two long,” “drifting moored”). Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of reclamation through beauty and resonance emerges organically from acts (song, stones, swallows, consoles waking). The “lull as breath” reframes rebellion with a resonant conceptual turn. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“her motivation sharpened…”) but the final image earns the insight. Subtext of inheritance (mother’s lullaby) and stewardship threads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of resisting imposed destiny through intentional, tradition‑evolving care emerges through particulars (gardener metaphors, epigenetic quilting, plant complicity). Subtextual alliance between nonhuman life and insurgent lineage complicates power and inheritance. The ending’s “why” reframes the council’s program without preachiness, though it edges close to neatness. Motifs (kite, water, plants) recur with deepened meaning rather than token symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: optimism with memory, grief as coastline, persistence through living matter. The recurring images (resin, photo, lighthouse/trees) reweight meaning at the end without forced symbolism. Two explicit “I think:” lines edge toward statement, but they’re anchored in scene and do not replace pressure. The final covenant provides a resonant, non‑literal answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of art versus memory/absence deepens through particulars (negative space, “absence the purest pigment,” shore repainted by waves) rather than thesis. The final image conceptually reprices the premise: the portrait becomes a door into necessary darkness, a truer fracture rather than wholeness. Ambiguity lingers without confusion (villagers’ question; waves as answer). No sermonizing; resonance arrives by image and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The motif lattice (ink, wind, hourglass, portal) builds a coherent meditation on time and crisis. However, the piece tips into explicit thesis—“They had discovered why time slows in crisis...” and the final sentence restates the moral—dampening subtext. The best resonance is in the image of choosing to live “a thousand years in a single heartbeat,” which could stand without overt explanation. Overall strong, but the moralizing edge trims its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, censorship, and custodial ethics emerge through concrete action and recurring images (ice/heat, sleep/waking, silence/aurora). Subtext resides in the archivist becoming both guardian and arsonist of truth. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“without honest memory, no future generation could choose wisely”), but it’s earned by preceding beats. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of inheritance, transformation, and reconciliation arise from particulars (blood-brightened blooms, canvas weave in stems) rather than thesis. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the root-pulse and site-specific planting. Occasional explicitness (“creating living memorials”) nudges toward statement but does not undercut the earned resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Echo/listener reciprocity and divinity‑as‑conversation emerge organically from repeated particulars (silence as net, the spike as conduit, “Stay”). The final reweighting answers the initial question without moralizing, and images reprise with altered meaning (feral lullaby turns gentle; spike as “tongue” learning language). Ambiguity is purposeful yet coherent, sustaining reflection beyond the scene. No thematic overstatement undercuts subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of truth’s mutability, journalism’s ethics, and regret reframed as a widenable orbit emerge through specific acts (rewriting the sky; reflecting sparks into microfiche). The recurring logic device (“proof by contradiction”) grounds abstraction in concrete struggle. One explicit thematic line (“means sometimes the tool breaks with the falsehood”) flirts with telling but is earned by the break. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motifs (amber insect, meteor hush, haunted firmware) evolve into a resonant answer about releasing rather than embodying guilt. The lab’s conceptual turn (it cultivates, not archives) reframes prior images without moralizing. The final emptiness of the amber reweights the whole in a concrete, emotionally credible way.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme—meaning as a repeated motion, not a kept shape—emerges from concrete events (erasure, scattering, blanking) rather than sermon. The tile’s line risks aphorism, but it’s earned by the object’s history and the hush’s congregational reframe. The ending reweights earlier images (spirals, lilac unease) into a lived ethic of impermanence that lingers. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme integrates through action and image—knowledge as burden/blessing; mercy in forgetting—culminating in the multi‑valent final figure (book/child/flame/seed). However, the line “the greatest mercy lay not in what we chose to remember, but in what we allowed ourselves—and others—to forget” states the thesis outright, softening subtext. The CR still resonates. Ambiguity is meaningful without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory-as-performance, communal remembrance, and possibility vs despair surface through image and action (applause from leaves; orchard existing via mourners). The final repricing—an “endless encore” borne privately—reweights the premise without moralizing. One line edges toward thesis (“make them feel time is a song they almost remember”) but remains embodied enough to avoid didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of connection vs. skepticism and art as conduit emerge through concrete images (web of light, dark voids of grief, dotted line escape) rather than lecture. The final photograph holds a conceptual repricing: ephemeral telepathy becomes a durable record of community. A few thesis‑leaning lines (“some truths couldn’t be measured”) edge toward didacticism, slightly softening subtext. Still, the motif of “hidden pathways” evolves persuasively into enacted care.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through action and image: translation vs. silence, bridges that refuse shores, witness as relinquishment. The fossil’s reweighting from leaf to seed of resonance embodies “transitional objects” without didacticism. The ending answers the question—how to voice the unknown—by letting it speak through her, at cost. Resonance lingers in the “lighthouse without fire” image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme arises organically: buttons as witnesses and re-fastening as communal futurity; prophecy becomes thread rather than threat. Subtext operates through silence-as-knowledge and scent-as-wisdom, avoiding didactic summary even when the garment metaphor surfaces. The final act—sharing warm silence—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Motifs (hourglass, jar, buttons, amber) all reweight at closure without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of courage-as-repair and the ethics of espionage emerges through action and image, not moralizing. The “gardeners of possible futures” line resonates because it’s grounded in their shared past and is paid off by the snowdrop and the broadcast. The final image reweights prior material into a quiet, durable answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful without muddying stance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of promise, memory, and transmutation accrue through concrete motifs (palimpsest, thread, ferry) and reweight at the end. The final image answers the core question without moralizing: a man carrying a single drop of all stories. One line edges toward thesis-y (“every promise is a ferry…”) but it grows from earned particulars. Resonance lingers via the cost of identity shed and meaning condensed.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic integration is strong—craft as memory, kindness as a phototropic force, stewardship over conquest—and images shift meaning at the end (jar, fruit, lantern, suns). However, the explicit moral line “memory travels forward only when carried by kindness” veers into final‑paragraph sermonizing, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the closing covenant with the child and the charged objects deliver resonance without over‑explaining elsewhere. The piece invites reflection without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Light versus confinement, translation versus theft, and care as subversion emerge organically from action and recurring images (petal, oars, moon, lavender). “Every oar is a promise” flirts with aphorism yet is earned by the story’s pattern. The final image reweights prior motifs into a durable answer about sustaining courage. Sentiment is held in check by concrete, specific acts.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of solitude versus independence emerges organically through concrete acts (placing the sundial, splitting memory, “teaching her lungs to photosynthesize independence”). The equation “solitude equals momentum” risks on‑the‑nose statement but is earned by the prior imagery and choice. The final prairie image (despite truncation) gestures toward a resonant reconfiguration of silence into agency. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—secrecy transmuted through art into communal music, self‑erasure into self‑authorship—emerges from concrete acts rather than commentary. Subtext is carried in images (paper boat absolution; bells aggregating anonymous confessions) and the “keeper of secrets” observing release. The spoken line “my heart became a palimpsest” risks explicitness but is earned by the ritualized scene and reweighted by the ending. The finale offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of belief as resource, false dichotomies, and the politics of trust are integrated and reweighted at the end. However, several lines state thesis outright (“They are coming for your trust,” “third option of simply walking away”), which blunts subtext. The altruism insight at climax lands but could be more earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of “wistful rebellion” against one’s limits fuses with cartography and mutinous space; the map that refuses becomes the map she chooses to carry. Mirrors and meridians recast identity and lineage without moralizing. The final turn reweights the premise: sealing claustrophobia underground to free the future. Resonance lingers through the key’s quiet knock and the unwritten map.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Opposites (seen/unseen, living/lost) unify through repeated images and culminate in the painting confronting the recovered mask. The piece interrogates communal memory and the ethics of looking without sermonizing, though “Evidence reborn; empathy may follow” edges toward explicit thesis. The final reconfiguration reweights the premise with social cost. Thematic strands arise from action rather than meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory vs. institutional denial, legacy, and “reversible exile” are dramatized through specific images and choices, not moralizing. The copper/verdigris motif and weather as archive elegantly reweight meaning at the end. The key question functions as subtext engine rather than thesis statement, returning reframed with communal breadth. The final image (maps refracting across rain) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of amnesty, possibility, grief, and craft-as-translation accrue through specific motifs (collodion pixels, tarp Morse, bridge‑song). The ending reweights prior images without moralizing: “never is just another pixel waiting to be moved.” Subtext around inheritance and risk persists in the father’s fall vs. new bridge. Resonance lingers with conceptual repricing rather than tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of belief-as-currency, circles versus exits, and inheritance are woven through concrete acts (spending by relinquishment). The final images reweight prior material without sermonizing, though one or two thesis‑leaning lines flirt with overtness. Resonance lingers through the money as maps and the orphaned tech vision. The slight cadence break at the end mutes the after‑ring.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    Resonance is strong—“shared burdens → shared light” reframes grief into communal cartography—and images echo with integrity (pollen‑ink, star Morse, midnight solace). However, thematic lines are occasionally stated outright (“Witness, speak, heal…”) edging toward didactic. The story largely earns its insights through specific acts and objects, and the final star wink reweights the whole. A touch more subtext over statement would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: confession versus preservation, nature as witness, war transposed into orchard and bone. The mirror’s refusal reframes truth as an act, not an object, and the ending’s charged poise resists tidy absolution. Recurring images (apples as skulls, siege-tower trunks) reweight the moral field without sermonizing. The final “timber of tomorrow’s storms” delivers conceptual repricing with lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of time as cultivated versus paved, wounds as doors, and communal dreaming develop through concrete images and acts, not lectures. The ending reweights the premise (covenant as photosynthesis; time “growing wild”) with emotional aftereffect. The gardener’s dictum is slightly declarative but supported by prior particulars. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rich thematic weave of trauma, memory economy, scars as doors, and the ethics of repair culminating in “weaving new cloth” with deliberate gaps. Subtext works through images (root‑ledgers, bone crowns, torn Star) and the protagonist’s re‑framing from client to witness. Slight deduct for the overt thematic aphorism “some holes must remain for the light to enter,” which edges toward moralizing. Even so, the final image reprices prior material without flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of applause vs. being needed, resonance, and foundations emerge from particulars and reweight at the end. The line “Applause wasn’t the prize; being needed was” tips toward explicit moralizing and slightly flattens subtext in a late beat. Otherwise the echoes, dust, and cloth do the quiet work, inviting reflection without sermonizing. The final cadence retains ambiguity about future cost in a productive way.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of translation, grief’s grammar, and transition accrue through images rather than lecture; the cuneiform sentence and “equation equal love divided by time” reweight meaning. “The departed become the grammar of the living” risks statement, but it’s diegetic and earned by prior action. The final line elegantly reinterprets “haunted ambitions” without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of identity as motion versus preservation emerges through particulars: net mesh, mutable ribbon, routine as wonder‑engine, water as memory. The ending offers a resonant answer—guard the unfinished still point now, release later—without stating a moral. Recurring objects reprice meaning (creel’s expansion ring) and resist platitude. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Connection through confession, memory, and forgiveness accrues via concrete images (calcified hopes, mineral ear, living-light crown). The ending offers a non-literal answer: become porous to transform pain into music—without moralizing. The mother/pearl reprise deepens the theme without collapsing into sentimentality. Ambiguity (salvation vs. entombed service) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of cartography vs. confession, inheritance vs. self-authorship, and forgiveness as backward-walking bridge emerge from particulars (graffiti, coordinates shift, the air-release). The ending reweights prior images without a didactic moral; the paper boat/accordion both redeem and relinquish. A couple of aphoristic turns risk neatness but remain diegetic and earned. Resonance lingers in the river’s indifferent continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of language as time-debt and silence as creation emerges through concrete acts (unsaid lie, traded lullaby) rather than statement. Recurring objects reweight meaning at the end, repricing omission: “The library survives in what you choose not to—”. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion. No moralizing; resonance is earned by image and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: propagation vs. commodification, order vs. polyphony, promises dimming into “maybe.” The coffee-reading and mulberry ache recur with new weight at the end, avoiding sermonizing. The unfinished lullaby as counter-anthem carries subtext about freedom’s dissonance and cost. The conceptual repricing of “destiny” as a network of paths lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—beauty as a shield/ferryman against forgetting—arises organically from tradecraft and ritual rather than sermon. The final image (“becomes a lantern,” “ferryman is the river”) conceptually reprices earlier motifs without moralizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“to believe beauty could be a ferryman”), but it’s earned by prior particulars. Ambiguity lingers productively about the ethics of self‑surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thematic throughline—contentment as direction (downward, into tending) vs. escape—emerges through action and charged objects. The hairpin’s fusion and implantation reprice debt into soil and grief into stewardship. One sentence edges toward explicit thesis (“contentment’s source was not a place but a direction”) but is supported by concrete beats, keeping sentimentality at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—welcoming nuance and refusing moral anesthesia—emerges organically from action, with strong subtext in the chimes and shard. The final cadence reweights prior images without didactic wrap‑up, though the last sentence’s “most honest position…” edges toward moralizing. The “coat you’ve outgrown” metaphor is effective and not overexplained. Complexity is preserved: cost is not erased, and grief is retained.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of patience, epistemic withholding, and the equivalence of appearing/vanishing are integrated through action (waiting for the final ring) and image (stone/pond). The last realization reweights prior material without needing a spelled‑out moral, though a few aphoristic lines brush the edge of didactic. The recurrence of the stone and future‑teacher implication adds resonance beyond the scene. Subtext about pedagogy and scientific secrecy sits cleanly under the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of memory, home, and stillness accrue organically from particulars (stone, wind, birds, dust) and reprised at closure with reweighted meaning. The final image answers the central question non‑literally: home is achieved by becoming the echo, not moving toward it. No sermonizing; resonance is earned through image systems and recurrence. The grandmother’s bequest ties lineage to identity in a way that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic spine—authenticity vs automation—emerges through concrete images (marigold, petal, cracked keystone) and culminates in a non‑literal answer: await the unplanned scatter, not the scheduled dawn. One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“the sacred was not hidden in cathedrals of data”), slightly on‑the‑nose. Nevertheless, the final charged poise carries the meaning without moralizing. Resonance lingers via the mailed petal “To Whoever Still Looks Up.”

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of vow, memory, and guidance emerge organically through objects and ritual, culminating in the image of sound as light that needs an eye. The festival, key, and cylinder braid into a coherent meditation on how promises persist and are witnessed. One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“every human sound is merely light…”), slightly reducing the subtlety otherwise achieved. The final lamps “singing” in color delivers a resonant, earned answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of meaning, memory, and atonement accrues through particulars: coins as apologies, the universe as listener, purpose only legible in reverse. The closing reprices the premise—becoming the carrier wave answers the story’s central question without moralizing. A few explicit formulations (“wasn’t a warning—it was a receipt”) slightly reduce the felt subtext. Overall resonance lingers and widens at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme (“the echo of sacrifice”) arises organically from recurring objects and acts, culminating in a conceptual reweighting that reframes death as debt. The paper boat/ledger/scraps reprise transforms sea monsters into named costs, resisting moral neatness while offering a path toward forgiveness. No sermonizing; the final pulse in his chest lands as earned resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively around the sufficiency of his act.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of faith as a physical force, communal memory, and devotion’s cost arise from repeated, specific actions (counting, offerings, dawn rites). The dolphin’s admonition and the final epitaph drip reweight meaning without over-explaining. A few explicit lines (“It just needed someone to understand the rate at which belief returns”) verge on telling but mostly harmonize with the concept. The ending resonates as a lived answer rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of private grief vs. communal memory emerges organically through images (label, photos, chime) rather than thesis. The ending’s “museum of common loss” is earned by concrete acts and allows layered counter-readings without sentimentality. Symbols shift meaning credibly (the label from nostalgia to relinquishment). No moralizing undercuts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically through actions and images—the crystal as crucible for harmony between axiom and astonishment. Subtext works via concrete particulars (starlings’ manuscript, the ribbon, the transparent fire). The final sentence edges into thesis articulation, slightly narrowing the lingering ambiguity. Still, the conceptual repricing at the end resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of the watcher’s burden and the ethics of vigilance emerges organically through object use and ritualized signals. The final image reweights prior material: preservation equals letting go. A few explicit lines (“She understood then…”) flirt with telling, but the transfer click and tally‑marks carry the resonance. Subtext lives in procedure-as-belief and the echo motif.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through action and image: complementary opposites, the ethics of custody and selfhood, and the cost of integration over binary victory. The final synthesis reweights prior material with resonant images (color and silence in the child). Slight explicitness in the closing line (“only by holding the opposite…”) softens ambiguity and edges toward a stated thesis. Nonetheless, subtext predominates elsewhere and the final image lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coherently marries innovation with surrender: a creator becomes steward of a living system. Recurring images (seed, brook’s flow, storm‑born hush) shift meaning by the end, reweighting “safeguard” from control to co‑evolution. A slight whiff of articulation in the final sentence edges toward meta, but remains earned by scene work. The pollinator exit image extends resonance beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: grief becomes tending absence into a shape sound can carry; the piece earns its resonance through image and action (blower‑lullaby, tunnel echo, wife’s chuckle). The explicit thesis line (“tending to the unspoken…”) slightly over‑states meaning near the end, trimming subtlety. Even so, the final images provide a non‑literal answer that lingers without sentimentality. Recurring objects (hourglass/cord) reprice the premise convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete motifs—waiting as attendance, interiorizing exteriors, homesickness reframed as arrival—without relying on expository moralizing. The final light “that had forgotten it was light” reweights the central concept with poignancy. A couple of lines skate close to thesis‑statement (“To make friends with uncertainty…”), but the surrounding scene work earns them. Resonance lingers via the boundary/membrane imagery tied to cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic weave of creative destruction, faith as frequency, and the calculus of change is rich and earned through images and acts. The crozier’s transformation and the nexus sealing reweight earlier motifs with resonance. Slight deduction for explicit thesising (“nothing whole stays holy”) that edges toward stated moral where implication already suffices. Still, the final cadence achieves a resonant conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonance blooms from particulars (star fragment, hush, coil), and the cocoon reframing lands as earned insight rather than a grafted thesis. The final image reanswers the opening question about endings with a non‑literal cadence (“needle finding the groove”). Slight thematic overstatement appears in aphoristic lines (“every quiet is merely rehearsal, every finale a hinge”), which edges toward telling. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of transience, refusal, and earned wholeness are carried through recurring images (sideways clocks, hourglass, horizon) without moralizing. The final stance (“permanent transient life he chose”) reweights earlier material into an earned paradox. Subtext around grief (mother’s laughter in a different decade) deepens motive without overstatement. The brass caps as relics of saved possibilities deliver a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—connection’s texture and the seen/unseen threads—earned by concrete recurrences (thread, gallery, dissolution). Yet explicit thesis lines (“Connection has texture”; “the weight of being witnessed”) flatten subtext, especially in the final paragraph. The piece shines when it lets images carry meaning; when it tells, resonance thins. Strong motifs; slightly moralizing finish.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of fear vs. direction, learning as survival, and reconfigured horizons resonate through the chain link’s evolving meaning and the final transfer. Subtext works well in images (the city dimming, the navigable void) and the refusal to lie. However, the closing aphorism (“direction begins where fear ends”) leans toward explicit moralizing, softening the otherwise organic resonance. Still, the conceptual repricing of “absence” salvages depth.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of listening, promise, and the ethics of attention accrue through particulars (Geiger‑like pulses, memorial names, “closing parentheses”). A single line leans close to thesis (“incidental heroism...”), but the carousel and synchronized aids carry the resonance without moralizing. The ending offers a non‑literal answer: presence can repair what grand gestures could not. Ambiguity remains humane rather than muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of remembrance as reanimation accrues through particular acts (naming as anchor, regret riding cables) and culminates in a resonant reweighting of “currency and love letters” with the dead. Subtext hums in “crashing hush” and the tide’s held-breath cadence. The near‑thesis line (“to stand by the unremembered is not to anchor them in sorrow…”) edges toward explicitness, slightly softening the afterglow. Overall, insight feels earned by scene pressure and image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme integrates through concrete acts (defragging via ink, heartbeat tallies) that refract failure into a navigable corridor. The telescope/corridor reframing lands in the lived exchange with the clerk and in the charged final walk. A few lines state the thesis a shade too explicitly (“failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor”), edging toward didactic. The finale still resonates beyond a moral, with images bearing the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: translating touch into sound, body into archive, and sacrifice into communal voice. The heron/starlings grammar reprise reweights the opening, arguing for living language as migratory and embodied rather than inked. No sermonizing; the last lines deliver a resonant conceptual answer through image and consequence. Ambiguity remains purposeful (curse as price vs. covenant).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres—grief reweighted into levity, self as the sought cryptid—delivered through images (static, frost, buoyant sorrow) that reprice prior beats. However, the explicit line “The wraith was never separate from you…” over‑articulates the thesis near the end, dulling subtext. The final images still resonate, but moralizing trims the afterglow. The piece otherwise avoids sentimentality and earns its insight.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Breaking free” evolves from gardener’s molt to orchard’s exhale to a child’s seed, with the shell reweighted as memory‑map and then sacrifice. Subtext of beauty vs. mechanism stays in image and action, not thesis; the heartbeat motif becomes communal rather than individual. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (beauty propagates as rumor and seed). No sermonizing; ambiguity invites reread without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of institutional absence and enforced memory develops through concrete emblems (heron feather, blank ledgers, empty cart). The “linking absences” method elegantly marries form and meaning; the cabinets’ self‑extinguishing avoids sermonizing. The truncated last line undercuts the final resonant chord, though the prior image sequence still lands. Complexity holds without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as latent music, craft as love, performance versus witness. The halo’s function reconfigures the premise without sermonizing; the trapeze artist’s shadow co‑sings in a beautifully oblique redemption. The last images (glowing train; rails as staff) offer a resonant answer that lingers. No moral spelled out; complexity is carried by image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of stories as resonance between observer and observed accrues through particulars (page‑friction as analog memory, charged catalog number, nautilus room). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing; the lingering “tactile whisper” extends meaning beyond the scene. One line names the thesis directly, but it’s earned by scene work. Subtext ties guardianship to cost and time.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of longing, memory, and absence develop through recurring images (palette, horizon, shelves) and reprice at the end when “luminous absence” becomes communal voice. No moralizing; resonance arises from action and image, especially the paper boat checked out like a book. The piece invites reflection on what it means to remember what one never lived. Slight softness in articulated personal cost keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of fear’s self‑sealing vault, earned courage, and the transmissibility of hope accrue through motifs (ribbon/hair, first star, negative‑space map) and reweight at the end. The deer of light and glowing hoofprints avoid didacticism while offering a non‑literal answer to “What if?”. Occasional explicit phrasing (“mind’s first thought of peace”) edges toward abstraction but is offset by concrete images. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, habit, and curiosity are woven through recurring images (Pleiades, raincoat, orchard) and reweighted by the “offered not stolen” insight. Subtext often resides in action rather than commentary, which strengthens resonance. However, the line “curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home” states the thesis overtly in the final beat, tipping toward moralizing. The piece would benefit from trusting its images to carry that conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Resilience, mentorship through absence, and memory vs. forgetting are woven through objects and action rather than stated. Recurring images (backward walking, blade‑smile, pinned afternoon) reweight in the ending. The final annotation (“Resilience is walking backwards until the path agrees to follow you.”) functions as conceptual repricing without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of stewardship versus hoarding arises from acts, not sermonizing, and the “shuttle” realization reweights prior images. The final sapling/rooting-in-air offers a resonant answer: wonder survives by circulation. Emotional aftereffect is earned through particulars (tools, droplets, laughter crossing the gorge). A single near-explicit thematic phrase skirts didacticism but doesn’t undercut the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of silence, confession, and freedom vs perfection emerge through action and image, not sermon. Recurring motifs (hush, netted words, constellations) reprice themselves at the end as liberation rather than accumulation. The vow risks sentimentality but is earned by concrete losses and immediate release of the fox spirit. The piece invites reflection without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of empathetic listening over mastery emerges through particulars (silent reels, sound‑drinking spirals, the chapel‑like hush). The mentor’s axiom echoes but the epiphany is dramatized by the map’s reknitting and her revaluation of practice. The final after‑image (second heartbeat) invites reflection without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively: the henge’s rule resists exploitation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises from particulars—water‑breathing books, the physicist’s asymmetric equation, the globe’s reweighting—to argue that grief changes state rather than vanishes. Subtext in Fred’s minimal dialogue and Rumi’s line deepens without sermonizing. The explicit recorder line (“grief obeys conservation laws”) risks thesis‑speak, but it’s earned by the scientific frame and paid for in action. The final image sustains resonance beyond the statement.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of converting loneliness into communal signal emerges through concrete actions (graffiti encoding, moths, broadcast) rather than sermon. The final image (child reading “I am lonely too”) reweights the premise with quiet social cost and hope. A couple of explanatory lines (“Lyra understood then…”) skim the edge of over-clarity. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through action and image: joy smuggled into sorrow’s fortress, seeds and music reweighted at the end. The “UNFOLD” motif, the apricot tree, and the major chord scene braid subtext without moralizing. The final image reprices the premise—expansion over ascent—creating lingering resonance. No thesis is spoken; insight is earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Memory as weather and the ethics of preservation emerge organically from action; the “Tell them…” litany is not a thesis dump but a tactic that doubles as prayer and record. The ending reweights the premise (empty space remembers) through a concrete reconfiguration, avoiding moralizing. Recurring images (scratches, dusty starlight, spool) deepen resonance without dictating meaning. A hair more friction between myth and material reality could add complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of limitation as lens emerges organically through craft choices and the negative-space revelation. Recurring images (coin notches, sky, shelves holding breath) are reweighted at the end. A few overt formulations (“the guild’s greatest knowledge…”) flirt with moralizing, slightly reducing subtext. Still, the last absence-as-anchor point resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme integrates language, memory, and navigation into a coherent argument that stories light the way between isolation and community. Recurring images (murmurations/spirals, “light remembers its way home,” the dog‑ear) reweight at the end without sermonizing. The closing map of “Murmuration Passage” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the piece’s question. Slight neatness in the communal resolution keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Repair as forgiveness emerges organically through object work and choice, not moralizing; the final line reweights the entire premise. Recurring images (ticks, eclipse, key, mirrors) shift valence from control to acceptance. The workshop scene reframes grief into custodianship without sentimentality. Ambiguity remains where it should (what is lost to gain this rhythm), deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grief transmuted into communal agency (“brambled hope”) accrues through concrete acts; motifs reprice at the end (bell’s tone unbrambled, nebula as communal reservoir). The piece invites reflection on trust and belonging without sermonizing—mostly. The chalked aphorism “Ghost or gardener…” skews didactic, mildly flattening subtext at the brink of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of imperfect mercy, maternal stewardship across lifetimes, and the ethics of sacrifice arise from concrete images (cracked smile, bruised clock, nested breaths). The final repricing—choosing to become the mirror so others may sleep—lands without didacticism, though “imperfection was the only song worth singing” brushes the edge of explicit statement. Recurring motifs reweight meaning rather than decorate. The resonance lingers with credible ambiguity (cost vs. salvation).

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Duty without love, the economy of sacrifice, and the oxymoron of “graceless beauty” emerge through image and act, not declaration. The final cadence reweights the world: salvation for others is bought with her continued imprisonment and the spent seed. Subtext in mechanical rituals (birds folding like untaught prayers) enriches the moral texture. No moralizing; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of braiding/rewoven memory emerge organically via polymers, river hydrodynamics, and sound; the final communal “instrument” reweights prior images without didacticism. Subtext of guilt, belated care, and art as conduit is carried in action (heat‑triggered laughter) rather than told. A faint whiff of thesising arrives in the last sentence’s explicit “proof,” trimming the aura of restraint. Overall resonance remains strong and non‑binary.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of absence as currency, memory versus story, and beginnings as cuts are embodied through trade mechanics and environmental shifts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes the threshold, repricing authorship as self-erasure. A single on-the-nose line (“Stories begin where memory ends; I sell the scissors”) skates close to thesis-stating but is supported by scene work. Subtext hums in images (ledger-mirrors, white space humming) rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of transforming grief rather than erasing it emerges organically through cooking/memory metaphors and the coral’s reweighted glow. The final paragraphs edge toward explicit moralizing (“the best recipes weren’t about forgetting”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the reprise of sand, coral, and future bloom supplies resonance beyond assertion. The conceptual repricing of memory-as-ingredient is strong and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bridge as song is earned through repeated, concrete acts of translation and repair; the final roadway of resonance reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext about dissolving human/machine silos accrues through images (violins from augers; infants in belts) rather than thesis. One explicit aphorism (“a bridge is a song…”) skirts statement but is motivated by character and craft. The ending lingers with conceptual and emotional aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of labor’s stolen reveries, resurrection through technology, and the ethics of excavation emerge from concrete beats. The final charged poise—failure plus sketches and resolve—offers a non‑literal answer about persistence and cost without sermonizing. Recurring images (silver, mirror, helix) accrue meaning rather than illustrate a thesis. Ambiguity lingers productively (what will the resurrected machines mean for the dead dreams?).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory/forgetting, vigilance, and authorship coalesce through recurring images (spirals, violet light, living calculation) rather than moralizing. The final conceptual reweighting—becoming the space between things—recasts prior motifs. A line or two edges toward abstraction, but the resonance is earned from concrete beats. Thematic complexity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of empathy, memory, technology enmeshed with ecology arise organically through action, not statement. Recurring objects (insulator, cracks, copper) reweight meaning into communion rather than noise. The ending’s “conversation” reframes silence and sound without moralizing. Subtext—grief braided into restoration—lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Beauty through sacrifice and precise risk is thematically braided via chess pedagogy, political consequence, and the nexus patterns. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer (create beauty, don’t merely discover it), reweighting prior motifs. Occasional explicit thesis statements (“he finally understood…”) verge on didactic, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the imagery earns a contemplative afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Empathy as resonance emerges through concrete acts (tuning, naming silences, echoing the final hush) rather than thesis alone. Recurring images (safe/lock, radio, fireworks) reweight at the end with the mirror/poppy. A slight tendency to declare (“She would spend the rest of her nights teaching others…”) brushes sentimentality but doesn’t collapse subtext. The final exchange (“Thank you for hearing me home”) closes the theme without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: “What is hidden feeds what is revealed,” the family custom, and “serenity within motion” reconfigure by the end as she chooses companionate stillness over display. Recurring images (indigo paper, birds, breath, tide) shift meaning at closure without moralizing. The offering of the journal enacts the theme instead of stating it. Ambiguity (spirits vs. sensitivities) enriches without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story earns its thematic insight through image and event, culminating in resilience as a collective, transgenerational process. Subtext hums in the water’s “notation,” the arrow’s acceleration, and the echo‑archive. However, the explicit line “resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking” in the final exchange edges into stated thesis, slightly flattening the resonance. The rest resists tidy moralizing and sustains complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance emerges from the living-architecture premise, adaptation, and the charged patch, culminating in a reweighting of what cities can be. However, several lines verge on thesis-stating (“architecture could become alive,” “She would spend her remaining years…”), which blunts subtext. The best thematic work sits in images (nautilus spiral; vibrating patch as compass). The piece invites reflection but edges toward explicit moral at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—wonder vs. utility/ornament—emerges through action and image (sound carving hush; aurora nested in snowflakes) and is reweighted at the end. A touch of declarative statement (“Wonder, now unfettered…”) flirts with telling but the surrounding imagery keeps it earned. The final listening‑quiet and humming earth offer resonant repricing without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the crack/certification pairing.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme arises organically from particulars: echo vs. silence, drive vs. stillness, failure as a living process. Recurring images (driftwood, hush, seam, flute) shift meaning by the end to articulate unweaving as wisdom without moralizing. The mirror’s line (“admit the failure is still growing”) risks overt statement but works diegetically as a pressure device rather than a lecture. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers with integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: printing as empathy arithmetic, the halo’s light, and “we are the remainder.” The ending reweights the premise toward release over possession with a resonant image. A single line edges toward aphorism (“that to shine is to be alone together”) but remains earned by the pattern of actions. Subtext hums in the subtraction motif rather than being lectured.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (memory to myth; wonder coaxed from routine) emerges through recurrent images and the final reweighting. However, lines like “sometimes the courier must become the message” and the final paragraph’s explicit moralizing flatten subtext. Resonance is present, but some insight is told rather than earned in image/action. The ending’s image still carries aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action and image—objects as reliquaries, grief refracted into spectrum, “truthful lies” as ritual currency. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing (“Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush”). Subtext around proof vs pilgrimage and reliquary vs prison is earned by particulars. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Silence as currency, memory as distance, and craft as bridge cohere through recurring particulars (swallow-shaped void, ant wing, sap). The final stasis reweights prior images into a map of sacrifice without moralizing. The petal and seasonal rewinding complicate loss with restorative consequence, sustaining ambiguity that invites reflection. Subtext hums in gesture rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of resilience from rubble, unmaking weight, and awakening are embedded in concrete acts and objects. Recurring images (silk, hammer/pick, arches) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The “bartered awakenings” concept gains ethical weight when he demands their return “with interest.” The final tonal naming risks neatness but harmonizes with the reconfigured world.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of truth as mass and the ethics of cartography emerges through images and actions rather than lecture; the note risks aphorism but is embedded as artifact and reweighted by the ending vow. Recurring motifs (shard’s song, redirection, loom) evolve in meaning and culminate coherently. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection on complicity and weaponized knowledge. No false equivalence dilutes the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Memory versus oblivion, witnessing as a form of protection, and anonymous intimacy emerge from concrete acts (stones as letters, bottling safety). The final repricing—light as witnessed absence rather than illumination—reweights the whole piece. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the charged objects. The child’s skiff and widow’s cove thread ethical grief into the present without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from images of obsolete print, inverted light/shadow physics, and authorship shifting from paper to sky. The prophetic lines risk aphorism but are integrated as consequences of her laugh rather than authorial intrusion. The final reconfiguration—reader not herald; presses of light on a planetary retina—reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers productively without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: story as exchange, bodies as vessels, and hollows that invite narratives. Recurring images (wing, sun trails, thread) shift meaning by the end, with the wing becoming a lamp to guide future travelers. One explicit thesis line (“He understood then why…”) slightly reduces subtextual power, but the surrounding images do the heavy lifting. The aftereffect is tender and reflective without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of witnessing vs. quantifying, ecological grief, and repair arise organically through events and images (numbered leaves; sorrow measured in “rings”). The final reweighting—“quantify nothing”—is potent, though the phrasing flirts with explicit thesis. Subtext hums in the pin as a “bookmark” and in the cedar’s future cones as second chances. Emotional aftereffect is earned without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of interdependence and communal memory emerges organically through the act of singing one another’s verses and the mirror’s refusal to reflect others’ light. The recurring objects/images (mica, woven dawns, tarry scab) reweight meaning at the end. One line states thesis a bit baldly (“Understanding bloomed…”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of absence as presence and wisdom born of flaw are earned through images and action (the invitation “drinking” her, Vale bowing to absence). Subtext hums in paradoxes and hush motifs. However, the final sentence states the moral overtly, slightly flattening resonance. Without that explicitness, the ending’s conceptual repricing would be even stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece articulates a rich theme—sacred in the ordinary; absolution as cultivation—through concrete acts with evolving meaning (bread → seedlings → mosaics → reopened bell). Subtext hums in the gardener’s line (“Guilt rises like yeast; plant it”) and in the commuters’ half-noticing. The ending’s conceptual repricing is earned and lingers without moralizing. One line (“bread is daily resurrection”) edges toward statement but remains grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—measurement vs. meaning, memory vs. oblivion—emerges through objects and acts rather than exposition, with a reweighted final stance. The vow “Meaning endures where measurement fails” risks explicitness, but its diegetic status and her counter‑inscription keep it earned. The closing reclassification to “Possibility—unmeasured” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity lingers productively in the cost of stepping away from the archive’s ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Trust, silence, and commodified feeling braid through concrete events; the truce of hush is both rule and theme. The final “small wet click” and her lighter emptiness provide a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Motifs (mermaid fob, dawn, hush) return reweighted at the end. Ambiguity is purposeful (her father’s absence) and deepens the question.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—individuals “carrying weather” as communal emotional labor—emerges from concrete images and culminates in a reweighted mission. Subtext runs through taste, scent, and the forest “elections” rather than moralizing, though one line (“They were elected by the world itself”) edges toward explicit statement. The final reframe (map people, not storms) resonates and lingers. Complexity is maintained without false binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of memory, inheritance, and reframed vocation emerge through particulars (lock dates, laughter refracted, crystals embodying lines). The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing; her new practice (blank sheets) enacts the answer rather than states it. One explicit thesis‑like line about callings appears but is supported by concrete struggle. The subtle shift from “auroral sorrow” to “auroral becoming” is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—candor preserved through unsent, intimate communication—emerges organically via the mother’s letters and the greenhouse’s tests. The line “the map had not led her to a place but to a practice” edges toward explicitness but is earned by particulars (tears absorbed by ink, the lily sigil). Subtext about drought-of-truth vs. water drought is deftly braided. The truncated ending blunts the lingering resonance a complete charged image would provide.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Images and actions earn a resonant answer: wonder as frequency enacted through a silent symphony and communal transmission (the wedge to the boy). Subtext thrives in silence-as-resonator and material sacrifice; emotional afterglow is concrete. A few lines verge on thesis (“wonder is not a feeling but a frequency”), trimming subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant motifs (roses, fire, seed, memory) integrate with the idea that resolution transforms rather than erases fear. However, the closing line explicitly states the moral about nostalgia, blunting subtext in the final paragraph. Prior images already earned the insight; stating it reduces lingering ambiguity. Thematic core is strong but marred by that overt articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: objects “return to stories,” listening as treatment, community as ear. Subtext operates via hush, heartbeat, and offerings—no didactic summary. The final image conceptually reprices knowledge vs. witness without sermonizing, though the closing aphorism brushes the edge. Resonance lingers beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: “vulnerability is not the lock, it is the hinge” shifts from decoded content to embodied tactic to communal effect. Calm defiance is enacted rather than preached—Mara surrenders to the current and swallows the cipher, then the lullaby liberates a child. The final constellation‑like code reprices fear and strength without moralizing. Images carry subtext across beats (dice as fate/choice, web as time/fragility).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of memory as mass, grief as altered gravity, and absence as presence accrue through particulars rather than thesis. The realization that deleted memories migrate reweights the world and Mael’s vocation; the final image (lamps as buoys) answers the core question without moralizing. Subtext hums through images (coffee grounds as absences, wildflowers resurrected then spent) and invites reflection beyond plot. Ambiguity feels chosen, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silence as mastery (not absence) is enacted through concrete acts and the closing cost image lingers. Recurring motifs (crane, brook, code vs. hush) accrue subtext without over‑explanation. One explicit thematic sentence (“tranquility is not the absence of fire but the mastery of its blaze”) risks mild moralizing in the final third, slightly flattening the resonance. Even so, the piece invites reflection and resists tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    “Agreed upon lies,” memory vs. erasure, and care‑as‑translation braid through concrete acts (borrowing sugar, the mislabeled thermos, the seal imprint). The concluding “stay” reframes comfort as complicity, a conceptual repricing that lingers. No sermonizing; insights arise from particulars (future perfect of walls, gargoyle’s accent). The Mrs. Chen beat widens the theme without diffusion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of memory, ownership, and communal inheritance surface through concrete images (flowers carrying copies; commuters humming). The final repricing—“some ghosts are futures”—lands without sermonizing and reweights the premise. Minor abstraction appears (“translate isolation into independence”), but it’s backed by on‑page cost and action. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (thorn, key, writing) evolve to reframe justice and forgiveness; the final reweighting (“key” as heart’s prison) resonates. Some theme lines state the thesis a bit directly (“we are all incomplete stories”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the closing images and renunciation deliver a felt aftereffect. The piece avoids false equivalence and honors moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of endings versus reverberations emerges organically through echoes, moths, and the act of finishing. The line “I echoed because I never finished leaving” is diegetic but edges on overt statement; the later “progressive disclosure of goodbye” flirts with a spelled‑out thesis. Still, the final image reweights the premise without sermonizing. Resonance lingers via the portable ending motif (the fused shell).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—wreckage cradling light, communal memory leaking between souls—emerges through actions and objects rather than statement, with the snow globes’ reweighted meaning at the end. Subtext in the “cameo” dream-roles coheres as a tapestry when faces find peace. The final charged poise—leaving the mirror, carrying knowledge forward—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Any explicitness (“knowledge that even wreckage can cradle light”) remains anchored in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete labor, pattern‑making, and the ethics of maintenance; the closing descent reframes understanding as praxis. Recurring motifs (nets, whisk, moon paths) accrue meaning. A couple lines verge on thesis statement (“understanding comes not from seeing but from doing”), trimming subtlety. Resonance still lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of institutional deceit, memory as curse, and truth’s corrosive necessity surface through concrete action, not thesis. The orchard’s false vitality vs. accelerated rot crystallizes the moral calculus without sermonizing. The “conscience flaw” reinterprets the diamond and Marisol’s past role, yielding a conceptual repricing. The final seeds/rot image invites reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of memory’s necessary shadows versus purist light emerges through images and acts, not just assertion; “what’s left when the light forgets to be honest” elegantly reframes the premise. Subtext deepens as the prophet’s private doubt leaks, complicating villainy. A few lines skate near thesis (explicit moral stakes), but the ending’s image-led repricing predominates. The clipped final sentence slightly blurs the afterglow but maintains charge.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: pennies as invitations, jars as ethical memory practice, and a final shift from individual curation to communal chord. Subtextual currents (economy of memory, refugee inheritance, gift vs. sale) layer without sermonizing. The projected line borders on on‑the‑nose but remains earned by the ritualized action. The last image recasts the personal mission as a collective act without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of mercy through attention and engineered empathy is earned by acts, not told. The story reframes power as resonance and consent (“teaching darkness to listen”), avoiding moralizing. Recurring images (spiral, key, ice/whale memory) deepen meaning and shift at the end to a map of absolution. Ambiguity lingers productively in the cost of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—patience as sculpted craft in service of revolution—emerges organically from action and motif. “Restrained wildness” culminates in the blue sparks that honor boundary, reweighting power and responsibility. No moralizing; resonance lingers through the cost of attention and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong thematic braid: memory, control, complicity, and liberation refracted through the lantern and drought logistics. “The water remembers” reweights guilt and systems of power. A line near the end states the thesis outright (“didn’t require death, only the courage to speak the truth”), softening subtext. Despite that, the last image reframes the lantern’s purpose with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of mercy, second opinions, and earned consequence arise from concrete acts (mechanical repair as moral practice, evidence delivery, candle fund sacrifice). The “contrition without consequence is merely nostalgia” line flirts with didacticism but is grounded by ensuing action. The final music/light synthesis reframes time and justice without a tidy moral. Subtext operates in the analogies between heart, mechanism, and institution.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around translation, yearning, and irreverent devotion to impossible tasks. The final chord that “tasted of copper and ozone” reframes the Algorithm as music, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. No moralizing intrudes; the piece invites reflection on technology as desire made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Memory, erasure, and commodified grief accrue through concrete images (ghost posts, unsent messages, chorus leaking to the net). The lullaby motif deepens from private inheritance to public reckoning, reweighting the premise at the end. One explicit sentence (“auctioned the grief-clicks”) flirts with didactic clarity but the surrounding images preserve resonance. The final charged poise resists tidy moralizing while making cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of transforming empathy into action is dramatized through specific acts (reconstituting possibility, using mirrors to map and move). Recurring images (mirrors, maps, light) accrue meaning and shift at the end (“net…like a treaty”). One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“to map empathy onto action”), slightly reducing subtlety. The final tableau carries earned resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: patience reframed as a hinge, grief as teacher, listening over spectacle, and solace as a communal, windborne practice. The parasol tip and horn return reweighted, offering a non‑literal answer to the central question. No moralizing; the aphoristic line about umbrellas stays character‑true. The final cadence lingers with earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematically rich—mismatch → transformation, struggle → expression, staying as bravery—and the returning images (letter, pavilion, ’98) shift meaning at the end. Yet several declarative theme statements (“destined mismatches weren’t failures,” “intersubjective understanding…”) edge into moralizing and reduce subtext. The best moments embody theme in particulars (sector seven Cabernet, stress pruning) without saying it. The truncated ending also slightly dulls the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of silence, respectful distance, and pre‑verbal understanding are dramatized through the method (peripheral awareness) rather than told. The prophet’s line risks thesis‑statement, but it’s early and then embodied by action; the ending reweights it with the charged poise of a preserved echo awaiting the “quiet enough.” Resonance lingers without moralizing. Complexity comes from refusing direct apprehension as the path to truth.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of collective healing through art emerges organically from particulars and culminates in the town’s exhale; strong subtext in rust/bloom, key/heart, dove/flight. A mid-piece line explicitly names the thesis (“collective healing begins…”), which slightly blunts subtlety. The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Resonance lingers via the communal witness and the charged objects.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: endings as beginnings, language’s death opening a chorus of memory, growth as inward spiral. Recurring images (crystal, hush, snowdrop, last dictionary/“zygote”) evolve in meaning and culminate without moralizing. The final smile reads as earned repricing rather than tidy moral. Subtext breathes in implication and image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of impermanence and memory’s decay emerges through concrete acts (garbage‑yard relics, chalk, tape, fog) rather than lecture. The late realization slightly edges toward articulation (“he was becoming it”), but it’s supported by earned particulars. Recurring images (driftwood, oxide, spirals) deepen the meditation without tidy moralizing. The piece invites reflection beyond the scene’s surface.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of impermanence, capture vs. release, and time as aperture emerge through concrete images that shift meaning at the end (leaf-sound, observatory-as-camera, the photograph containing lost futures). The aphoristic refrain risks overtness but is earned by the tactile particulars and the mentor’s earlier warning. The final repricing—she was the subject being developed—lingers without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is strong and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of parting, ritual care, and the difference between reunion and repair arise organically from images and acts, not sermonizing. The recurring vinyl motif evolves meaningfully, culminating in a nuanced answer to the central question of how to say goodbye. Subtext in dialogue (“Goodbyes aren’t endings”) avoids platitude by being enacted. The final image reweights prior details with lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of absence/return and “sealed awakenings” is earned through concrete actions and reweighted images (shadow as self, love bent by light). The final exchange at the sundial reframes absence as a teachable geometry, not mere loss. The closing aphoristic line (“every shadow is only love bent…”) edges toward explicit moralizing, softening the otherwise impeccable subtext. Even so, resonance lingers through the cost and the charged stillness of the restored noon.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, utility of lies, and strength at the “angle of wounding” emerge through concrete images and charged objects rather than didactic summary. The final constellation/jaw set reweights the premise and offers a non‑literal answer. One line of overt thesis from the changeling (“every mistake is a seed…”) flirts with moralization, but the piece otherwise trusts image and action. Ambiguity remains meaningful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme (“quiet light,” fear vs. gentleness, inheritance across generations) emerges through objects and acts (sea glass, quilting star maps, sparkler circle) rather than stated morals. The final repricing—“weighing nothing, lighting everything”—reweights prior images with resonance. Subtext about communal fear and non‑combustive illumination is vivid without sermonizing. Epiphany feels earned via ritual and release, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through actioned images: seeds, circuits gone quiet, and cadence of drip reframing trauma into growth. The pendant/ant motif reweights patience and scale, avoiding moralizing while landing an earned, resonant answer. Subtext in “the next sentence the world had not yet earned” and the burial choice resists platitude. The final image conceptually reprices virality and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (sea, shell, mist, tide) build a coherent meditation on artistic responsibility and the ethics of hope. Subtext plays through images—the refugee boy, the unresolved chord—without sermonizing most of the way. One explicit thematic line (“collecting hopes was not hoarding but releasing them”) edges toward moral statement, slightly dampening the earned resonance. The final lighthouse image restores nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of ancestral knowledge vs. industrial amnesia arise organically from ritual action and mnemonic biology. However, the explicit statement “sacred practices weren’t primitive superstitions but sophisticated systems” veers into moralizing and blunts subtext. The final image (valley voices remembering) already carried the resonance. Strong imagery supports theme, but the thesis line reduces ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Patience, memory-as-fuel, and the ethics of mapping (war vs. living heart) braid into a meditation on agency and cost without sermonizing. Recurring images (paper, fruit/orchard, bowl, plate) reweigh meaning at the near‑end when relinquishment is named. The conceptual reframing is strong but lacks the final performed price to fully resonate. Still, the synthesis feels earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around the ethics of wonder vs. control, memory’s thinning returns, and the labor of making time obedient. Recurring images (reflections, echoes paying a toll, the blank silver plate) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The spoken line about “storing wonder” risks on‑nose but is earned and then dramatized by the locked cellar choice. The final orchard‑echo image expands the inquiry beyond plot into elegiac aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonance is strong: burdens transformed into threads, reciprocity of sorrow and release, and the necessity of risking one’s own wound. The final reweighting—leaving the lamp and carrying only “memory of their weight”—lingers. However, the last sentence states the lesson explicitly, dulling subtext in the closing breath. Without that moralizing clause, this would sit in the 8.8–9.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and acts: cages, latches, commands, jars, and carving synthesize grief as management of danger and love. The final realization avoids moralizing, offering a nuanced reweighting: memory as both prison and liberation. Recurrences (“here and gone,” “wait, watch, come”) shift meaning by the end. A hair more friction around the ethical cost of “opening” would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of regret, memory-as-currency, and ambition’s erosion arise organically from the trades. Images reweight at the end (blank → mirror; carousel repaired “by ambition it never earned”), offering a resonant, non-literal answer about survival’s costs. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers as the “new-me” departs with the tool. The emotional aftereffect is cold and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hope as redirected flow is dramatized through concrete acts; the final image reinterprets departure gates as arrival gates. The sextant’s transfer to a child and “datum zero” elegantly reframes the math as communal. A slight tendency to state the thesis (“if hope equals flow…”) trims subtlety, but resonance remains strong. The piece earns reflection through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Images earn a resonant stance on time, ambition, and acceptance; the bear/seed/tree reweight the premise with real cost. However, the explicit thesis line (“peace is not the absence of dreams…”) edges into thematic tell, dulling subtext in the final paragraph. Most insights arise from action and image rather than commentary. The piece otherwise resists platitude and invites re‑reading.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of institutional forgetting, inherited scaffolds of lies, and public monuments accrue through concrete acts (decoding, salvage, renunciation) rather than sermonizing. “Serene upheaval” shifts from internal sensation to environmental image to civic project, reweighting prior beats. One line edges toward explicit thesis, but resonance remains earned. The final mission reframes truth as ongoing work with social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of living heritage versus curation, language encoded in craft, and ocean as memory emerge through concrete acts and a reweighted final image. The rope‑as‑text motif evolves into action and cost. One explicit line (“Heritage is a seed, not a glass case”) edges toward thesis, but the piece otherwise trusts subtext. The ending invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The motifs (thread, leaves, portals) evolve into a resonant answer about presence within absence. However, several explicit thesis lines (“about the lonesome splendor of choosing one’s own ending,” “courage to be witnessed”) overstate what the images already earn, edging into moralizing. Subtext otherwise operates well in the reconfigured memories. The ending image reweights prior material convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: creation-as-reversal, beauty versus mechanism, and the ethics of resurrection, all earned through actions and images. The “flawed genesis” motif gains weight at the end, revaluing failure as necessary birth. Subtext hums in the shy, uncageable ribbon and the crown unknitting into leaves. A couple aphoristic lines flirt with explicitness but remain character‑voiced and image‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of transmutation, inheritance, and reconciliation arise through concrete acts and images (charcoal vein, red thread, “song scars might sing”). The final promise reweights the premise without moralizing, though one or two lines edge toward thesis-y articulation. The Icarus echo broadens without hijacking the scene. Emotional aftereffect is honest and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of release versus inheritance of abandonment emerges organically through fountains and the box; the ending reweights prior images without moralizing. The line “The memories did not ask for forgiveness—they asked only to be seen” flirts with explicit statement but is supported by concrete beats. The geese resuming flight crystallizes a non-literal answer about time and letting go. Resonance lingers without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: transmission vs. rootedness, memory without burning, patterns that can be broken by becoming the wave. Recurring images (gear/ratio, petals, echo) shift meaning at the end without sermonizing. The grandmother’s line reprises with altered weight, offering an earned, non‑literal answer. A hair of explicitness in the final aphorism keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—collective grief acquiring a transmissible shape—emerges organically from craft actions, mentorship terms, and the spiral’s social afterlife. Recurring motifs (poems, butterflies, spiral) reweight meaning without sermonizing; “What flies away returns as sky” resonates as earned wisdom. The piece avoids platitudes by binding insight to specific acts and costs. Minor risk of over-explicit aphorism is mitigated by strong image‑driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—forgiveness as shared balance rather than unilateral absolution—emerges through concrete acts (carving the missing “r,” making the apology the clock’s mass). The for-give metronome risks on-the-nose but works as embodied subtext that reweights debt/time ethics without sermonizing. The final images (seed buckets, lowered tone, corrosion) offer a resonant answer that complicates simple moral victory. Ambiguity remains about long-term cost, deepening aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant motifs—memory vs hours, gardening as stewardship, and the spiral—cohere into a meditation on tending the past. The final role acceptance reweights the premise without a didactic moral. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The living wager hours, the dead wager memory”; labeled seed packets) which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the images carry genuine emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of ignorance as deliberate clearing arises from concrete actions and costs, not just assertion. Recurring images (feather, door opening inward, equations skated upon) shift meaning at the end to deliver a conceptual repricing. One line borders on aphoristic declaration (“This is not the future…”), slightly expository, but the surrounding imagery sustains resonance. The ending invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of art as encoded resistance emerges organically from actions (intervals for emotions, rosin ink, dust speaking). The ending offers a resonant answer: stories persist by inhabiting matter and bodies, even enemies’. No sermonizing; the inspectors’ involuntary “paragraphs” in their eyes embodies repricing. Recurring images (mist, embers, dust) gain new charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres through recurring images (mask shards, powder, rocking) and culminates in a resonant final tableau. However, explicit thesis lines (“safety is always a mirage…”) in the last paragraph constitute thematic echo/moralizing that undercuts subtext. The rest of the piece earns complexity through particulars and implication. Strong resonance despite on‑the‑nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of competing narratives and honest clocks emerges from concrete acts—diving, ledgers, strata, counter‑clock inscription—rather than abstractions alone. The final image reweights earlier motifs (time as gear; sea as rinsing truth) with a resonant stance. However, the closing aphorism edges into explicit moralizing, slightly reducing subtextual charge. Earlier superb images (census parchment bleeding faces into numbers) carry the thesis more powerfully than the spelled‑out line.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through image and act: harmony by subtraction; vanishing arts as latent negative space; silence as root tone. The final repricing—quiet becoming the city’s fundamental—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Lines like “vanishing arts do not disappear; they wait inside negative space” feel earned by the scene’s mechanics. Resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory as commons, beauty as an offshoot of decay, and cuisine as political instrument emerge through concrete acts (ash of cookbooks, “synaptic plasticity” aromas). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: officers depart altered, pockets seeded. Recurring images (rust, pruning, fruit) accrue meaning and pivot at closure. Ambiguity lingers productively around ethics and contagion of nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of wonder preserved through transgressive honesty (a lie that keeps you honest) emerges organically from constraint and action. Recurring images (nectar dusk, bees, coins) shift meaning at the end. The final offered matchbox extends the ethical paradox into the world. The last clause edges toward explicitness but stays earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of loneliness, ritual, hospitality, and ethical witness emerge through particulars (iron taste of “vanished birthdays,” covenant shard). The final image reprices the premise: a world “learning to feel its own edges” invites care without possession. No moral is stated; meaning accrues in image and action with lingering ambiguity (what if the city asks to be held?). The violets/“hush” motif evolves from tool to ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Nuance versus certainty is dramatized through foxglove’s duality and the porous stone taking memory “like an apology.” Recurring images (poison/remedy, door/breath in “welcome”) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. Subtext runs through contradictions—statues remembering, the city “alive, though it remembers death with fondness.” A single aphoristic line (“Revelation is not a hammer...”) skirts explicitness but is earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Regret as recursion and “texture” coheres with the math/dice/stair motifs, culminating in a non‑literal answer: she reweights opportunity by marking and renouncing. Subtext operates through objects and pattern breaks rather than thesis statements, with only minor moments of explicitness (“probability was a liar”). The door‑never‑seen reframes the quest without moralizing. The final forgetting image lingers as a complex, earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    Memory, kindness, and language intertwine through images rather than moralizing; “coins warm from palms that still remembered giving” and the sandwich reflection embody the thesis. The ending reweights earlier images (breath/marigold/indigo) into a communal ethic without dictating a lesson. Subtext runs through action (breathing the mural) and quiet reciprocity (marigolds on windshields). Ambiguity lingers productively about how far the city can change.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of preservation-as-resonance and community memory in hands accrue through bread, bees, lens, and lute. The thesis line (“Art is not displacement...”) approaches moralizing but is buttressed by vivid enactment (honey on stone, harmonized waterfall). Subtext of utility vs beauty operates via council metrics vs embodied craft. The last images sustain a contemplative aftereffect without neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of fate versus agency and the cost of possibility emerges organically through the counterclockwise vs clockwise motif and the hunger stone’s “latent radiance” burning out. The final image reweights everything: a simple forward clock that tells “the promise that any hour could still be changed.” One line edges toward explanatory (“he understood that by reverse-engineering...”), but it’s supported by on‑page action. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around fear as self, reflection, and forgiveness; images do the heavy lifting (the gray child; mirrors to salt). The final realization reweights prior material without neat moralizing, though “just mirrors arranged…” edges close to articulation. The paradox “The thing that kills you is already saved” operates subtextually through action, not sermon. Resonance lingers in the last walk into dawn with self‑owned luminance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece articulates a rich theme—art as instrument, community rhythm transforming obstacle—through concrete acts rather than thesis. Recurring images (lyre → nautilus; petals as notation) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer: silence can be converted into motion when reframed as groove. Ambiguity remains purposeful, with no tidy platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Duty vs wandering, inheritance, and the ethics of enclosure surface through images and decisions, not moralizing. The final repricing (“to keep the city’s children from following”) reweights prior ritual and silence with poignant cost. Motifs (patterns, shells, cracks) accrue meaning and resolve in a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection on chosen limits and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—beauty weaponized to sanctify suffering versus a slower, plainer truth—emerges through object, setting, and action, not just assertion. The illuminated “A” and rail imagery reweight at the end (“truth, though slower, traveled farther than noble lies”), with the rosebush’s edit motif tightening the close. A few lines tilt toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. Still, the images carry the argument with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: absence as presence, preservation versus loss, the ethics of recording versus mourning. Recurring images (ink, fissures, keystone void, drawbridge) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final understanding—that separations are “foundations” needing care—feels earned by action. Ambiguity lingers productively about legacy and discovery of her notes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of institutional erasure versus memory accrues through particulars (bruised cards, negative‑space map) and culminates in a reclassification to remember. The subtextual idea that archives are instruments of governance, not neutrality, is dramatized rather than declared. One aphoristic closing clause skirts moralizing but is anchored to the stamp’s image, keeping it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of grief-as-craft and luminous burden transmuted into communal light emerges organically from particulars. Motifs (lamps, chimneys, leaves, cranes) reweight at the end without moralizing, offering a charged refusal rather than cure. The final act—smoke that neither ascends nor descends—answers the central question with quiet, earned ambiguity. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through material, practiced actions.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: harvesting possibility as a commodified grief, the ethics of perturbation, and choosing whose harm is borne. The crystal’s evolution from gift to weapon drives the moral repricing. A line or two edges toward thesis articulation, but the ending’s image does the heavy lifting without sermonizing. Resonance lingers in the wedding-flute dust motif.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (frequencies, stars, printing) braid into a theme of calling and homecoming, with the final image reweighting prior mentions of the grandmother and parents. The line “It prints belonging” leans overt, but the lever action and sonic revelation earn the realization. The piece invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, fabrication, and atonement emerge from concrete acts rather than thesis. The “sieved hush” shifts meaning—from numbing residue to a coarse, graspable weight—reframing guilt’s texture at the end. The ocean’s “tempered sigh” refuses absolution, resisting tidy moralizing. One line (“arithmetic of guilt”) edges toward stating theme but is redeemed by the tactile shell/void image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of mercy, memory, and neutrality emerge through objects and action; the rope, moon cycles, and the pull reweight meaning at the end. Subtext in gestures (offering gloves, guards averting eyes) carries moral texture. The final paragraph edges into overt statement (“forge,” “rings like iron”), slightly diluting earned resonance. Still, the conceptual repricing of forgiveness lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—how to align heart and action when instruments fail—emerges through action, not moralizing. Recurring images (poles as constellations, “latitude by longing, longitude by loss,” the compass’s failure) reweight meaning at the end. The “recalibration” insight is earned by scene pressure, not handed down. The final “widening yes” answers the central question without closing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, culpability, and redemption are embodied in concrete acts (immersion, letters, communal “circuit”). Recurring motifs (baseball, obits, stitches/maps) evolve meaningfully at the end. Two aphoristic thesis statements (“Empathy isn’t kindness…,” “redemption isn’t a doorway…”) risk overtness but are supported by scene pressure. The final loop with the time traveler conceptually reprices the whole narrative without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of love-as-forge, death/rebirth, and identity braid through recurring objects (fortune, bowl, spices) and reprice at the end. Subtext operates in images (beak singing a lullaby backwards) rather than sermonizing. A slight risk of near-explicit theme captioning via the fortune lines is mitigated by the concrete cost and image-led closure. The emergent answer—coexistence over erasure—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, time’s condensation, and maternal love recur via specific objects and rituals, reweighted by the ending. Subtext operates through the tea, tracing, and cloud repentance rather than overt explication. A few lines tilt toward thesis‑statement clarity (“showing every grieving parent how to unfasten grief without forgetting love”), slightly reducing the austerity of the resonance. Overall, the afterimage is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mercy as mirror, grief integrated into forged joy, and “shadow work” recur through concrete acts (photo‑sail, fusion with the Tear). The closing image reweights the premise with a humane answer. A touch of overt moralizing (“lantern rather than a final bomb”) trims subtlety in the last paragraph, though the image itself remains strong. Subtext is otherwise embedded in gesture and object.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of transformation-through-surrender resonates through image chains and the reweighted identity at the end. However, explicit thesis lines (“transformation requires surrender,” “what is destitution but…”) edge toward moralizing, reducing subtext. The final image still lingers with conceptual richness. Greater reliance on image over assertion would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of light versus imposed “ink,” obedience turning to invention, accrues through specific objects and actions, culminating in the charged dawn. Subtext often lives in gesture (the mask drop, the waltzing gears) and the reweighted fort. However, “Tell the ministry that their ink has dried; we write tomorrow with light” edges into thesis articulation and slightly flattens the resonance. Even so, the final image largely earns its aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Patterns, promise, and surrender braid into a clear thematic chord; the eel dissolving into light reframes “understanding” as presence. Mira’s death as “her final pattern” elegantly reprices the premise. However, the closing aphorism (“Some promises are meant to be broken by understanding”) edges into stated thesis, dulling subtext. The piece still lingers with earned ambiguity despite that overt line.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance is strong: scars revalued as cartography and belonging; bureaucracy of silence counterpointed by a personal counter‑archive. However, the line “When masks slip we do not become faces, we become weather” states thesis overtly in the final third, slightly flattening subtext. Most meaning otherwise arises from image and action rather than instruction. Aftertaste remains potent despite the small didactic note.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—questions as destinations, listening as motion—emerges through image and action rather than moralizing. Recurring motifs (sundial, card, brook, overture) reweight at the end to answer the opening query non‑literally. Dialogue carries subtext (the harbor invitation) with earned resonance. Complexity remains without false binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through deed: composting old selves, rebuilding shelves into a spiral, seeding dictionaries with cranes—beauty from anarchy enacted, not preached. Subtext in status inversions (CO aiding an inmate; order used to shelter rebellion) complicates the moral calculus. A few explicit lines (“Beauty from anarchy”) flirt with on‑the‑nose but are earned by the concrete ritual. The final identity inscription reframes earlier images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme braided through particulars: time’s betrayal, art as rehearsal versus living, choice as composition. The clock, compasses, and unresolved chord recur and reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The line “the film was not escape but rehearsal” risks explicitness but is earned by scene pressure and pays off in the final act. The last chime offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—uncertainty as binding force and the ethics of collective memory—is organically embedded in action and image (silver leaf’s instruction, children chanting questions). The conceptual repricing at the end is strong, but the final sentence edges into explicit thesis (“cultural memory survives not because it is true...”), which slightly blunts resonance. Despite that, the imagery-driven argument mostly avoids sermonizing elsewhere. The cost of knowledge as loss deepens the theme credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres through concrete motifs—pruning, navigation, color—as the ending reweights “severance” into a pruning that preserves memory. Subtext runs through action and image (banner of surrender; roots tasting metal) rather than thesis. One explicit articulation (“severance had never been exile…”) edges toward statement but is earned by prior particulars. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration is the story’s greatest strength. The core concept of gradual change operating at vastly different scales is woven into every sentence, from the "slow heartbeats of collapsed suns" to the "metamorphic weeks" of a caterpillar. The theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of the neutron star and the butterfly dust, avoiding any didacticism. The final line is a resonant, non-literal conclusion that solidifies the story's complex ideas about decay, data, and meaning without ever stating a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of finding meaning in stillness ("purpose in the pauses") is developed with remarkable coherence and subtlety. It emerges organically from recurring motifs—glass, breath, frost, resonance—without ever being stated as a moral. The final image of the artist ready to shape "transparency without secrets" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting the entire narrative beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of translation—of loss into art, silence into music, and data into emotion—is seamlessly integrated. The final image of the child's breath as a treble clef provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The thematic resonance is profound and lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, duty, and the nature of rest without resorting to didacticism. The central metaphor of a library for souls is sustained with incredible creativity, culminating in a resonant final image. The last paragraph provides a beautiful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, turning the library into "a beacon that burns backward into the hearts of those still afraid."

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with exemplary subtlety and power, emerging organically from concrete actions and images. The central idea of memory as sustenance is crystallized perfectly in the act of sealing the chronicle inside the bell, transforming a simple object into a resonant symbol of cultural endurance without a single line of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic development is deeply integrated and resonant. The story explores the nature of love, memory, and healing through a powerful central metaphor of breath and reciprocity, avoiding sentimentality. The final realization, "love calcifies when breath forgets its reciprocal duty," functions as a potent, non-literal answer to the initial problem, landing as an earned epiphany rather than an authorial statement. The final image of the protagonist "distributing" love provides a perfect, lingering conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of time and memory is explored with exceptional depth and sophistication, avoiding all cliché. The narrative beautifully reframes memory not as a static archive to be preserved but as a dynamic, living medium to be cultivated. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, crystallizing the idea that true preservation comes from letting go. The piece achieves this without a single line of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric, emerging from the contrast between ephemeral carnival prizes and enduring heritage grains. The final thematic statement is direct but earned, functioning as the capstone of the Conceptual Repricing. Recurring motifs—the minor seventh chord, the cellophane, the concept of "staggering grace"—recharge the theme at every turn, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what true liberation requires.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the story’s dense, specific imagery. The final realization that trust requires hearing the "fragile hush" before it breaks is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final paragraph verges on being slightly too explicit, but frames the insight as future action rather than a simple moral, preserving its power.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic exploration of memory, forgiveness, and destiny is woven organically into the plot, culminating in the resonant final image of the flower petals rearranging themselves into a new code. The story largely avoids overt moralizing. However, the thief's spoken line, “Destiny’s door swings both ways,” and the final paragraph's summary of her new purpose come close to stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and earning a small deduction for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is impeccably woven through image and action, never through overt statement. The central ideas—of repurposing, memory, and the nature of sanctuary—emerge organically from Mara’s process of turning obsolete technology into a vessel for wonder. The story’s final action provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest, beautifully reframing "safety" as an act of generosity rather than retreat. This represents a high degree of thematic maturity and control, fulfilling the 9+ test perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of vulnerability as a source of power emerges organically from the character's journey and is beautifully symbolized by the mother's message to "keep the take where your knees shake." The final paragraph, however, falters by explicitly stating this theme ("Vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source, the live wire"). This direct moralizing replaces the resonance of the climactic image with a less powerful summary, preventing an otherwise excellent thematic execution from achieving its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of memory, art, and stewardship is sophisticated and emerges entirely through image and action, never through statement. The central idea that silence can be mapped and absence can be peopled is profound. The final lines—“the night was no longer empty; it was peopled with listening, a constellation of hushes that answered when called”—provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central problem, re-weighting the entire narrative with haunting power.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is expertly woven into the fabric of the plot, emerging organically from the central conceit. The final realization is profound and resonant. However, the line "thoughts came from the friction between what was and what could be..." verges on a direct thematic statement, an explicit articulation that slightly lessens the power of pure implication. While framed as the character's epiphany, it momentarily steps out of scene to state the thesis, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of forgiveness and the nature of honesty is developed with remarkable subtlety. The story avoids any moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge from Mira’s actions. The silent film is a brilliant device for subtext, an apology no words could carry, and Mira's final doodle of an "open lock" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central dilemma of being imprisoned by secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of intuitive knowledge versus empirical data is powerfully explored through resonant images. However, the final third dips into thematic explanation, particularly with lines like "demonstrating that its understanding of probability transcended human mathematics" and "The truth was more beautiful." These statements articulate the theme directly, slightly undermining the potent symbolism of the apple and the glove, which had already made the point with more grace.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the fusion of character, action, and image. The concept of "subdued awakenings" provides a lens through which to understand choice and identity, resisting any simple moral. The story's final image—the offset footstep—is a perfect, non-literal answer to the central question, offering a resonant conclusion without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated into the imagery, particularly the idea of finding art in "between-spaces." However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements near the end. The line "...it was about recognizing that the spaces between, the disruptions...were where real art lived" is a direct summary that weakens the resonance of the final image by stating the moral instead of trusting the scene to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic concerns regarding the weight of truth, the cost of protection, and the temporary nature of innocence emerge organically from the story’s potent imagery and specific actions. The piece avoids any moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal conclusion in the final logbook entry. This ending reweights the entire narrative, crystallizing its central questions into a poignant, quantified statement of "sorrow" and "temporary" innocence, which is the mark of masterful thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes its central theme with extraordinary discipline, never stating its purpose but embodying it through every image and action. The fusion of industrial and religious motifs (valve wheel as rosary, factory as purgatory) is seamless and powerful. The final image of beads clicking against ribs provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question that will linger long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory versus oblivion is woven through every image, from the bursting books to the regenerative silence. The final image of becoming a stone is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "she understood that her mind’s loose grip on reality was not decay but mercy" verges on a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the epiphany rather than letting it rest entirely in the final moments of embodied experience, which slightly reduces its subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of wonder versus certainty is explored with exceptional subtlety and depth, emerging organically from image and action. The story avoids any hint of moralizing, instead offering a complex resolution. The final image of wonder as an "after-echo like a pebble in a shoe"—a small, persistent discomfort—is a brilliant and resonant non-literal answer to the story's central question, elevating the theme beyond simple sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the interplay of image and action rather than statement. The core ideas—that stories inhabit places, that listening is a creative act, and that memory can re-center a broken world—are explored with haunting subtlety. The final image of the blank tapestry and the humming silo walls provides a powerful, non-literal resolution, perfectly encapsulating the theme of transference and the trade of personal identity for a larger, living history.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of identity and escape is explored with remarkable depth through the central motif of "open secrets." This concept evolves from describing Chen's fortunes to the nature of the sea and the lighthouse itself, creating a dense, resonant thematic field. The story resists a simple moral, ending instead on a complex, lyrical image of departure that serves as a non-literal answer to Chen’s struggle. The thematic work is sophisticated and fully integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic development is subtle and powerful. The central theme—faith as a wall versus a door—emerges organically from the action and imagery, particularly the woman's painting of negative space. The story resists simple morals, culminating in a resonant final image that recontextualizes everything that came before. The addition of "raw sienna, the shade of earth after rain" provides a perfect, non-literal note of grounded hope.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the story's central conceit, exploring memory, art, and the nature of home without resorting to exposition. The final chord spelling "you are already home" verges on being too direct, but is saved by its framing as a "language older than grammar." The final image of the child discovering the nautilus shell provides a perfect, resonant, and non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of identity as a sequence of choices is explored with nuance and depth, avoiding simple moralizing. The story uses its central conceits—the tablet, the father's clocks, the forking paths—to create a rich subtextual tapestry. The final image of the boy in the room of backward-ticking clocks is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, recasting the journey as a profound renegotiation with one's own origin.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of processing grief through sensory experience is developed with extraordinary subtlety, emerging from resonant images rather than exposition. However, one sentence near the end—"a filament to remind her that numbness is only silence waiting to be spun backward into song"—is a direct thematic statement that feels slightly less earned than the potent imagery surrounding it. This minor authorial intrusion prevents a higher score in an otherwise thematically brilliant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of truth's irrepressible nature emerges organically from the plot and imagery, particularly the contrast between smoothed forecasts and the "raw screams" of real weather. The final line, "weather, like conscience, cannot be quarantined," verges on an explicit statement but functions as a potent Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire narrative. It avoids a simplistic moral, leaving a lingering sense of costly, necessary defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic development is deeply moving and intelligent, weaving memory, scent, and loss into the story's fabric. However, the final two paragraphs slightly falter by over-articulating the theme. The line "...learning that to grieve is to cultivate..." and the final clause summarize the story’s poignant discovery, a slight misstep from showing to telling that dilutes an otherwise perfect thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the story's central contrast between the tangible and the ethereal. The final image of the poet walking with the rope is a profound, non-literal answer to the question of what makes life meaningful. It resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex, resonant celebration of process, texture, and the "weight of possibility."

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding generative beauty in incompletion is powerfully developed through recurring motifs of unfinished music, a single seed, and fractured objects. The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is capped here due to the explicit thematic statement, "beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation," which momentarily replaces subtext with a direct authorial explanation, a significant flaw in an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic exploration of truth, empathy, and self-deception is profound and seamlessly integrated. The story avoids moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge from the central conceit and Lira’s internal journey. The final image of the cracked vial offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the value of genuine feeling, however painful. The closing thought—“a beginning”—is a perfect, unstated resolution that reweights the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of compassion as a recurring, cyclical force is beautifully woven through imagery of tides, ledgers, and cargo. However, the final paragraph verges on overstating its thesis with lines like "compassion, like cargo, is only ever on loan." While elegantly phrased as Marisol's interiority, this thematic echo slightly lessens the power of the preceding dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of belonging as an enacted process is beautifully woven through the story’s central metaphors of sculpting and weaving. However, the climax suffers from a moment of thematic overstatement. The line “the webs of kinship were not discovered like landmarks but enacted like vows” is an explicit authorial summary that replaces the subtextual power of the moment, diminishing the resonance that the preceding imagery had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic resonance is profound, with grief, time, and memory explored through potent, specific imagery rather than abstraction. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Mira's quest for completion. The only slight weakness is the final sentence, which verges on stating the theme directly ("some debts are paid in full..."), slightly undermining the perfect ambiguity of the preceding action. It's an elegant summary, but a summary nonetheless.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of grief, loss, and memory is profound and seamlessly woven into the story's fabric through the central metaphor of mathematics. The theme emerges organically from character and action, culminating in the final, resonant image of the seedlings—a non-literal answer to the problem of absence that suggests new growth rather than simple closure. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex and emotionally honest portrayal of "solving for motion." The concept of ambiguous loss is handled with nuance and specificity, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of stories as beacons of memory and connection in a darkening world emerges organically and with great power. The final thematic statement, "Stories are lanterns...", risks being overly explicit, but framing it as a past recording from Elias's librarian days cleverly integrates it as a found object rather than authorial intrusion. This choice makes it a powerful anchor for the story's resonant conclusion, though it sails very close to the edge of a "thematic echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of control versus surrender is powerfully integrated through imagery and action. However, the final third weakens this by stating the theme directly: "But knowledge wasn't mastery—it was relationship." This thematic echo, further reinforced by the description of the assistant, slightly undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scenes by explaining what was already beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding new patterns and meaning in the ruins of a collapsed world emerges organically from the setting and character interactions. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Mara's initial despair. However, the story suffers from a clear Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph: "This is the real exchange... but the meaning we've threshed..." This line explicitly states the theme, slightly undermining the power of the otherwise subtle execution and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story beautifully develops themes of perception, memory, and the price of magic through its central conceit. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("clairvoyance is not seeing everything but recognizing the miracle you didn’t see coming"). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the power of the preceding dramatization by not fully trusting the reader to grasp the resonant implications.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's absolute core, emerging with breathtaking grace from the central conceit. The idea of archiving absence is explored through a series of concrete, resonant images—from washed-away cobblestones to the soundless valve. The final image of the note folding "into every doorway like a page finally turned" is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's question, achieving a rare thematic purity without a single misplaced word or moralizing statement.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is seamlessly integrated, emerging organically from the story’s central symbolic conceit. The tension between sterile precision (mapping) and vulnerable creation (painting) is explored with nuance and depth. The final image of Alden drawing the "first honest line" serves as a powerful, non-didactic answer to the story's core question about living an authentic life. The piece resonates with profound emotional truth without a single misplaced word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven into the story’s fabric through image and action, contrasting isolated reason with communal, felt experience. The resolution avoids a simple moral, instead offering a complex, resonant answer in the line, “confirming nothing she could publish yet everything she now trusted.” The final image of the sky as parchment provides a perfect, non-literal summation of the story’s core questions about observation and participation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of seeking finality and redefining "goodbye" is woven seamlessly through character, plot, and image. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from Vey's choice and the final, haunting image of the empty corridor. The repricing of the mutiny into a pilgrimage is a sophisticated touch, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions that lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's central conceit, exploring the relationship between truth, memory, and legacy without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of Cassidy mailing the document is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, solidifying the idea that true legacies are bought with honest sacrifice, not cons. The concept of "mathematics demands both sides lose something precious" is a brilliant thematic summary delivered as a character's worldview, not authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that history is a living creation shaped by desire—emerges organically from the story’s central magical conceit. The final thematic statement ("history is a bonsai...") walks a fine line but lands as an earned epiphany rather than an authorial lecture. The story's final image, of blank sheets as seeds, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, leaving a powerful and lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of identity as a curated collection of stories versus an officially sanctioned record is explored with profound depth and without a single line of didacticism. The story’s final image—a "single figure stitched from many mouths"—is a resonant and complex answer to the central thematic question. Motifs like redacted tape and rust accumulate meaning beautifully toward this powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—the limits of measurement versus the universality of human experience—emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The resolution avoids any simple moral, instead offering a complex, resonant answer in the idea that the riddle is about our "insistence on difference." The final image of the deliberately unvarnished cello, representing a truth that "ought to remain porous," is a masterful and subtle thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story explores themes of community, art as resistance, and the nature of value with remarkable subtlety and depth. The theme emerges organically from the particulars: poems on dissolving rice paper as prizes, corporate logos turned into grotesque masks. The final lines—searching for a symbol for "we are still becoming"—offer a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question about survival, resisting a tidy moral in favor of resonant, ongoing struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from concrete images rather than abstract statements. The central theme—witnessing as an act of resistance against forgetting—is beautifully embodied in the antique film camera, a tool of memory pitted against cosmic indifference. The final image of the film holding "the only color left of them" provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core questions about legacy, memory, and the purpose of curiosity in the face of inevitable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic development is elegant and deeply resonant. The core idea—translating chaotic feedback or trauma into functional balance—emerges organically from Lira’s backstory, her explicit philosophy, and the plot's technical problem. The solution is not just a fix but an act of teaching, which gives the final image of the drone's "map" of grooves a profound and lingering power.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven through the story's imagery and actions, never stated. The central inquiry into origins, language, and the limits of empirical mapping is explored with profound subtlety. The final image of the illuminated page dissolving to become part of the very rivers it depicts is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions, beautifully contrasting the Registry's static data with a living, flowing, and untraceable form of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of memory, healing, and sacrifice are beautifully woven through the story’s central images and actions, culminating in the resonant final image of Elian as the tenth bell. However, the final sentence slightly undermines this by explicitly stating the theme ("proving that what is rebuilt through rhythm remains..."). This brief shift to a declarative moral prevents a perfect score in an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic exploration of memory, loneliness, and communication is seamlessly integrated. The story elegantly transforms solitude into a signal and ephemeral scent into salvation, allowing theme to emerge from action. The final image of sailors dreaming of lilacs is a masterful touch of subtext. The final line, while beautiful, borders on a thematic statement, a minor deduction in an otherwise resonant piece that avoids moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story brilliantly explores themes of inherited trauma, the power of narrative to imprison and liberate, and the nature of forgiveness. Subtext is carried powerfully through recurring images like the "copperlight repose" and the "hush," which gain new meaning by the end. The final image of the labyrinth of light offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about finding a path out of a lie, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic depth is achieved through the central paradox of a mercy that resembles murder. The story explores debt, redemption, and unnatural cycles without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of the dead orchard and the reborn boy provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension. The recurring motif of the bead and the spiral brand elegantly ties the theme of inherited burdens to the physical plot.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of renewal through creative sacrifice emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor of weaving. It avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the bridge of verses and orchids blooming in salt water—that answers the story's central question. The line "every unraveling is only the first half of a weave" provides a beautiful thematic summary that feels earned by the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story’s lifeblood, emerging organically from the interplay of image, action, and character. Concepts of time, memory, faith, and colonialism are woven into the very soil of the orchard. The sundial, a tool of linear, colonial time, is repurposed to restore a cyclical, ancestral faith. The final image of the singing orchard offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story’s central question about what it means to rebuild a broken world.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    The themes of identity, memory, and the nature of communication are woven through powerful, specific imagery like the barcode/daisy chain gateway. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of thematic summary. The line "she understood that meaning lived not in the margins but in the act of mailing itself" is an on-the-nose epiphany that states the theme directly, slightly weakening an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of underestimated wisdom achieving what overt power cannot is seamlessly integrated. It emerges from every detail: the "pretty lies" that hold truth, the "children's nonsense song" that is a kill list, the "fool" who is the only one truly listening. The final image of her starting a new chart is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question of vigilance, reweighting the entire narrative without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is woven into the very fabric of the story's imagery and language, emerging with stunning clarity without a single line of exposition. The concepts of forgiveness, memory, and the weight of unspoken words are explored through the recurring motifs of water, breath, moonlight, and letters. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, offering hope without resorting to sentimentality or a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is woven into the story's very fabric through the central motifs of translation, memory, and wounds. The final image of the coral and cast provides a resonant, non-literal answer to how meaning can be "grafted" onto trauma. The narrative avoids tidy morals, instead offering a complex vision of healing as transformation, not erasure. A slight tendency toward articulating its own mechanism in the final paragraphs ("speaking the knots aloud until they loosened into story") is the only hairline fissure in an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory, sorrow, and reclamation is developed with subtlety and power through the central metaphor of developing film. The final image of the mural offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is held back by the explicit thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph ("She realized joy had never been lost..."), which slightly over-explains the story's conclusion rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme—the profound value of curiosity over certainty—emerges with exceptional grace from the story's intricate imagery and events, never once resorting to direct statement. The three awakenings build the theme structurally, while the final exchange between the guide and child provides a resonant, non-literal answer that recharges the entire narrative. The story's central idea is complex, but its execution is so specific and grounded that it feels emotionally immediate and intellectually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of intellectual and personal sovereignty is expertly woven into the very fabric of the world, emerging from particulars like taxable thoughts and subversive pollen rather than direct statements. The narrative resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex vision of rebellion. The final image of the vine spelling “Resist” in a code only fireflies can read is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with extraordinary grace. The core concept of "photosynthesizing pain into beauty" emerges organically through the story’s central images—the blossom armistice, the shell cathedral, the postcard—rather than through assertion. The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a complex, resonant image of a cyclical, generative peace. The final line leaves a lingering aftereffect of "reef-shadow joy" that is both melancholic and hopeful.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, sacrifice, and the nature of preservation without resorting to overt moralizing. The theme emerges organically from Lira's actions and the world's cruel, beautiful logic. The final image of the child with the bamboo tube offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what remains when a memory is saved. The internal thought, "the caretaker must become the final extinct feeling," borders on being too explicit, but reads as an earned, bitter epiphany rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story develops its themes of silence, legacy, and the power of language with nuance and evocative imagery. The final image of the shattered ink well offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the score is capped by a moment of thematic overstatement in the final paragraphs ("...it was about knowing which silence deserved to be broken"), which states the moral too directly rather than trusting the images to carry the full weight of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of “encrypted compassion” is woven throughout, with motifs like the surveyor's chain transforming from a boundary to a bridge. The final image of the breathing gate provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. The score is slightly tempered because the final paragraph’s explicit restatement—"the encrypted compassion had been decrypted"—while earned, verges on over-articulating the theme rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The themes of memory, identity, and art's persistence are woven together with immense grace. The central motifs—the meteorite, the songs, the paper trails—all resonate powerfully. The final image of the children humming the tune is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "identities, like songs, survive best when set free to migrate" verges on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise superb subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding one's way through memory and loss is beautifully integrated for most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs suffer from thematic over-articulation, stating the story's conclusions directly. The lines "...teaching her that some distances are necessary..." and "...every lost child invents their own way home" function as a moral summary, undermining the evocative ambiguity built by the preceding imagery and constituting a significant thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of memory, exile, and belonging is handled with extraordinary grace, emerging organically from images and actions. The story beautifully contrasts the cold data of "telemetry" with the warmth of "ceremony." The final image of the paper atlas page becoming a burnt feather is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, leaving a powerful and lingering emotional aftereffect without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of loss as a creative force is developed with nuance and powerful imagery, particularly the idea of "missing pieces" creating space for others. The story largely allows this theme to emerge organically. However, the final message written in the sand ("Every path disappears so that new ones can emerge...") is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext, verging on a moral summary in the story's final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of "orchestrated serendipity" versus "calculated wilderness" is explored with remarkable subtlety and depth. The story avoids stating a simple moral, instead offering a complex resolution in the final image: donating the duplicate bishop to the tide so "chance and design could continue their duet unseen." This act is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, providing a resonant and intellectually satisfying conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.9)
    Thematic handling is masterful. The story explores memory, resistance, and embodiment through concrete, poetic particulars without a single line of explicit moralizing. The final image of skin that "sang verses only the tide could read" is a stunning, non-literal resolution that recharges the entire narrative, leaving a complex and lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is masterfully woven through specific images and actions, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of the town's flaws being healed or transformed into rainbows provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry. The explicit statement "She understood the assignment" is a minor thematic echo that slightly over-articulates the idea, but it functions within the character's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic handling is masterful. The central idea of translating pain emerges organically from the potent, recurring imagery of fire, scars, ash, and water. The final image of the moon-printed spiral on the valley floor is a stunning, non-literal answer to the story's central question, offering resonance without a shred of moralizing. The concept that scars must be read, not hidden, is earned through profound scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme is potent and central, but its delivery is marred by a moment of over-explicitness. When Mira speaks the full equation, it functions as a "thematic echo" that states the premise directly. The story cleverly recovers with the final, more nuanced redefinition of hope from the grotto itself, but the direct statement in a climactic moment is a flaw that prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of "legacy's burden" is introduced explicitly but develops into something far more visceral and complex through the central metaphor of the camera-building. The story avoids a simple moral, instead offering a resonant, haunting loop in its final lines. The ending perfectly crystallizes the theme of inescapable, repeating history without ever stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative through resonant imagery rather than direct statement. The story explores the nature of persuasion, hope, and truth, contrasting "beautiful lies" with embodied potential. The final image of the painter ready to teach others to "sing the coded lullabies" offers a complex and moving answer to the central problem, avoiding a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of redemption through memory and the acceptance of flawed peace is powerfully integrated. The central motifs, especially the clipboard, evolve beautifully to carry thematic weight. The story avoids a simplistic moral, offering a resonant, complex conclusion. It is slightly weakened by a tendency to state its own themes directly with phrases like "flawed beauty," which reduces the power of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of preservation through destruction is explored with nuance and powerful imagery, culminating in the resonant symbol of the egg as a "fossil of sound." The story largely trusts its subtext and particulars to convey its complex ideas. Its score is slightly limited by moments of thematic overstatement, such as "He'd preserved their echo by becoming the thing that killed them," which articulates the theme directly instead of allowing it to emerge solely from the resonant action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, never stated. The central conflict between enforced harmony and authentic, painful memory emerges organically from the "harvest of echoes" and the "hollow statues." The final image—citizens filling those statues with lanterns made from their own memories—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, avoiding a simple moral by embracing the complex terror of true agency.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of ethical storytelling as a space for ambiguity is potent and well-developed through the story's central magical conceit. However, the final third of the story slips into overt thematic summary. Lines like "...ethical storytelling wasn't about choosing sides but about holding space for the smoke between them" and the manifesto-like ending state the theme too directly, replacing earned resonance with explanation and dulling the impact of an otherwise subtle story.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of honoring the overlooked through "temporary permanence" is woven into every element of the story, from the transient setting to the final act of release. The grandmother's words risk being overly explicit, but their placement mid-story functions as a remembered philosophy rather than a concluding moral. The final image of silver wire catching starlight offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, elevating the theme from a terrestrial act to a celestial one.

    Thematic exploration of memory, guilt, and the nature of preservation is sophisticated and deeply moving. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing its theme to emerge organically from its central metaphoric shift: from preservation as static, solid bronze to preservation as a "continuing vibration."

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of continuity versus decay is explored with nuance and sophistication, reframing decay as a form of liberation. The central idea emerges organically through powerful, recurring imagery rather than exposition. The story’s final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, although the line "walkers and paths are one another’s becoming" verges on being slightly too explicit for an otherwise sublimely executed subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—that pure knowledge, like mathematics, can achieve a permanence that empires cannot—is explored with immense subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the character's actions and the story's central imagery, never resorting to overt statement. The final image of the empty scriptorium, the magic square, and the unsettled dust serves as a perfect, resonant thesis on the endurance of ideas over power, a beautiful example of a Conceptual Repricing of the story's initial premise.

    The theme of true peace requiring self-acceptance emerges organically from the narrative, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of boundaries is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the character's craft and conflict. The final image of the orchard provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the epiphany is articulated with a slight over-explicitness ("a man so busy erasing boundaries that he had drawn one around himself"), which, while elegantly phrased, borders on stating the theme directly rather than letting it rest entirely in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of persistence, broken promises, and generational healing emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central questions. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph’s slight over-articulation in a single phrase ("photosynthesize into hope"), which risks summarizing a theme that the preceding events had already so powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of inheritance, knowledge, and choice is sophisticated and seamlessly integrated. The motif of bathroom epiphanies is used with startling effectiveness, grounding abstract philosophy in a concrete, personal history.

This is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, achieved without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding patterns and hope amidst ruin is beautifully developed through resonant imagery. The final image of the rose-colored light is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is significantly reduced by the explicit thematic statement in the last two paragraphs ("She understood then... not accidents but refractions of one intention" and "...promising...that patterns exist..."). This "Thematic Echo" undermines the subtext by stating the moral overtly.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.8)

The exploration of collective versus individual memory, the nature of history, and the role of the witness is profound and handled with immense subtlety.

It avoids any hint of moralizing, achieving pure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of balancing tradition and progress is woven skillfully through the story's imagery and core conflict. However, the final paragraph moves from resonant embodiment to direct statement. Lines like "accepting responsibility for maintaining the delicate balance" function as a thematic summary, slightly undermining the power of the preceding journey by stating the moral outright instead of letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of paradoxical healing emerges organically from the central metaphor and events. However, the story falters by making its subtext text in the climax. The line "Sometimes we must learn to die properly before we can live again" is a thematic summary that slightly undermines the resonant power of the final image by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of transmuting intangible burdens like debt and regret into tangible forms is executed with extraordinary ingenuity. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge from its potent central metaphors: promises photosynthesizing into debt, forgiveness as currency.

    The theme of finding growth in failure emerges organically from the story’s potent, recurring imagery. The final line found in the program, "The play begins when you plant the seed," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back slightly because the power of the final thematic action is partially obscured by the prose error in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of small, magnified kindnesses is woven through the narrative with precision, never devolving into sentimentality. The story powerfully suggests that archives are "futures disguised as pasts," a concept earned through Rowan's specific actions. The final image of the accumulating snow provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lingering sense of profound, quiet hope.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of memory versus indifference is woven into every element, from the key to the starlight. While the broadcasted message "Indifference is a lock; memory is the key" borders on being too direct, its context as a piece of in-world propaganda makes it work. The final image of a "new map" of voices provides a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question without resorting to a simplistic moral.

The concept of reciprocity is demonstrated through her careful work long before it is named, particularly in the creation of "monuments to forgotten things." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the land’s plight, as the monuments become seeds of memory and the soil itself responds, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty is woven into every image and action, creating a rich, resonant tapestry. The final legend of the phantom admiral provides a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the line "to befriend uncertainty in planning is to let the mechanism run without hands," which borders on a direct thematic statement, though its impact is largely mitigated by the powerful, imagistic scenes that follow.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic development through the central metaphor of kintsugi is masterful for most of the story, emerging organically from action and imagery. However, the final two paragraphs shift from showing to telling, explicitly stating the story's moral: "to redeem is not to erase the break but to illuminate it." This thematic echo replaces the resonant power of the final images with an unnecessary explanation, a significant flaw that undermines the otherwise subtle and profound thematic work. The score is lowered due to this direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.7)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic exploration of memory, intuition, and release is sophisticated and deeply integrated. Recurring motifs—light, anchors, tides, salt—are woven throughout and reweighted at the conclusion with immense power. The final thematic declarations ("intuition is not a compass but a tide" and "We keep the light by letting it go") verge on being overly explicit, but are saved by being framed as earned, character-bound realizations rather than authorial moralizing. The final image of the children in the new light provides the perfect resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is impeccably woven through image and action, never stated.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic handling is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story explores the relationship between revolution, art, memory, and time without a single line of exposition. The central thematic argument evolves beautifully through Aurelio’s two poetic statements, shifting from despairing reflection ("the revolution reflects only the shatterer") to a profound act of re-creation ("the poem remains, revising its readers"). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of agency in a collapsing world, resisting easy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the world's rules rather than through statement.

The final image of the girl with the paper bird provides a perfect, non-literal echo of the story's central theme of reclaimed hope and color.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic development is deeply organic, emerging from the story’s central images—etched glass, negative space, and night-blooming flowers—rather than overt statements. The final insight, “The shadow is the root of the glow,” serves as an earned thesis that reweights the entire narrative. The story’s resonance is secured by the final image of the pavilion as a place for others to “reckon,” transforming a personal journey into a universal question.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.5)
    Themes of historical truth, personal sacrifice, and the complex nature of betrayal emerge organically from the plot without a single line of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric through potent, recurring imagery rather than overt statements. The central question of how to rebuild after failure is answered not with a moral, but with a resonant final image: collaboration and a new way of seeing. The amber bottle's transformation from a symbol of a past error to a lens for a new perspective is a brilliant thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength. It explores memory, grief, and the nature of promises with immense sophistication, all without a single line of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic concerns of inheritance, debt, and order versus chaos emerge organically from the story’s potent imagery and action. The line “Vortex inheritance… is a library you shelve” verges on being overly explicit, but is immediately justified by the subsequent dramatization. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about time and legacy, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of "listening over noise" is developed with extraordinary grace and precision. It emerges organically from Mara's actions, the contrast between the siren and the bell, and the story's imagery. The final realization is earned and powerful. The concluding lines verge on stating the theme directly ("a humble storm siren tester still favors listening over noise"), but this is mitigated by being filtered through the public's lingering memory, functioning as a resonant final image rather than simple authorial moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of strength in vulnerability is powerfully developed through the central meteor metaphor. However, the story momentarily falters by stating its thesis directly: "understanding that strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere." This moment of telling, rather than showing, is a minor but significant flaw, preventing the theme from emerging purely through subtext and image and slightly undermining the otherwise resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of memory, silence, and connection is explored with profound subtlety and depth.

The final realization is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, achieved through image and action rather than pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is developed with exceptional grace through a cascade of interlocking images. However, the story falters at the very end by stating its theme directly: “Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use.” This line, an example of Thematic Echo, undermines the powerful subtext built so carefully, replacing earned resonance with a tidy moral and preventing the piece from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of interspecies collaboration and architecture as a living conversation is seamlessly integrated and emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids sentimentality, presenting a complex, resonant vision. The final image of the lantern is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The diary entry, "Architecture is only complete when it forgets the architect," borders on being too explicit, but its framing as a personal note just before the final act allows it to land as an earned epiphany rather than an authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of authentic versus artificial belonging emerges organically from the plot and imagery, particularly the contrast between the fly amber and the harvested "chemistry of homecoming." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the score is slightly tempered by a few lines near the end that verge on explicit thematic statement, such as "...the human need to belong could be reduced to a formula," which slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.8)

The concept of vegetation metabolizing gunpowder is a powerful, unforgettable metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic development is the story's greatest strength, weaving the idea of connection across distance through every element. The final image of the softening wax leaf provides a perfect, non-literal resonant answer to the story's questions about memory and life. However, the final sentence, "a tinted revelation that closeness had always been the only distance worth traveling," borders on a thematic summary. While poetic, it slightly over-articulates the theme that the preceding 700 words had already so beautifully dramatized, a minor but notable flaw for an otherwise flawless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of "true north" as an emotional anchor rather than a physical direction is woven through the narrative with immense skill. However, the final caption in the sketchbook, “True north is whoever waits for you to turn confusion into exploration,” verges on a "Thematic Echo." It states the theme a bit too plainly, slightly undermining the power of the preceding resonant images and costing an otherwise flawless execution a few points.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story masterfully explores its themes of wonder versus certainty, and the nature of freedom, without a single line of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of home and belonging is masterfully woven through character, setting, and magic, emerging organically from the story's particulars. The final revelation—"Home is not where you are safe—it is where you are necessary"—functions as an earned Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire narrative. It avoids simple moralizing by offering a complex, challenging insight delivered through an in-world mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of forgiveness as reframing rather than forgetting is beautifully integrated through the central metaphors of chess and weaving. The final image of the checkmated but smiling king is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final paragraph succumbs to thematic summary, with lines like “The board is wider than the mistake” stating the moral too directly. This explicit declaration slightly undermines the power of the preceding imagery, constituting a 'Thematic Echo' that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of forgiveness, truth, and art is handled with exceptional subtlety and depth. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex answer through its central image: truth is not a single point to be deflected, but a spectrum to be borne.

The ending hums with earned meaning, a testament to a theme that has been fully integrated into character, setting, and action.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding meaning and beauty in ruin is masterfully integrated through the central metaphor of kintsugi. The concept emerges organically from character, action, and image. The final line, “Memory endures beyond the vessel,” while powerful, is a slight thematic echo that verges on stating the theme directly. This slightly tempers the resonance of the final image, which would have carried the full weight on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of preserving memory against decay is explored with extraordinary subtlety and power, culminating in the concept of a "temporary eternity." The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the final image—the hidden canvas illuminated for no one—to provide a profound and resonant answer to the central thematic question. The recurring motifs of salt, mirrors, and contained images are reweighted perfectly at the closure, achieving a rare level of thematic harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from a symphony of precisely chosen images: whisper vs. foghorn, beckoning finger vs. searchlight, perfume vs. mechanical roar. The core concept is dramatized through action, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about love and distance. The piece avoids any hint of moralizing, trusting its "simple, unbearable love" to land through sheer textural and emotional honesty.

The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of loss: it cannot be reversed, but it can be transfigured into a new geography, a "country you can finally walk across without bleeding." This is a sophisticated and emotionally honest resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic exploration of truth, guilt, and safety is nuanced and deeply integrated, emerging organically from image and action rather than statement. The final image of the orchard as a confessional offers a profound, non-literal answer to the narrator's quest. The story's central idea—that true psychological safety requires surrender, not armor—is beautifully and hauntingly realized.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic exploration of memory, debt, and the nature of "keeping" is sophisticated and emerges entirely through action and image. The story avoids any overt moralizing, culminating in the resonant, conceptual image of the dock as a "closed eye that had finally dreamed the same dream as the light." The anomalous logbook entry walks a fine line but functions as a crucial plot clue rather than a thematic summary, preserving the story's subtextual integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of choice, regret, and the nature of selfhood is explored with profound depth. Instead of offering a simple escape, the story subverts the premise to argue for the importance of seeing one's own life clearly. The final realization that "loneliness was itself a choice" is a direct, powerful epiphany. The closing image of the unlocked door and the chip settling into an 'O' (a circle, a beginning, a zero) provides a perfect, resonant thematic cadence without overstating its moral.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story explores complex themes of memory, sacrifice, and circular causality with remarkable depth and subtlety. The theme emerges organically from the central conceit of the time loop, avoiding any direct moralizing.

It's a haunting and sophisticated thematic resolution that lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of presence versus preservation is elegantly woven through the story's central symbols. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the score is capped below the highest tier by a few lines that verge on direct thematic statement, particularly "not to trap moments but to release them," which risks summarizing the epiphany rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic exploration of time, memory, and the purpose of narrative is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The central motifs of the wheel, the spiral, and the act of writing/erasing culminate in a resonant final image that answers the story's central question without resorting to a simple moral. A slight deduction is for the line, "I realized every story ends mid-sentence," which borders on being too direct, though its framing as a self-conscious utterance mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in absence emerges organically from the story’s particulars, culminating in a resonant final image of the fog lifting on “ordinary miracles.” The subtext in the interaction with Horace ("It breathes now") is superb. A minor deduction is made for the penultimate paragraph's direct thematic statement ("maps of emotional terrain are drawn as much by loss as by landmark"), which slightly over-articulates an insight the story had already beautifully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of transforming trauma into narrative is seamlessly woven into the story's fabric, emerging from action, image, and the magic system itself rather than didactic statement. The climax, where crystallized memories shatter into “luminous sentences,” offers a brilliant, non-literal fulfillment of the core motivation. The final image of speaking her brother's name into the storm provides a resonant, emotionally honest conclusion that avoids sentimentality and perfectly caps the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story explores its themes of exploitation, apology, and the commodification of pain with stunning sophistication. The central concept of the "imperfect miracle"—an apology that can be heard but not perfectly repeated or sold—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. Julian’s line, “pain is public domain,” provides a sharp thematic counterpoint that avoids any simple moral, leaving a complex and lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story’s theme on the unity of endings and beginnings, and the observer and the observed, emerges organically from its central images—the spiral, the dictionary, the mirror. It avoids overt moralizing, instead allowing the final revelation to land as an earned discovery. The concluding sentence, "The witness is the witnessed, the end is the spiral's still center," provides a resonant, non-literal answer that powerfully recontextualizes the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the thematic concepts are ambitious and intriguing, their execution is severely hampered by a lack of subtext. The story repeatedly and explicitly states its own meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a didactic summary. This direct moralizing ("...time was never something we moved through but rather something that moved through us...") completely undermines the powerful imagery that precedes it, replacing earned resonance with a flat, declarative thesis and triggering a significant penalty for thematic over-explanation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story explores complex themes of grief, memory, and identity with remarkable subtlety and depth. The central sci-fi conceit serves as a powerful metaphor for the process of mourning and the desire for closure. The narrative wisely resists a tidy moral, culminating in an ambiguous but deeply resonant final image of "light dispersing through relinquished grief." Dr. Voss's explanation verges on being slightly too direct, but it effectively frames the ethical stakes for Maya's ultimate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of probability, forgiveness, and reconciling with the past is woven deeply into the story's fabric through motifs of gambling, contradictions, and light. The final image of the traffic lights as "shuffled cards" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the score is capped below the 9+ band due to a moment of thematic overstatement in the climax: "She realized that to widen perspectives responsibly meant not to abandon probability but to forgive its failures..." This line states the theme too directly, momentarily replacing earned resonance with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of breaking cycles of stasis emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphor of the loop. The final image of the protagonist walking toward an “honest ending” provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the line “teach endings how to begin,” a moment of telling that slightly weakens an otherwise perfectly shown thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic development is subtle and deeply integrated. The story explores memory, loss, and the nature of preservation without a single line of overt moralizing. The concept of "regenerated covenant" and artifacts as "verbs" elevates the theme beyond simple nostalgia. The final image—the waltz with her daughter—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how we preserve what matters.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of connection overcoming solitude emerges organically from the story’s particulars—the paired moon rocks, the reciprocal joke, the rebooting rumor chains. It masterfully avoids sentimentality through its unique tone and specific imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, suggesting that the "cure" is not a single event but a continuous broadcast of kindness. The final image of the universe’s invoice provides a perfect, wryly beautiful thematic summation without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the story’s conceptual fabric, emerging organically from image and action. The central idea of mapping emotions is explored with profound depth, resisting easy moralizing. The final image of the mapmaker carrying his topography "beneath the skin" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his quest for coherence, while the recurring motif of the "quiet blaze" perfectly charges the story's final emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is the story's resonant core, emerging organically from the central conceit without didacticism. The idea of reinterpreting error rather than erasing it is explored with nuance and depth, culminating in the mentor's remembered wisdom and Mira's final acceptance of uncertainty. The closing image of her walking through the stuttering gravity is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, providing a lasting conceptual and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding value in absence and silence emerges organically from the story’s central conceits. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The only minor weakness is that the advisor’s lines, such as “Music is not made by adding, but by carving room for listening,” verge on being thematic statements, slightly over-articulating what the narrative already demonstrates so beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of destruction as a form of preservation is potent and well-integrated into the plot and imagery. The final image of the grandmother's tapestry is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is capped by several instances of "thematic echo," where the narrative explicitly states its meaning, such as "destruction's necessary role in preservation" and "sometimes we must destroy to truly save what matters most," which slightly lessens the resonance by replacing subtext with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic exploration of grief, memory, and consciousness is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story avoids direct moralizing, instead using the central metaphor of sound waves and entangled memories to pose a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of loss. The final image of the eternal melody provides a powerful, lingering sense of resolution that is complex and bittersweet. The line "to breathe life into a shared dream sometimes meant accepting that the dreamer and the dream were the same substance" verges on being a direct thematic statement, but it functions as an earned epiphany that immediately precedes and justifies the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of quiet knowledge triumphing over loud technology emerges organically from the plot and imagery for most of the story. The whisper network is a powerful and concrete manifestation of this idea. However, the final line, "To show that in a world of shouting and satellites, sometimes the quietest voices travel farthest," is a direct thematic summary that slightly undermines the resonance, functioning as an explicit moral rather than letting the final image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is the story's resonant core, emerging organically from the central imagery of reflected starlight and patterned shadows. The piece explores the nature of empathy, loneliness, and communication beyond words with profound subtlety. The final thematic statement—showing darkness it was "absence waiting to be filled with light"—borders on being overly explicit, but it functions as a necessary and earned Conceptual Repricing that crystallizes the story's meaning without dissolving into a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of questioning rules and finding meaning outside of prescribed victory is woven into every image and action, emerging organically from the narrative. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a powerful, non-literal resolution through the final image of chess pieces leaving the board. The central question—"what if losing is the only way the game learns?"—resonates powerfully without needing a direct answer.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding freedom by detaching from imposed narratives is developed with masterful subtlety through resonant, recurring images like the scrimshaw and the whale call. However, the story falters slightly at the climax with the line, "she understood freedom: not escape but the moment you stop translating your own heartbeat into someone else’s language." This is a direct thematic statement—a "Thematic Echo"—that explains the story's core insight instead of letting the preceding powerful images carry the meaning alone, incurring a penalty for telling what was already brilliantly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration is profound and deeply integrated, emerging organically from image and action rather than statement. The story resists simple morals, instead using the central performance to probe the complex relationship between grief, silence, and survival after collective trauma. The final image of the empty wrapper—a "flag for the morally ambiguous"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, brilliantly suggesting that new meaning can be found not in spite of ambiguity, but within it.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of art's power to rewrite reality is developed with nuance and powerful imagery, culminating in the resonant final image of citizens unsure if they cross a border or a stanza. The story largely trusts its metaphors to carry this weight. However, the final authorial-feeling summary ("For every law is a rough draft of light, she’d say...") borders on a thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext that was otherwise perfectly sustained. This moment of over-articulation prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the theme of finding beauty in imperfection is potent and well-developed through powerful imagery, the final third of the story undermines this by lapsing into overt thematic statements. Lines like "beauty wasn't found in perfection but in the courageous act of remaining broken" and the entire final sentence state the moral directly. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern in the closing moments significantly harms the story's literary quality by refusing to trust the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of creation over preservation is potent, but its delivery is too explicit, especially in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "true pilgrimage moves forward... propelled by the courage to question" state the moral directly, functioning as thematic summary rather than letting the resonant images do the work. This overt explanation dilutes the power of an otherwise nuanced and well-constructed allegory, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of grief as transformation is developed with potent imagery (withering/blooming, artificial/genuine). The central metaphors are powerful and integrated. However, the story falters in its final paragraph by explicitly stating its theme. The line "...we teach the dead to bloom again by allowing ourselves to change..." is a direct moral statement that undermines the resonant power of the preceding images, replacing earned subtext with thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is the story's great strength, emerging organically from the powerful synthesis of mysticism and post-financial-crash technoculture. It avoids all moralizing, instead offering a complex meditation on cyclical patterns, systemic failure, and inherited burdens. The final image of ink footprints as a "ghost protocol" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central inquiry that will linger long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme is developed with exceptional grace, emerging organically from the narrative rather than being stated. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex and resonant conclusion about collective memory. The final image of the community carrying their "atoms of nostalgia like lanterns" provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the central question of purification, reweighting the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic exploration of memory, commercialized experience, and hope is potent and sophisticated, culminating in a resonant final image rather than a simple moral. The story largely trusts its imagery to convey meaning. However, a few lines of explicit thematic articulation, such as when Mira "understood" her mother's choice, are slightly too direct, pulling the score just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, particularly the central metaphor of shedding layers to reconstruct an identity. The final image of the plaque and the freed chameleon provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about integrity. The score is capped just below 9.0 due to a few lines that state the theme too directly, like "reconstruction begins with visibility," slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic exploration of grief, memory, and healing is deeply integrated into image and action. The final image of swallowing the seed containing the sister's laugh is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central wound. The score is slightly tempered by the final two sentences ("scars are simply stories..." and "go teach the silence..."), which verge on thematic summary, though the preceding visceral journey makes them feel mostly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of love's persistence is developed beautifully through potent imagery and subtext. However, the story falters at the very end by stating its theme directly in the mother's postscript: "Love is never unused, only stored..." This "thematic echo" replaces the earned resonance of the final images with an explicit moral, preventing the story from reaching the highest echelon in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of creativity as a fundamental, life-or-death force is explored with poetic depth and avoids didacticism. By framing the warning as the sky speaking to itself, the story elevates a personal struggle into a cosmic principle. The final image and the rephrased invitation ("create, or perish, or create again") provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving the reader with a powerful sense of a continuing cycle rather than a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of memory's persistence after catastrophic loss emerges with extraordinary grace from the story’s central images rather than statement. The piece avoids sentimentality, offering a complex, resonant meditation on how what is lost can be cultivated and transformed. The final image of the clock keeping divergent time for the forest and the children is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the story’s dense imagery and symbolic journey, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to its core questions about identity. The final image of the philosopher becoming a source of insight for others elevates the personal story into a mythic cycle. The final realization, "You are not lost; you are distributed," feels entirely earned by the preceding events, avoiding didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of internal courage and chosen duty is coherent and central to the plot. However, its delivery is overly explicit. The story repeatedly states its thesis, as in "courage unused still exists within" and the final paragraphs' neat summaries ("courage unused simply waits for recognition"). This thematic moralizing, a form of "Thematic Echo," undermines the subtext and replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, particularly weakening the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is expertly woven through recurring imagery—the bolt, the snow, the discolored path—that accrues meaning without a single instance of authorial moralizing. The story poses a profound question about the price of silence and answers it not with a statement, but with the resonant final image of a future, possible sound. This non-literal answer, a "single note struck in the unpardonable silence," is a stunning example of thematic resolution through subtext and earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic exploration of truth, illusion, and the nature of power is woven seamlessly into the story’s imagery and plot. The final image of the fading ink is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The only minor weakness is the final message tucked in the colophon; it verges on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the superb subtextual work that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory versus loss, and witnessing as an act of preservation rather than mourning, emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. However, the line "Mira realized her role was never to prove loss but to remember the way back" verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and keeping it just shy of a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story achieves thematic resonance without a single line of overt moralizing. Themes of memory, hope, and the power of art to catalyze change emerge organically from the central images: the ancient lullaby, the buried stone circle, and the act of reignition. The final image of a shuttle trailing “song instead of fire” provides a poignant and non-literal answer to the problem posed by the rebellion's silence, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is woven into the very fabric of the story, emerging organically from character, action, and image rather than statement. The central conflict between engineered conformity and stubborn, curious life is beautifully realized. The final line—“why”—is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story’s central question, reweighting the entire narrative with a sense of profound, conspiratorial hope. The recurring motif of grandmothers' hidden alterations (splicing vines, stitching quilts, rewriting epigenetics) provides a rich, resonant thematic layer.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of grief as a landscape to be learned rather than a battle to be won emerges organically from the story's central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension. While the two "I think:" statements verge on thematic summary, they are framed as hard-won personal conclusions, earned by the visceral work preceding them, thus avoiding the trap of unearned moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme—that art and memory can transform absence into a new kind of presence—emerges organically from the story’s central images: the fragmented tarot, the sinking lighthouse, and the cracked mirror. The final image of the spiral offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's many questions. A minor weakness is the occasional tendency to state the theme directly (e.g., "redesign the very grammar of seeing"), which slightly lessens the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of time's elasticity in crisis is elegantly woven through the story's core conceit and imagery. However, the final sentence ("so that we might have enough moments to choose who we become...") is a critical flaw. It functions as an explicit thematic summary, a moral that undermines the resonant power of the preceding images, violating the principle of showing over telling at the most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of honest memory versus controlled history emerges organically from the conflict. The story resists a simple moral by acknowledging the destructive potential of the truth ("ignite mobs"). However, the final paragraphs come close to over-articulating the theme with lines like "without honest memory, no future generation could choose wisely," which slightly dilutes the resonance that was already powerfully established through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of integrating opposing forces is powerfully embodied in the central metaphor of grafting. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements. The final two paragraphs contain thematic summaries—"Mira understood now that to weave continuity through chaos meant accepting all threads"—that function as a stated moral, slightly weakening the resonance of the final, much stronger, image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of communication versus capture emerges organically from the story’s central conflict and resonant imagery. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead culminating in a powerful, earned epiphany that re-frames the entire story. The final image of the garden humming a chord that sounds "almost like forgiveness played backward through a conch" is a masterstroke of subtext and thematic resonance. It provides a non-literal, complex answer to the central question that lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the central metaphor without a single didactic line. It brilliantly explores the nature of truth as mutable and history as a story that can be edited with new evidence. The final image of a "wider, gentler" orbit allowing "room for future truths to join the dance" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of inherited shame, avoiding a tidy moral in favor of complex, ongoing grace.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's central images: constellations, trapped insects, and unfinished lullabies. The narrative explores guilt, memory, and the purpose of art without a single line of overt statement. The final image—the piece of amber, "now empty, clear as forgiven sleep"—provides a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest, reweighting the entire story with a sense of hard-won peace.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in impermanence is explored with remarkable subtlety and depth. It emerges organically from the core actions and images—ephemeral chalk art, a temporary sand mandala, a crumbling tile. The story's final image of Mira beginning a new drawing destined for erasure provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, beautifully embodying the epiphany that "meaning was not a shape to keep but a motion to repeat."

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme is profound and elegantly developed through the central metaphor of the “map of forgetting.” The story masterfully explores the complexities of memory, mercy, and survival. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a direct thematic statement, explicitly telling the reader the moral (“the greatest mercy lay not in what we chose to remember, but in what we allowed ourselves...to forget”), which slightly weakens the resonance of the preceding, more powerful images.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.7)
    Themes of memory, time, and the enduring power of art are integrated with exceptional grace. The story explores its central questions through action and image, culminating in a final, resonant image of an "endless encore" held within. This offers a complex, non-literal answer to the ghost's initial despair, avoiding any hint of a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of hidden human interconnectedness emerges organically and powerfully from the story's central conceit. The final image of the photograph as a "permanent record" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about reality and connection. The theme is complex, avoiding a simplistic moral and instead lingering with a sense of profound, shared experience.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, legacy, and witness without a single line of overt moralizing. The concept of the "transitional object" is elevated from a psychological term to a profound thematic mechanism. The final image of the floating staff and the audible coastline provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how the unknown can speak, beautifully reweighting the entire narrative that came before it.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of reassembly and finding wisdom in discarded things emerges organically from the central metaphor of buttons, thread, and prophecy. The story powerfully resists easy moralizing, allowing the theme to culminate in the final, resonant image of shared, silent understanding. While the line "the future is a garment we button together" verges on being overly explicit, its framing as a silent, mutual realization saves it from becoming a simple authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of finding and using latent courage is exquisitely woven through the narrative particulars, never stated as a moral. The central concept of "fixing what's broken" is explored through action, not just reflection. The story's final image of the snowdrop—a "white flag of a season still learning courage"—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly reweighting all prior events.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of distilling narrative into its essence is powerfully woven through every image and action, culminating in the resonant final image of the sphere under the tongue. However, the final paragraph verges on overstating its own mechanism with the line, "reminding him that every promise is a ferry, every ferry a thread...". This moment of thematic summary, while poetic, slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise perfectly executed subtextual exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is resonant and integrated into the story's imagery, it is significantly weakened by direct, declarative statements. Lines like "places resist change when no one remembers how to tend their kindness" and "memory travels forward only when carried by kindness" function as overt moralizing, undermining the subtext and replacing earned resonance with explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of cultivating hope in oppressive spaces emerges organically from the story's central images. The recurring motifs of light, water, and gardening are masterfully integrated. However, the story occasionally slips into direct thematic statement, as in "teaching him how memory can instill courage better than any sword" and "Every oar is a promise..." These moments, while beautifully phrased, slightly flatten the subtext by articulating the moral that the imagery had already conveyed more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of solitude versus loneliness is explored with profound originality and without a single didactic statement. The story's final image—the prairie singing "not with missing voices but"—is a masterful, resonant answer to the central thematic question, leaving the reader with a feeling of triumphant, strange creation. The equation "solitude equals momentum" functions as a new physical law in her transformed world, a piece of earned wisdom rather than an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming private secrets into communal art is beautifully woven through the narrative's imagery. However, the story slightly over-articulates its own meaning in the final act. The monk’s thought that a shared secret becomes “a bridge” and Mira’s own concluding realization are stated a bit too directly, substituting neat summary for the resonant ambiguity the story had otherwise masterfully cultivated.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of trust versus manipulation is central, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story frequently resorts to direct thematic statements, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like an authorial summary: "...a species that had learned to recognize the difference between genuine communication and cosmic con artistry." This violates the principle of emergent theme, replacing resonant imagery with a tidy moral that significantly undermines the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic resonance emerges organically from the story's central conceit, exploring rebellion against limitations—both cartographical and psychological. The theme is developed through recurring imagery (compass, maps, circles) that culminates in the final, resonant image of an "unwritten map." The piece resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex bargain about freedom and sacrifice, although the final line "she had carried the mutiny inside her" verges on being slightly too explicit for an otherwise subtle narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story explores its themes of memory, empathy, and art's role as witness with profound depth, emerging organically from character and action. The central concept of "unifying opposites" is powerfully dramatized rather than just stated. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The score is just shy of perfect due to the note left for the sheriff ("empathy may follow"), an explicit thematic signpost in a narrative that otherwise thrives on powerful implication.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration of memory, bravery, and erasure is woven deeply into the plot, setting, and character actions, emerging with tremendous force without a single instance of overt moralizing. The question, “What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?” is a perfect thematic crucible. The final image of the sky becoming a library offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, reweighting every prior detail with profound meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from the dense, interconnected imagery of music, photography, and bridge-building. The core concept of "pixelated amnesty" is explored without ever being reduced to a simple moral, culminating in a powerful final line that recharges the entire narrative. The story's final image—the unfinished bridge rendered in "silver halide and hope"—provides a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of overcoming loss.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with superb subtlety and depth, weaving together ideas of value, inheritance, and the nature of progress. The juxtaposition of worthless foreign currency and worthless startup equity is a brilliant, concrete anchor for the theme. The final image of the open satchel offers a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resisting a tidy moral in favor of resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of transforming shared burdens into light is woven through every element, from the bruised petals to the stellar cycles. The story wisely presents its central thematic statement ("Only when... become shared light") as a diegetic discovery—an inscription—rather than authorial moralizing, which preserves resonance. The final image of settled, smooth glass inside the chronicler provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question, though the conceptual clarity verges on being slightly too explicit for a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of confession as a living, growing thing rather than a frozen artifact is developed with exceptional subtlety and power. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex resolution where truth is nourishment for one entity (the seed) and a recorded secret for another (the orchard). The final image of the confession "growing, ring by ring, into the timber of tomorrow’s storms" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict that is both beautiful and haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece masterfully explores its themes of time, healing, and connection through resonant, recurring images rather than direct statement. The conceptual shift—the covenant as "photosynthesis" instead of a contract—is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The profound emotional aftereffect is only slightly blunted by the incomplete final sentence, which cuts off a key thematic word.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable subtlety and power. The story explores the nature of healing not as erasure but as integration, culminating in the resonant idea that "some holes must remain for the light to enter." This concept is never stated as a moral but emerges organically from the plot and is perfectly encapsulated in the final image of the humming sprout. The piece leaves the reader with a complex, lingering emotional aftereffect, the hallmark of masterful thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.7)

The contrast between ephemeral sound and lasting stone foundations provides a resonant, complex conclusion without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic development is masterful, emerging organically from the story’s central metaphor of translation. However, the final line, "haunted ambitions are just love that hasn’t learned how to change shape," while powerful, functions as a direct thematic statement. It verges on stating the story's moral explicitly, slightly undermining the resonant ambiguity built by the preceding images and actions, thereby just missing the highest echelon of execution for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is woven into the very fabric of the prose and imagery, emerging organically from the central conceit. The story masterfully explores the nature of memory and identity, ultimately arguing that preservation requires motion, not stasis. The final image of the librarian ascending to the next routine, certain that wonder "always returns under another name," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of dissolving "walls between hearts" is explored with immense grace and potent imagery, never resorting to direct statement until the final, earned release. The pearl, the confessions, and the final image of Mara within the mirror all serve as resonant, non-literal answers to the story’s central question. The final sentence slightly over-explains the new mechanics ("seashells carried by orphans"), a minor blemish on an otherwise perfect thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of guilt, memory, and forgiveness is sophisticated and deeply embedded in the story's imagery. While the graffiti quote is explicit, it functions as a found catalyst rather than an authorial statement, and its meaning is fully dramatized through the protagonist's actions. The final image of the paper boat on the "river inside me" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect without resorting to sentimentality or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's surreal events. Themes of language, memory, debt, and the nature of truth are explored through action and image, not statement. The central conceit—that time and language are interchangeable currencies—is a profound engine for thematic exploration. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions, achieving a lingering, complex emotional aftereffect without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of freedom versus control is explored with profound nuance, rejecting a simple answer for a complex, resonant alternative. The story's central question is answered not with a moral, but with the powerful final image of a destiny transformed into "a garden perforated by paths." The recurring motifs—mulberries, the lullaby, perforations—are woven together to create a lingering and beautifully ambiguous aftereffect, epitomized by the promise becoming "the color of maybe."

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The themes of memory, beauty, and sacrifice emerge organically from the story's potent imagery and central conceit. The final image of the smiling woman in the chip is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of forgetting. The final sentence, "the only ferryman is the one who becomes the river," borders on being overly explicit, but in the context of this lyrical fable, it serves as an effective, if slightly didactic, coda.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme—that healing comes from tending to wounds, not escaping them—emerges organically from every image and action. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead offering a powerful, resonant answer in its final images. The fusion of the hairpin and shell, its internalization, and the transformation of the valley's economy from debt to heartbeats provide a sublime, non-literal resolution to the caretaker's quest for contentment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of certainty's fragility versus the integrity of doubt is explored with profound subtlety. It emerges organically from the story's central conceit and imagery, avoiding any didacticism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reframing "not knowing" not as a failure, but as "the most honest position from which any real decision could begin," a conceptually rich and earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of existence as a cyclical act of appearing and vanishing is beautifully woven into the central metaphor of the stone and pond. However, the story leans into direct thematic statements in its final third. Lines like "...vanishing was simply another way of appearing somewhere else in the pond" border on over-articulating the story's thesis. This minor instance of "Thematic Echo" slightly lessens the resonance that was otherwise perfectly built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully weaves its themes of memory, belonging, and the nature of "home" through recurring, evolving motifs like the pulse, the birds, and the dust. The conclusion avoids any moralizing, offering a potent, non-literal answer to the central problem of "wandering." The final image of Cael as a living echo is a resonant embodiment of the theme, demonstrating that true navigation is an act of deep listening and belonging, not forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges with grace and power from the story's concrete particulars rather than from assertion. The central tension between automated wonder and simple, stubborn life is explored through resonant imagery, culminating in a final scene that answers the story's core question without stating a moral. The image of prefab light scattering into "something unplanned" is a sublime, non-literal embodiment of the story's conclusion about hope and authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic development is masterful, weaving together memory, vows, and the nature of perception without a single didactic misstep. The phrase "hiding behind truth" is reprised to connect the initial mystery to the final revelation, creating a resonant structural echo. The story’s final insight—that sound is light awaiting perception—serves as a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question, emerging organically from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is seamlessly woven into every image, from the coins as "apologies" to the prophecy as a "receipt." The story resists easy answers, culminating in a resonant final image of the universe listening. This offers a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central question about meaning, avoiding sentimentality or didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of sacrifice is integrated with breathtaking skill, emerging organically from the central images rather than being stated. The connection between sea monsters, last words, and the reaper’s existence is elegant and powerful. The final image of the paper souls rising provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a rare level of thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic integration is superb. The story explores memory, faith, and the power of sustained, quiet devotion without a single line of overt moralizing. The concept of "brittle devotion" is introduced and then masterfully resolved by contrasting Kael's individual fragility with the enduring strength of collective memory. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about belief and reality.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The themes of memory, loss, and the curation of history emerge organically from the story's central images. The final action of creating a new "museum of common loss" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. However, the final paragraph becomes slightly too explicit, with phrases like "not as relic but as living text," which verge on summarizing the theme rather than letting the preceding images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration is the story's greatest strength. The piece avoids moralizing, instead developing its central question through a cascade of potent images and actions. The final lines—"to harmonize logic and intuition is not to solve the mystery, but to sing it rightly"—offer a resonant, non-literal resolution that reweights everything that came before. It is a sophisticated and earned conclusion that achieves genuine profundity without a single misstep into sentimentality or abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration of trust, duty, and release emerges organically from the story's central conflict without a hint of didacticism. The narrative's central questions are answered through the resonant final image of a revised tally, a non-literal conclusion that reweights all prior events. The recurring motif of the "soundless echo" evolves in meaning, masterfully tracking the protagonist's internal journey from dread to peace.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of synthesis over opposition is developed with sublime elegance. It emerges organically from the characters' struggle, their nature as "complementary opposites," and the final act of fusion. The concluding line, which states the core paradox, borders on being a "thematic echo," but because it follows a complete and powerful dramatization of the concept, it functions as a resonant, earned crystallization rather than a reductive moral.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of innovation is explored with exceptional depth, moving from a stated goal to a dramatized, complex reality. The story's final realization—that the goal was to teach a haven to "write its own riddles"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without a whisper of moralizing. The image of guests as "pollinators" is a masterful touch that extends the theme beyond the story's frame.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of tending to grief by giving absence a form is explored with originality and profound emotional honesty. The central metaphor of the leaf-blower symphony is specific and sustained, avoiding sentimentality. The final image of the wife’s chuckle provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central problem. The only slight weakness is the line "He understood then that tending to the unspoken does not mean...", which explicitly states the theme. While beautifully phrased, it verges on a "thematic echo" that slightly lessens the power of pure implication.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story explores its themes of knowledge, uncertainty, and belonging with remarkable depth and poetic grace. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece comes very close to overstating its own theme with lines like the cultist's maxim, "waiting is not absence but attendance," a thematic echo that slightly lessens the impact of the more subtle, image-driven development.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration is the story's greatest strength. It takes the concept of "creative destruction" and, rather than merely illustrating it, complicates it with profound ambiguity. The final revelation—that freedom from one cage may be entry into another—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the alchemist's quest. The theme emerges organically from every image and action, culminating in the final promise that "nothing whole stays holy and nothing broken stays still," a thesis earned entirely through the preceding narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of endings, silence, and meaning is expertly woven into the narrative fabric without resorting to overt statements until the final, earned epiphany. The Hollywood star fragment—a symbol of ephemeral human fame—being consumed to reveal a primordial cosmic sound is a powerful, elegant metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of silence, beautifully resisting a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story explores themes of hope, refusal of loss, and the acceptance of responsibility with subtlety and depth. The central theme emerges organically through Arden’s actions, culminating in the final resonant image of him embracing a “permanent transient life” not as a curse, but as a chosen purpose. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing its complex emotional resolution to linger with the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of connection's nature is explored with nuance and powerful imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with moments of over-explicitness. The composite man's line, "You're mapping the spaces between us," and the final sentence's tidy summary that connection's texture is "the weight of being witnessed" function as thematic labels. These moments state what the preceding imagery had already successfully implied, slightly reducing the resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic resonance is the story's core strength. The concept of navigation as an act of hope and defiance is woven through every image, from the rusted chain link to the "cruel angles" of the new star charts. The story avoids didacticism, allowing its theme to emerge organically until the final, earned insight. The final image of the absent link as a "navigable void" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about finding a way forward.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story builds a powerful, resonant theme of memory, connection, and the weight of promises through its central metaphor and imagery, particularly the recurring carousel. However, it falters significantly by explicitly stating its theme in the penultimate paragraph ("In the incidental heroism of showing up...she had given the dead their closing parentheses"). This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial explanation, undermining the subtext so carefully crafted until that point.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of memory, witness, and the act of naming as a form of salvation is woven beautifully through the narrative fabric. The final image of the newly visible tracks in the codex offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question about how we honor the forgotten. While the final paragraph verges on stating its theme directly, it is framed as Mara’s earned understanding, functioning more as a powerful concluding epiphany than as authorial moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of failure as a generative force is explored with remarkable depth and originality. It emerges organically from the central concept and climactic epiphany. While lines like "failure is the corridor" are quite direct, they feel earned within the story’s lyrical mode. The final image of the sky as a "dark page waiting for ink" provides a resonant, non-didactic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is the story's lifeblood, emerging with profound grace from the narrative's particulars. It explores the nature of language, memory, and sacrifice without a single line of didacticism. The final image of the statue with a crystal heart offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what it takes for a culture to survive. The idea that memory translates into continuance is earned through a visceral, unforgettable metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming grief into levity is beautifully rendered through resonant imagery. However, the final two paragraphs verge on over-explanation. Phrases like "a living testament that the greatest expedition is..." and explaining what future visitors will find state the theme too directly, slightly diminishing the power of the preceding, more evocative scenes. This thematic summary at the end is a notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of organic life versus mechanization is explored with nuance and depth, emerging entirely through image and action. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the seed humming on a windowsill—as a non-literal answer to its central question. The concept of memory (the shell, the lullaby) versus programming provides a rich subtext that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of weaponized memory and accountability for broken promises emerges organically from every detail of the story, never once stated. The central concept—a "virus of memory" created by linking absences—is brilliant. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a level of thematic integration that is both profound and subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of silence as an active, musical presence rather than an absence is masterfully developed through recurring imagery (wind bells, the halo, the whispering gleam). The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer, reconfiguring the protagonist's entire world. A minor deduction is for the final two paragraphs, which verge on stating the theme directly ("silence is not absence but an unopened mouth"), slightly undermining thesubtlety that characterized the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—that stories are not static objects but a living resonance between observer and observed—emerges organically from the story’s specific imagery and actions. There is no moralizing; instead, the theme is embodied in the final, resonant image of the phantom silk brushing a patron’s wrist. This provides a beautiful, non-literal answer to the central question of where stories live, suggesting they endure through the quiet guardianship Calla now fully embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from a rich tapestry of interconnected images about memory, loss, and art. It avoids any direct statement, instead allowing the "cipher of longing" to be solved through action and consequence. The final image of the paper boat mobile, allowing patrons to borrow a memory of something they never lived, is a profound and non-literal answer to the story's central questions about absence, offering a complex resonance that lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from a rich tapestry of metaphor and symbolic action, exploring hope, fear, and memory without a single didactic statement. The story's final image—the deer of light inspiring the question "What if?"—is a profound, non-literal answer to the central problem that resonates far beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The themes of memory, habit, and curiosity are integrated with immense skill through recurring images and a central, powerful metaphor. The resonance is slightly undercut by the final two sentences, which veer into direct thematic summary ("curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home"). This explicit statement detracts from the more potent, imagistic conclusion that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through the story’s core images: resilience, memory, and defiant mentorship. The narrative avoids didacticism until the final line, which skirts the edge of being a direct thematic statement. However, its framing as an "annotation" within the story’s established logic allows it to function as a potent Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire piece, landing with resonance rather than preachiness.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme—that wonder is preserved through sharing, not hoarding—emerges with exceptional grace from the story's events. It avoids any hint of moralizing, culminating in a resonant final image of the sapling and the travelers' inherited memory. This non-literal answer to the story's central question is a testament to perfect thematic integration, reweighting everything that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with subtlety and power. The central theme—freedom versus perfection, release versus containment—emerges organically from the story's core conceit and is never stated outright. The final image of the vixen passing through glass without breaking it offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. The motif of silence is brilliantly transformed from a burden into a chorus of liberated stories, achieving a complex and satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of mystery versus mastery is woven beautifully through the narrative's imagery and action. The final image of the reknitted map offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is slightly undermined by being stated too explicitly, both in the mentor's axiom and the line "Elara understood then that..." which functions as a thematic summary and incurs a penalty for replacing subtext with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme—the physics of grief—is explored with extraordinary originality and depth, emerging organically from character, setting, and imagery. The final image of the snow globe as a "planet forming its own weather" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the story's final line ("Hypothesis confirmed—grief obeys conservation laws...") is an unnecessary thematic statement that restates what was just beautifully dramatized, constituting a "Thematic Echo" that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of expression versus preservation is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the story's unique imagery. The narrative beautifully resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex resolution through the resonant final glyph. The concluding sentence about the child receiving the message borders on being overly explicit but ultimately serves as a powerful, grounding coda.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of smuggling "delight into sorrow's fortress" is developed with extraordinary subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the central images—a smiling fall, a laughing mouth stain, an apricot tree in winter—rather than from any direct statement. The story's final action, planting the seed, is a perfect, non-literal answer to the central question, offering a resonant and complex vision of hope without a shred of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is impeccably woven into the story’s core conceit, emerging organically from the objects, actions, and central metaphor without a single line of overt statement. The story interrogates the nature of memory, grief, and legacy with startling originality. The final image offers a poignant, non-literal answer to the central question, proving that "empty spaces remember" by transforming an act of science into an act of cosmic myth-making.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of limitation as a unique form of sight is explored with nuance and power, emerging organically from the character's struggle. The final image of the "map of human limitation" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final two paragraphs contain moments of slight over-articulation, particularly the line about the guild's "greatest knowledge," which verges on summarizing the theme for the reader instead of letting the final image do all the work. This subtle thematic echo is the only element holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of language and story as a vital, sustaining force is masterfully woven into the plot, world, and resolution. It emerges organically from the events, particularly the chief engineer’s reveal that the ship "runs on stories," and culminates in a resonant final image that doesn't state a moral but embodies the theme. The transformation from "separate maps" to a "shared horizon" provides a subtle, powerful answer to the problem of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of repair through confronting, rather than replacing, flawed history is powerfully woven through the narrative's core conceit. The final image of the clocks ticking "inward" is a brilliant, resonant answer to the central question. A minor deduction is warranted for the line "to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped," which verges on an overly explicit thematic statement in a story that otherwise communicates its ideas through impeccable subtext and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of collective action and turning grief into purpose emerge organically from the narrative's central conceit. The recurring watering bell is a powerful motif whose meaning effectively deepens by the end. However, the final act is significantly weakened by explicit thematic statements, particularly Kai's line ("family is the crop we keep replanting"), which functions as a summary moral that undermines the earned resonance of the preceding images.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is expertly woven into the narrative's fabric, emerging from the central conflict rather than being stated. The idea that "imperfection was the only song worth singing" is beautifully embodied in the "beautifully flawed crescent" of the puppet's smile, a motif that finds its resonant conclusion in the adjuster's final action. The ending offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core question about sacrifice, memory, and mercy, leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of finding meaning through duty within an inescapable curse is developed with remarkable subtlety and power.

The final image of the fossilized handprints provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting impression of beautiful melancholy without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming absence into connection is woven brilliantly through the central metaphor of polymers and braided streams. Resonance is built through specific, concrete actions, culminating in the powerful image of strangers finding solace in her sculptures. However, the final paragraph succumbs to thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's meaning ("proof that polymers of memory can be rewoven..."). This intellectual scaffolding slightly undermines the profound emotional resonance achieved through the preceding scenes, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven into the core mechanics of the world, emerging organically from the transactions of absence and memory. The final image of the shattered bottle becoming letters provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about beginnings. A minor deduction is for the vendor’s slightly too-explicit realization, which momentarily states the theme rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme is potent and develops organically from the story's central conceit, resisting simple morals. The final image of transformed sorrow is resonant and earned. However, the last sentence ("that the best recipes...") functions as a thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the insight that the preceding scene had already powerfully dramatized, which holds it back from a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of connection dissolving isolation is powerfully and organically integrated, emerging from the core actions and imagery rather than direct statements. The closing idea that "bread can remember the music of its becoming" is a stunning, non-literal answer to the story's central question. While the phrase "a bridge is a song you can walk across" borders on being overly explicit, it functions as an earned internal realization within the fable's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, ambition, and the nature of creation through concrete imagery rather than abstract statement. The central concept of "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" provides a rich thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story explores profound themes of memory, knowledge, and the nature of legacy with remarkable subtlety and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging organically from the central conceit of finding music in brokenness.

The final image of the glowing insulator and the "almost-audible mercy" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding beauty in difficulty is elegantly woven throughout the story's imagery and central metaphors. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, explicitly stating the "lesson" in language that feels slightly too declarative. The resonant final image is powerful, but its impact is marginally diluted by the direct explanation of its meaning that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of empathy as sympathetic resonance is brilliantly conceived and dramatized, emerging organically from the story’s central metaphor. The final image of the mirror shard is a sublime, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the resonance is slightly dampened by the final two paragraphs, which explicitly state the thematic takeaway ("She would spend the rest of her nights teaching others...") and provide a voiceover from the diary's author, a thematic echo that lessens the trust placed in the story’s potent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is flawlessly integrated, emerging organically from the central actions and images rather than being stated. The concept of "what is hidden feeds what is revealed" is beautifully dramatized through the family custom, the seed's hidden potential, and Myrrh's internal shift. The story’s final images—the shared dream and Myrrh leaving the notebook—provide a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest for serenity without a shred of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story develops its theme through powerful, integrated imagery, particularly the final sapling as a "prism of every hardship." The core concept is beautifully realized. However, the final line of dialogue, "resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking," verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly flattening the resonance that the preceding images so masterfully built.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of humanity's creations achieving a dangerous sentience is compelling and emerges organically from the plot. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding narrative has already powerfully shown ("architecture could become alive," "she would spend her remaining years ensuring..."). This over-articulation weakens the resonance of the final image by replacing earned subtext with a direct moral.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of wonder's essential nature emerges organically from the story’s central conceit and is beautifully realized through resonant imagery, particularly in the final two paragraphs. The story resists a simple moral, instead illustrating a fundamental shift in reality. The final paragraph verges on over-explaining the consequences ("all because a bell ringer once chose..."), a minor thematic echo that slightly tempers the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of harvesting wisdom from failure emerges with subtlety and power from the story's imagery, particularly the final, resonant act of renunciation. However, the final paragraphs contain lines like “driven is only half of keeper; the other half is stillness,” which verge on summarizing the theme too explicitly. This slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext carried by the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of empathy, self-sacrifice, and connection is explored with impressive depth and complexity. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the story verges on thematic summary in two key moments: “Quince understood then that transposed empathy was not transmission but subtraction…” and the final line. These statements, while elegant, slightly over-articulate the theme, pulling back from pure dramatization at the story's conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory fading into myth is woven deeply into every element. However, the story leans slightly into over-explication in the final act. The woman's line, "sometimes the courier must become the message," and the final paragraph's summary of the "final lesson" state the theme with a directness that slightly undermines the power of the preceding subtext. This is a minor flaw in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of how memory and grief inhabit objects is explored with subtlety and depth. The central concept of "truthful lies" provides a rich, paradoxical framework that avoids simple moralizing. The final image of Elian leaving the prism offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his struggle. A single sentence near the end verges on stating the theme directly, but it is framed as Elian's personal conclusion, which narrowly avoids a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic depth is achieved with extraordinary subtlety and force. The story explores sacrifice, memory, and communication beyond language through concrete, resonant imagery rather than statement. The final image of the golden sap beads holding her silent threads is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, reweighting everything that came before without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of coaxing resilience from rubble is beautifully dramatized through Corin’s literal descent into the ruins of the past to forge a new future. The motif of dreams—from "awakenings yet unpaid" to teaching the stone "a new dream"—is woven throughout with great skill. The story only falters at the very end by stating its theme in the line "Azure defiance," a minor thematic echo that slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the intricate weave of image and action, culminating in a resonant final understanding of truth, memory, and consequence. The story powerfully resists a simple moral, instead landing on the complex weight of complicity. The final image of the bay exhaling a "question she is finally ready to answer" provides a perfect, non-literal resolution that recharges the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of witnessing, memory, and connection in isolation are handled with masterful subtlety, primarily through the subtext of the stone-and-glass language. The story avoids any overt moralizing. However, the thematic resonance of the final image is significantly weakened by the plot contradiction, which introduces confusion where there should be a complex, resonant ache.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven into every image and action, exploring the transition from static, recorded history to a living, laughing creation. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—Lirael’s shadow as the "first letter"—that provides a powerful, non-literal answer to its central questions about legacy and rebirth. The recurring motifs of print, light, and laughter accumulate meaning that is fully recharged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of how stories create a lasting presence is beautifully woven through the story's imagery, particularly the wing and the recorded voices. However, the story slightly stumbles at the climax with the explicit thematic statement: "Kael understood then why some people magnetize stories: they leave hollows in the world shaped exactly like themselves..." This "Thematic Echo" articulates the core idea too directly, preventing the theme from emerging purely through subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of quantification versus witness is handled with rare subtlety and power, emerging entirely from image and action rather than statement. The conflict between the astronomer's numbered trees and Mara’s final instruction to "quantify nothing" is a masterstroke. The closing image of cedar cones as "tiny sextants, offering second chances" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with subtlety and power. The story explores memory, community, and isolation without a single didactic statement. The central theme crystallizes in the keeper's epiphany: "the realm was dying because every mirror refused to reflect another’s light." The final image of communities rehearsing songs is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's core problem, offering a complex and emotionally honest resolution that avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of paradox and finding wisdom in flaws is woven beautifully through the narrative's imagery and central conflict. However, the story falters in its final two paragraphs by explicitly stating its conclusions ("the mistake was... believing one could correct the past without surrendering the future"). This "Thematic Echo" undermines the powerful subtext built earlier, replacing resonant imagery with a direct moral statement and preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory, resistance, and the cultivation of the sacred within the ordinary emerges with grace and power. The story avoids moralizing, allowing its themes to arise from concrete actions and images, culminating in a resonant final paragraph that reweights the entire narrative. The central concept of “tenuous absolution” is beautifully resolved not as a state to be achieved but as a continuous, active process, a deeply satisfying and non-obvious answer to the story’s core question.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration is the story’s greatest strength. It deftly interrogates the relationship between measurement, memory, and meaning without a single didactic line. The central concept, "Meaning endures where measurement fails," is not stated as a moral but is instead dramatized and proven by the chief’s final, defiant act. The closing image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question, leaving a lingering sense of complex hope that is deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety and power, exploring the corrosion of love and the paradoxical freedom found in disillusionment. The central concept of recording a feeling and the final image of the cylinder filed with "other broken things" provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. The piece achieves a profound emotional aftereffect without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of skepticism versus belief, and the nature of shared emotional burdens, emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. The final revelation—that weather-carriers are "elected"—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The final image of the ring sensing "connection" perfectly crystallizes this thematic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of memory, legacy, and art as a vehicle for healing are woven deeply into the story's fabric, emerging organically from character and action. The final image of the protagonist handing out blank paper is a superb, non-literal answer to the central problem. The score is held back slightly by two lines that feel like thematic summaries ("inescapable callings are not cages but tunnels," "forgiveness is just memory..."), which momentarily replace resonance with explication.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of honesty as a fragile, essential practice in a decaying world emerges organically from every element. The final realization is profound, resisting a simple moral by offering a complex, ongoing challenge instead of a neat solution. The only minor weakness is the line "Lira understood then that the map had not led her to a place but to a practice," which verges on stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the power of subtext in the final moments before recovering beautifully with the unfinished sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of wonder as a communicable frequency is potent and well-integrated. The final image of passing the wedge offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how memory and awe are preserved. However, the story occasionally veers toward stating its theme directly, as in "wonder is not a feeling but a frequency." While poetic, these moments slightly lessen the subtextual power, preventing a higher score by replacing earned resonance with a direct, albeit elegant, thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The themes of memory, nostalgia, and transformation are deeply and beautifully integrated. However, the story falters slightly at the end by stating its thesis directly: "...nostalgia isn't about preserving the past but about carrying it forward..." This moment of thematic echo replaces resonance with summary, slightly undermining the power of the final image by explaining it. A minor but significant flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of witnessing versus solving is woven through every image and action with remarkable subtlety and power, culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer of the offerings on the velvet cushion. However, the story's final line, "some locks exist only to teach us the shape of the key we already are," is a Thematic Echo. It states the theme directly, slightly undermining the potent ambiguity and trust in the reader that the rest of the piece so masterfully established; for a top-tier publication, this explicit moralizing is a significant flaw preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength is woven through the central metaphor of dance and the key phrase "vulnerability is not the lock, it is the hinge." The final image of the code spreading as a lullaby is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. However, the last sentence about the child on the boat over-articulates the effect, slightly diminishing the potent ambiguity and nudging the ending toward a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of memory as a physical, migratory substance is explored with extraordinary coherence and depth. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from its potent central images: the hollow whale, the salt cave, the gravity well. The final image of the lamps as "buoy[s] marking where memory had surfaced" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry, achieving a rare level of thematic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of mastering internal discord rather than eradicating it is powerfully rendered through action and image. However, the direct thematic statement in the final section, "tranquility is not the absence of fire but the mastery of its blaze," functions as an explicit moral that slightly undermines the resonant subtext, incurring a penalty for a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.7)
    The central theme of “agreed upon lies” is woven into every level of the story with exceptional skill, from the inciting incident to the final resonant image. It evolves from a social grace to a metaphysical foundation without ever being explicitly moralized. The ending provides a non-literal answer to the story’s core questions about language, memory, and solitude that reweights the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of memory as a collective, untamable force emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphor. The final image of the commuter humming the tune is a masterclass in resonant, non-literal closure. The score is slightly tempered by concluding paragraphs that lean toward summarizing the theme (“translating isolation into shared anthem,” “memory…prefers to live in plural”), which, while elegant, is a step away from pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of forgiveness, identity, and the incompleteness of life are woven effectively through the narrative. The final image of Mara writing "I forgive the unfinished" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The score is slightly limited because the story occasionally states its themes too directly, especially with the line, "we are all incomplete stories, broken sentences..." which feels like a summary that undermines the subtextual power built by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of closure and the nature of lingering grief emerges organically from the central metaphor of echoes. The final image of the seashell becoming whole is a potent symbol. However, the story's final paragraphs lean into direct thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding events have already dramatized ("endings are portable," "a finished sentence carried by wind"). This over-articulation slightly undermines the subtextual power, feeling like a safety net for a theme that was already landing beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with exceptional artistry, emerging organically from the central images of the snow globes, ice, and light. The theme—that memory can be salvaged and that "wreckage can cradle light"—is demonstrated rather than stated. The final image of the pure globe and the mirror of ice provides a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of "hidden effort" is woven through every image, from the mended nets to the invisible moon paths. The story brilliantly resists a simple moral, instead offering a series of resonant questions and a final, transformative action. The concluding line in the second-to-last paragraph ("understanding comes not from seeing but from doing...") verges on being too explicit, but is skillfully framed as a "message for the next seeker," which largely saves it from feeling like an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is impeccably woven into every element, emerging organically from image and action rather than statement. The story explores the corrosive nature of lies and the destructive, yet necessary, power of truth with nuance. The final image of the apples browning offers a complex, non-literal answer to the central question, resisting a simplistic moral in favor of a lingering, resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of memory, truth, and complexity is masterful, emerging organically from the story's core mechanics and imagery. The piece avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant conclusion in the idea of "teaching the light to hold space for its own shadows." The final image of "variant allegiances blooming like flowers" provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question that is both beautiful and intellectually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory as a living, continuous process rather than a static artifact emerges with grace and power from the central conceit. The story avoids didacticism by delivering its final thematic insight through the magical object itself. The closing image of the "new-old chord" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the past's place in the future.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable economy. The story explores mercy, memory, and connection not through statement but through resonant images: the glacier's memory in the ice, the mother whale's call, the shadows becoming a choir. The resolution—"teaching darkness to listen"—is a profound, non-literal answer to the central conflict that avoids simplistic morals and lingers powerfully after the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of patient, observant action as the seed of revolution is developed with extraordinary grace. It emerges organically from character, setting, and plot, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids any hint of moralizing. The recurring motif of sculpting patience is paid off with a powerful, earned image, providing a non-literal answer to the story's central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic exploration of complicity, control, and memory is seamlessly integrated. The parallel between the commissioner's political control and the father's domestic control is potent and never overstated. The story earns its final thematic weight, though the very last clause ("now it would guide these memories") leans slightly into direct statement, slightly diminishing the power of the otherwise resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic integration of mechanics, time, justice, and grace is superb, emerging organically from the central metaphor. However, the final paragraph lands on a slightly too-explicit thematic statement: "salvation is simply granting the world a second opinion before the final tick." This summary, while elegant, slightly undermines the earned resonance of the final image, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the synthesis of technology, art, and perception. It masterfully explores the nature of translation and pioneering without a single line of exposition. The final image—the sea mirroring "every future sky"—is a stunning, resonant answer to the central problem, re-contextualizing the entire quest as an act of creation for future generations.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story masterfully develops its themes of memory, corporate dehumanization, and the commodification of grief through action and imagery rather than statement. The core concept of "grief-clicks" is chilling and resonant. The final image of the blank user posting a chord provides a non-literal, haunting answer to the story's central questions about absence and data, leaving a powerful thematic echo without a shred of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of translating empathy into action is potently woven through the story’s core imagery. However, it is weakened by a direct thematic statement ("to map empathy onto action meant to treat another’s peril as a coordinate on his own skin"). This moment of telling, rather than showing, undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging with perfect organicism.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic exploration of patience, grief, and solace is masterful and emerges organically from the imagery. However, a few lines veer towards articulating the theme too directly, slightly undermining the subtext. Phrases like "umbrellas are just portable roofs against endings that haven’t yet arrived" and "patience, properly folded, is just another word for staying usable" feel like thematic summaries in a story that otherwise trusts its images to do the work. This minor slip into telling prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    A powerful theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of mismatched vines, but the story repeatedly undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The explicit labeling of his quest as a search for "intersubjective understanding" acts as a "Thematic Echo," stating the conclusion the reader should have been allowed to reach independently.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that true understanding requires a specific, quiet form of attention, distinct from interpretation—emerges organically from the central conflict and the protagonist's method. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the final image of the unknowing visitors walking above the preserved wisdom as a resonant, non-literal conclusion. This final beat powerfully recharges the story's core ideas without stating them.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of healing collective trauma through art is explored with nuance and powerful imagery, particularly the final dove made of "light and wounds." However, a few lines veer close to thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext. Phrases like "collective healing begins with admitting you are crowd enough to ache" and "masterpiece complete when shared" articulate the theme with a clarity that borders on didactic, preventing an otherwise brilliant execution from reaching the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of language, memory, and growth is sophisticated and seamlessly woven into the narrative. The theme emerges organically from the central conflict between the static, printed dictionary and the living, breathing library of voices. The final image of the book open to "zygote" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is impeccably woven through image and action, emerging organically from the story's particulars rather than being stated. The central concerns—memory, impermanence, and the nature of selfhood over time—are explored with profound depth. The final image of the prophet drawing a spiral on a dissolving fog statue is a perfect, non-literal resonant answer to the story's core question, beautifully articulating that "clinging to echoes was perhaps the most honest form of letting go."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's lifeblood, emerging organically from its dense, coherent imagery rather than statement. The concept of "harnessing the ephemeral" is explored with profound depth, culminating in the final image of the photograph containing the past and the sound of a leaf orbiting as a memory. This ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to let go, avoiding sentimentality entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding meaning in brokenness is woven beautifully through the central motif of the record. Subtext surrounding Mara's own grief is potent and handled with subtlety. The story's power is slightly diminished by the final paragraph, where the line "reunify does not mean repair; it means carry both pieces forward" states the theme too directly, functioning as a "thematic echo" that replaces the pressure of a final image with a neat summary.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story masterfully develops its themes of absence, wholeness, and sacrifice through its central imagery and narrative structure. The final image of the reattached shadows is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the final sentence ("every shadow is only love bent into shape by light..."), which verges on a stated moral, preventing a higher score but only minimally detracting from an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic exploration of mistakes, truth, and forgiveness is sophisticated and deeply woven into the story's imagery, avoiding didacticism for most of its run. The final image of Elara's heart as a "map of bright fractures" is a resonant, non-literal answer to her central question. However, the final two paragraphs ("Years later...") slip into a slightly summary-like moral, explicitly stating the theme rather than allowing the preceding image to hold the full resonance. This minor over-articulation at the very end prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic concerns of memory, fear, and different kinds of light emerge organically from the story’s potent imagery. The central concept of sharing stillness rather than flame is explored with nuance and depth. The final image of Lira as a "lantern needing no wick" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, avoiding any overt moralizing and leaving a lasting impression of quiet triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of private healing versus public spectacle emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery and central conflict. Motifs like the pendant, the moss, and the dripping icicles accumulate meaning that culminates powerfully in the final image, providing a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions. The piece avoids easy moralizing, but a single line ("about the dignity of choosing what grows inside you...") states the theme a bit too directly, a minor Thematic Echo that slightly undermines the otherwise superb subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story’s central conceit. The narrative explores the nature of creative responsibility and the purpose of art without resorting to direct statements until the very end, and even that final thought feels earned by all that has preceded it. The final image of the shell as a "private lighthouse guiding tomorrow's unread stories home" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about hope and creation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of ancestral wisdom versus the losses of industrial progress is potent and beautifully woven through the narrative's imagery. However, the story falters in the penultimate paragraph by explicitly stating its theme: "...the understanding that sacred practices weren't primitive superstitions but sophisticated systems..." This moment of telling undermines the powerful showing that precedes it, functioning as a Thematic Echo that slightly diminishes the earned resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the story's central metaphors: starlight as ink, heartbeats as geography, memory as fuel. The final, non-literal solution of "relinquishment" provides a complex and resonant answer to the problem of mapping a living territory, reweighting all prior imagery without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic handling is superb, weaving together time, memory, and the tension between reason and wonder with a deft, lyrical touch. The theme emerges from concrete images and actions rather than exposition. The final image of the sealed timer placed between a child's rattle and a silent music box is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, a moment of profound and earned thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of confronting personal burdens to achieve a greater good emerges organically through the story's central magical conceit. The final image of the lamp transformed into a "small sun" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the final sentence spells out the moral directly, which slightly undermines the preceding subtlety. Removing this explicit "lesson" would have allowed the theme to resonate more powerfully through the earned imagery alone.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is profound and emerges organically from the story's central conceits. The themes of memory, courage, and loss are explored through the interlocking metaphors of lion taming and wood carving, never stated but deeply felt. The final paragraph provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, with the realization that "memory can be both cage and key" representing an earned wisdom that powerfully re-contextualizes all preceding images without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable subtlety and power. The story explores identity, regret, and the nature of memory not through exposition, but through its central conceit of collecting and trading fragments. The final image of the narrator becoming a weightless, pocketless fragment collector is a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what constitutes a self. It avoids any stated moral, allowing the haunting final state to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that hope is an engineered system and departure can be rerouted into arrival—is brilliantly integrated. It emerges from every action and image rather than being stated, despite the initial setup. The final image of the beacon, the child's laugh as "datum zero," and the light-dripping pipes offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. It masterfully avoids a simple moral, instead presenting a complex, beautiful equation where "math proves kindness is structural."

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of conflicting temporalities—mechanical versus natural—is masterfully woven through every image, from the chronometer to the linden tree. The final image of the tree keeping time is a sublime, non-literal resolution to Elara's struggle, re-contextualizing her "abandoned dream" as a successful transformation. It achieves profound resonance without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of dismantling historical lies is seamlessly integrated, emerging organically from the plot and imagery rather than declaration. The central metaphor of "the architecture of lies" is developed and paid off with the resolution to dismantle similar structures "beam by beam." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, avoiding moralizing for a more powerful, personal commitment to action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of living heritage versus curated artifact is explored with nuance and power. The story avoids moralizing by dramatizing its central idea in the final, resonant image of a seed growing in an impossible place. Ari’s line, "Heritage is a seed, not a glass case," while explicit, is immediately earned by the subsequent action, turning a potential thematic statement into a declaration of intent that the story fulfills.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming absence into a chosen presence is explored with profound ingenuity through the story's central conceits. However, the final third veers into thematic summary. Lines like "...writing obituaries for the living had never been about death but about the lonesome splendor of choosing one's own ending" and "...the geography of healing revealed itself as the courage to be witnessed" are Thematic Echoes that state the theme too directly, slightly undermining the power of the imagery that had already conveyed it.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the story's dense, specific imagery. The central idea of "flawed genesis" is explored, not stated, through the prince's actions and the story's outcome. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about creation, destruction, and beauty, avoiding any hint of moralizing while delivering a lasting emotional and intellectual aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic integration is superb, exploring how a destructive legacy can be transformed into generative healing without a single line of overt moralizing. The story's central idea, "scars can sing," is tested and ultimately affirmed through the concluding image and promise. The Icarus reflection and the coin's red thread becoming a "flare shot not for rescue but for reconciliation" provide resonant, non-literal answers to the story's core questions.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story explores complex themes of memory, forgiveness, and intergenerational trauma with remarkable subtlety. The central thematic insight—that memories ask to be seen, not forgiven—is earned through the narrative rather than stated as a moral. All symbolic elements, particularly the box and the geese, cohere to create a resonant and emotionally honest conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of breaking generational patterns by finding a new form of transmission is deeply resonant and emerges organically from the story’s central images. However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly. Lines like "patterns can be broken, if you are willing to become the wave" and "not in circles but in widening spirals" function as a thematic summary that slightly undermines the power of the preceding imagery, which had already conveyed the meaning with more subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory, lineage, and the nature of collective grief is developed with exceptional grace. It emerges organically from the story's imagery—poems, ribbons, butterflies, roots—rather than being stated. The final image of the spiral becoming a constellation is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, transforming a personal act into a universal map of mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=10.0)
    Thematic exploration of forgiveness, debt, and time is seamlessly integrated into the story’s central metaphor without a single didactic line. Subtext is carried perfectly through objects and actions, particularly the transformation of the rake handle from a record of guilt into an agent of absolution. The final image of villagers trading ledgers for seeds provides a masterful, non-literal resolution that resonates long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory outwagering oblivion is beautifully and organically developed through resonant motifs like chess, spirals, and gardening. However, the final paragraph contains an explicit thematic summary ("Mercy understands she is no longer merely the blithe cemetery gardener but the next keeper..."). This "thematic echo" flaw undermines an otherwise subtle and powerful execution by telling the reader what to conclude.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.7)
    This is a masterclass in integrating theme through image and action. The concepts of ignorance as a creative vacuum, innovation born of constraint, and creation as sacrifice are woven into every line without a hint of didacticism. The ending resists a simple moral, instead offering a resonant, lingering image that perfectly encapsulates the story's complex thematic questions.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of art's enduring power against erasure emerges with lyrical force, completely integrated into plot and image without a word of exposition. The central metaphor—teaching dust to sing—is developed with startling concreteness. The story’s final image offers a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to its central question, reweighting the meaning of silence, dust, and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's theme—that safety is a mirage constructed from fragments—emerges organically from the central images of shattered porcelain and incomplete stories. The final paragraph risks over-articulating its theme, but it functions as an earned epiphany that crystallizes the Conceptual Repricing. It reads less like an authorial intrusion and more like the character's own hard-won thesis, delivered with the finality of the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of competing narratives versus objective truth is woven deeply into every element. It develops organically through imagery—the cog, the strata, the ledgers—without overt moralizing until the very end. The final line of dialogue, “Time is a gear that eats its own teeth; choose the rotation that leaves you fewer lies,” verges on a 'thematic echo,' slightly over-stating the story's thesis. While powerful, this directness prevents a higher score by replacing a resonant image with a more explicit moral.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is handled with exceptional subtlety and power, emerging organically from the central metaphor of subtracting noise. The story resists simple morals, instead offering a complex meditation on harmony, absence, and listening. The final image of the children humming provides a perfect, resonant answer to the story's core question without a single word of explicit summary.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of beauty cultivated from decay is powerfully woven through the story's core actions and imagery. The final image of the disarmed officers provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. However, the penultimate paragraph beginning "She knew beauty was not the opposite of decay..." verges on a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral in a way that slightly lessens the impact of thesubtler, more powerful images that precede it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of wonder's fragility and the paradoxical nature of truth emerges organically from the story's concrete details. The central idea that a lie can preserve a more essential honesty is complex and resonant. The story's final image powerfully answers its central question. However, the final sentence ("wonder preserved if you speak the lie that keeps you honest") is a direct thematic statement, a slight moralizing that slightly reduces the resonant power of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of loneliness, consciousness, and the porous border between the mundane and the magical is handled with sublime subtlety. The theme emerges organically from the central conceit and imagery (hush, breath, displaced objects), culminating in a final question that resonates powerfully without stating a moral. The closing image provides a non-literal, haunting answer to the story’s central question about sentient loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is the story's lifeblood, emerging organically from image and action without a single didactic misstep. The central question—whether truth is a static verdict or a living dialogue—is explored with immense sophistication. The final image of statues "arguing gently over what truth might become tomorrow" is a resonant, non-literal answer that elevates the entire piece, demonstrating a masterful handling of thematic development through subtext and resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of regret as a recursive, infinite loop is explored with exceptional depth through the central metaphor. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex resolution where the key to breaking the cycle is not perfection but embracing the "chipped," asymmetric nature of reality. The final image of the chipped die lodging like a key provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest, reweighting the entire narrative without a single word of explicit summary.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of remembered kindness and the power of lost histories emerges with organic grace from the story's particulars. The mural being "for lungs but not for walls" is a brilliant, resonant concept that avoids didacticism entirely. The final image of marigolds on windshields offers a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful emotional aftereffect without a hint of sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story builds its theme of rescue as resonance through a powerful tapestry of interconnected images (bread, lens, honey, rosewater). However, the final act includes several declarative statements—"Art is not displacement, it is placement" and the final sentence about fracture versus fusion—that feel slightly too explicit. These moments verge on "Thematic Echo," stating the theme directly rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of meaning, slightly muting an otherwise profound resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of fate versus possibility is explored with remarkable depth and subtlety, emerging organically from the plot's mechanics rather than through exposition. The story's final image—a clock that tells "only the promise that any hour could still be changed"—is a stunning, non-literal answer to the central thematic question. The narrative resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex resolution where freedom comes at the cost of one's defining identity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of integrating, rather than conquering, trauma is developed with remarkable subtlety through image and action. The final image of leaving the clasp for the "next dreamer" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The piece only falters slightly with the line, "In that instant I understood...," which verges on articulating the theme directly. While it functions as a Conceptual Repricing, a more imagistic rendering of this realization would have elevated the piece to true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of turning obstacles into instruments emerges organically from the plot and imagery, creating a powerful resonance. The final image of the dancing children provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held just below the 9-band because the final sentence ("He heard the obstacle become instrument...") borders on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the subtext so carefully built before it.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story masterfully explores themes of knowledge versus safety, and benevolent control versus individual freedom, without ever resorting to direct statement. The theme emerges organically from the plot's central mystery. The final image of the "new, terrible chart" provides a resonant, complex answer to the story's core question, reframing the narrative from a quest for safety into the beginning of a schism. It's a thematically rich conclusion that avoids any simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of “noble lies” versus difficult truths is explored with nuance and depth, avoiding a simplistic moral. The story’s power lies in acknowledging the appeal of the convenient story before rejecting it. The final image of a new chronicle with wide margins for complexity is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question, landing with earned thoughtfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from the central metaphor of architectural wounds mirroring emotional ones. The concept of documenting absence to give it permanence is explored through action, not statement, allowing the story to resonate with profound ideas about memory, loss, and love. The final image provides a non-literal, deeply resonant answer to the story's core questions without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of knowledge as a tool of power and erasure is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the plot. The central idea of finding truth in absence is potent and consistently executed. The final line ("knowledge begins where silence is stamped back into speech") is powerful, but verges on stating the theme too explicitly, slightly diminishing the resonance of the preceding, perfectly rendered imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme emerges with sublime grace from the story's intricate tapestry of images and actions, never once resorting to statement. The central metaphor of grief as a flame to be tended, transformed, and used to create light for others is sustained beautifully. The final image of the crane-lanterns offers a complex, non-moralizing answer to the question of what to do with sorrow, achieving a resonance that is both profound and enduring.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the fusion of high-concept sci-fi and raw human grief. It poses a profound question about agency in the face of meaningless violence and answers it not with a moral, but with a resonant, complex final image. The "bleak exhilaration" of his sacrifice provides a lingering, non-literal answer that is intellectually and emotionally staggering.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of belonging as a unique "frequency" is woven effectively through the central concept. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, culminating in a powerful, resonant final image of the moving star-map. However, a few lines of dialogue, such as "'It prints belonging,'" verge on stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The themes of manufactured memory, guilt, and the nature of truth are masterfully woven into the narrative fabric. The final image of the driftwood—"even lies could shelter barnacles, even guilt could carve a cradle"—offers a resonant, complex answer to the story's central questions. A slight deduction is for the moment of over-articulation ("She understood the arithmetic of guilt..."), which states the theme a bit too directly, momentarily lessening the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom is brilliantly woven through the central object and actions. However, the final two paragraphs falter by explicitly stating the theme. Lines like "forgiveness is not a sound but a space widened by absence" and the final sentence about the forge are powerful but shift from earned resonance to authorial summary, slightly undermining the preceding subtext. This thematic echo in the closing moments is the story's most significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of finding strength in brokenness and navigating by feel rather than by formula emerges organically from the central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her struggle. The story resists a simple moral, but a few lines come close to over-stating the theme, such as "the broken navigator is simply the one who keeps navigating," which functions more like a concluding thesis statement than a purely subtextual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic depth is the story’s greatest strength, exploring redemption, memory, and empathy with nuance and power. The final image of the shared circuit of pain is a brilliant, non-literal resolution. However, the score is slightly capped by moments of explicit thematic summary, such as "Empathy... is consent to fracture" and "redemption isn’t a doorway; it’s a turnstile." While potent, these lines articulate the theme directly rather than letting the potent imagery do the work alone, a minor authorial intrusion in an otherwise seamless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's crowning achievement. The central question of what endures beyond change and death is explored through potent, concrete imagery rather than statement. The final image of the merged guardian, and the re-written fortune, provides a resonant, non-literal answer that love is a force of fusion, not just memory. The theme of transformation being both a furnace and a forge is earned through every sensory detail of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is woven through powerful, specific imagery, resisting easy moralizing for most of the story. The final image of her outline as a constellation is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary ("knowing now that lost time accumulates wherever love refuses to end"), which slightly reduces the potency of the otherwise masterful subtext, capping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic integration is masterful. The story explores grief, memory, and redemption without a single didactic statement. The concept of “shadow work” is dramatized through the collecting of photographs and the creation of the sail. The final image of humanity choosing to become a “quiet lantern rather than a final bomb” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question, reweighting the entirety of human history with a final, poignant act of mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is coherent and integrated, its execution is too explicit, undermining the story's resonant imagery. The final paragraphs engage in thematic summary, directly stating the story’s morals ("what is destitution but the perfect emptiness..."). This move towards telling rather than showing dilutes the power of the preceding scenes, replacing earned subtext with a tidy, almost didactic explanation that a top-tier publication would reject.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of turning instruments of oppression into tools of liberation is powerfully integrated through the recurring quill holder. However, the final paragraphs veer into explicit thematic statements, particularly "Tell the ministry that their ink has dried; we write tomorrow with light." This moment of direct moralizing slightly undermines the resonance of the preceding images, replacing earned subtext with a declarative summary that is less powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the story's thematic questions about grief, order, and surrender are compelling, their execution is marred by direct authorial statements. Mira's final words and Elias's epiphany are effective, but the concluding sentence, "Some promises are meant to be broken by understanding," is an overt moral that undermines the preceding imagistic power. This thematic echo in the final moment feels like an unnecessary summary, diluting the earned resonance of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story's themes of trauma, memory, and censorship emerge organically from its dense, coherent network of images. The central metaphor of developing a photograph is never over-explained but is allowed to resonate, culminating in the final, non-literal answer to the story's problem: "we become weather." This final image offers a complex, resonant reconfiguration of identity that resists any simple moral, achieving a profound thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, never stated. The story explores the nature of inquiry, arguing for collaborative journeying over adversarial debate. The central motifs—the needle card, the sundial’s shadow, the brook—all accumulate meaning and converge in the final, resonant image of stepping into the water. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the duel's opening question, reweighting the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic integration is seamless. The concept of "blooming resistance" and "beauty from anarchy" is not merely stated but deeply dramatized through every action. Subtext is masterfully handled, particularly in the initial exchange over Neruda. The story’s final images—the paper cranes with "instructions for breathing" and the cooling ashes as "compost"—provide a resonant, non-literal answer to its central questions, achieving profound emotional honesty without a hint of sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory, regret, and agency is explored with remarkable subtlety and depth, emerging organically from the central images of the clock, the film, and the music. The story resists easy answers, instead offering a resonant final image: the "unplanned encore" as a defiant act of self-creation. This provides a non-literal, emotionally complex answer to the story's central question about how one navigates time and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme emerges organically from the plot, avoiding all moralizing. The final realization that "luminous uncertainty binds stronger than blind belief" is not stated as a lesson but embodied in the story's resolution, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question that brilliantly reweights the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic exploration of apology, silence, and memory is masterful, emerging organically from the central images of bonsai and woven lace. The final image of the tutor and pupil walking toward the greenhouse is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line, "He realized the severance had never been exile but a long pruning," is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtlety of the rest of the piece. It functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the moral rather than allowing the final scene to embody it entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of gradual change emerges organically from images like dust patterns and decaying samples, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in nature's patience versus thresholds.

    Theme of time as malleable clay emerges organically from images like fading photographs and the seed, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in botanical impressions deepens complexity.

Subtext in thawing imagery and narration invites reflection on loss's complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Fulfills 9+ test with non-literal reconfiguration of safe zones.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from events like the decryption and shell's whisper, with subtext in gestures (trembling hand, sticker) and images (rust into galaxies) inviting reflection on identity without tidy morals. The final image of walking with the whispering shell offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of self-worth, reweighting prior betrayals through conceptual repricing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via honest contradictions in fear and certainty. Minor thematic echo in the closing line slightly overstates, but complexity in counter-readings (e.g., leaking as betrayal) lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of stewardship amid endings emerges organically from mapping silences, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the night's peopled hushes, eliciting resonant aftereffect through the lingering star burn.
