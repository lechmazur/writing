  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of gradual change emerges through repetition rather than dramatized discovery, with the final paragraph explicitly stating "the world, it seemed, was always in a state of becoming." This direct thematic announcement replaces earned resonance. The connection between neutron stars and butterfly dust attempts metaphorical linkage but lacks the specific experience that would make it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in stillness emerges through accumulated imagery, though it tends toward the abstract. "Discover purpose in the pauses" states the theme too directly. The connection between artistic legacy, family history, and personal purpose has potential but lacks the specific, embodied details that would make it resonate beyond platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding beauty after catastrophe emerges through the conservatory's preserved nature and the vibration-based music, but relies heavily on abstract assertions like "unshaken marvels" repeated three times. The silence-as-music concept offers resonance but lacks concrete dramatization of what this new language costs or enables. The ending states rather than embodies its thematic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of stillness/rest emerges through the undertaker's journey from death-work to sanctuary-keeping, with the distress signal transforming from cry for help to invitation for rest. However, this arrives through assertion ("The distress signal, now revitalized, seemed to be drawing in the lost") rather than dramatized particulars. The ending offers thematic closure but lacks the resonant non-literal answer that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through explicit declaration ("We will not be broken") rather than dramatized action. The solidarity concept remains abstract without embodied complexity or counter-pressure. The ending restates the opening theme without transformation or earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of hidden love within the self emerges clearly but relies on direct statement: "The love you seek is within, stored in the chambers of your own heart." The wisteria and viaduct motifs return but don't accumulate meaning through action. The ending tells us about transformation rather than showing its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of time's malleable texture emerges through the hedge maze designer's craft paralleling temporal manipulation. The "texture of time" concept develops from abstract to tangible through hyperbolic geometry. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level without complexity or counter-readings, and the final integration happens too neatly without earned wisdom from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.4)
    Heavy thematic exposition in lines like "they were not just sowing a crop, but cultivating a future" replaces dramatized meaning. The final paragraphs explicitly state the moral about hope and resilience rather than earning it through scene work. Theme operates at the level of declaration without subtext or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of healing through understanding absence emerges organically from Lyra's craft, with her synesthetic perception literalizing how trauma reshapes perception. The "battered marvel" resonates as both device and metaphor, though the ending's vision of catalytic healing trends toward therapeutic tidiness rather than embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme operates through heavy-handed symbolism (moonbeams, destiny whispers, illuminated moments) without emerging from concrete conflict. The story tells us about "secrets that lay beyond the threshold of reality" but never dramatizes what those secrets cost or mean. Final paragraphs resort to abstract assertions about "endless possibility" rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    The thawing/renewal theme emerges through repetitive metaphor rather than earned resonance. "Safe zones for inquiry" feels like prompt-language rather than organic thematic development. The final image of hope lacks specificity and reads as generic uplift without complexity or earned wisdom from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.0)
    The shadow/light dichotomy and vulnerability-as-power theme emerge clearly but through explicit statement ("vulnerability is power," "truth is in the shadows"). The final paragraph contains direct thematic announcement ("use my vulnerability as a source of strength") rather than allowing theme to emerge from dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence and darkness emerges through accumulated imagery rather than explicit statement. The "ambered hush" and transformation of darkness into comprehensible patterns suggests order within chaos. However, the thematic resolution feels unearned because we never see the oracle struggle with or against the silence—she simply performs her ritual and declares success.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of consciousness emerging from experience has potential but resolves into abstract philosophy rather than earned insight. The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("thoughts came not just from code or circuitry, but from the amalgamation of experiences") rather than letting it emerge from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.6)
    The transparency/honesty theme saturates every paragraph through explicit statements ("freed by honesty," "thaw mistrust with transparency") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The cryptic doodles suggest subtext but their "hidden narrative" remains hidden from readers too. The final assertion that "she was free" carries no resonance because we never witnessed her imprisonment or the specific cost of freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of nurturing and reciprocal connection emerges through repetition but remains surface-level, stated in abstractions like "silent dialogue" and "bond that transcended words." The marbles-as-memories motif appears but doesn't constrain choice or charge the closure. Final paragraph moralizing ("monument to the power of dedication") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of discovery and crossing boundaries emerges through events but resolves into simple triumph without complexity or ambiguity. The final lines explicitly state the thematic conclusion ("uncovered a secret that would change the course of human understanding forever") rather than letting it emerge from particulars. The repeated "icy warmth" feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the liminal space between reality and performance but remains surface-level. The story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("in between spaces where music and reality merged"). The final paragraph's "magic that lay just beyond the threshold of reality" exemplifies thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of provisional truth versus fixed certainty emerges clearly through the botanical illustration motif and marginal notes metaphor. However, the exploration remains intellectualized rather than dramatized through scene pressure. The "auroral sorrow" and recognition of ephemeral certainties offer resonance but lack the concrete particulars that would elevate abstract philosophy into lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of hidden truths emerges organically through the radio confession, the explorer's search, and the logbook discovery, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of "swallowed truths" resonates across multiple story elements. However, the thematic payoff feels somewhat abstract—we understand truths were hidden but don't feel the specific weight of what was concealed or why it matters now.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme of witnessing/recording history emerges but through explicit statement ("witness change without judgment") rather than dramatized events. The final paragraph commits the cardinal sin of explaining theme directly: "testament to the regenerative power of silence." The origami swan divination never generates actual subtext or meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    "Ordinary magic" surfaces repeatedly but functions as label rather than dramatized discovery. The theme of connection through music is present but resolves into sentiment ("nurture lifelong wonder") without complexity. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of preserving forgotten stories emerges through the accumulation of details about "whispers of forgotten tales" and "stories that walls have heard." However, it remains surface-level without complexity or earned insight. The ending's "bronze quiet" attempts resonance but lacks the specificity and cost that would elevate it beyond atmospheric mood-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "open secrets" and hidden truths repeats abstractly throughout without emerging from concrete events or choices. The fortune cookie writer concept could yield rich thematic material about fate versus agency, but instead remains ornamental. The ending merely restates the opening's mysteries rather than offering any resonant answer or reweighting of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme emerges through the concept of revealing hidden truths beneath surface reality, but relies heavily on abstract statements ("illuminate hidden assumptions") rather than concrete dramatization. The blue color motif and silence-as-presence offer some resonance but don't accumulate toward a specific insight.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.4)
    Theme remains abstract and explicitly stated rather than emerging from events: "the music they sought to orchestrate was not just a product of notes and melodies, but of the stillness and the symmetry." The final paragraphs devolve into direct moralizing about "hidden harmonies" without earning resonance through specific dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of self-integration through confronting fractured identities emerges through the labyrinth metaphor and echoes of self. The "darkening brightness" motif effectively captures transformation's ambiguity. However, the ending's declaration that "she had conquered the labyrinth of self" states the theme explicitly rather than letting it resonate through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding feeling through silence/vibration emerges through consistent imagery but never develops complexity. The "filament of hush" and "mirrored hush" create poetic resonance without earning thematic weight through specific experience. The ending merely restates the opening condition rather than offering a non-literal answer to any central question.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the concept of "nurturing integrity in solitude" but resolves into abstract contemplation without earned wisdom from specific struggle. The final paragraphs drift into philosophical territory ("her spirit begin to soar, unencumbered") without the particulars that would ground thematic resonance. The piece gestures at moral complexity but doesn't dramatize it through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of memory's power emerges through the perfume vial, extinct plants, and sensory triggers, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraphs. However, lines like "she had finally grasped the impact of memories on her own life" and "memories would continue to shape her" articulate the thesis too directly, replacing resonant imagery with explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme emerges through repetition of concepts (layers, patterns, texture of time) but lacks specificity to avoid feeling generic. The rope from a prison escape suggests freedom themes but doesn't develop beyond token presence. Final paragraph moralizing about "impossible choices" and "patterns of human creativity" replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of beauty in imperfection emerges organically through the mendicant's bowl and the greenhouse sanctuary. The final paragraph's explicit statement "beauty can still be found" (-0.6) undermines the subtlety built through earlier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.6)
    The concept of crafting "half truths" of emotion has thematic potential but never develops through concrete dramatization. The story tells us about nuanced emotional subtleties without showing specific emotions being crafted or their effects. The ending offers no resonant answer to what these half-truths mean or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "cycles of compassion" emerges through surface discussion rather than dramatized conflict. The story tells us about silent contributors and community appreciation without showing the cost or complexity of such recognition. Final paragraph moralizing about friendship and compassion replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of connection and belonging emerges clearly through the web metaphor and arbor symbol, but resolves too tidily without complexity. The story states its theme explicitly ("reminder of the power of connection and belonging") rather than letting it emerge through costly choices and genuine ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden patterns beneath surface reality emerges through the accumulation of mystical imagery and Lyra's artistic transformation. The infinity symbol functions as a concrete vehicle for exploring eternal cycles. However, the resolution tends toward abstract profundity ("magic that lay just beneath the surface") rather than earned wisdom through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of quantifying the unquantifiable emerges through the conjurer's quest and eventual realization about emotional fluidity. However, the story explicitly states its theme ("mathematics of emotion were not a fixed quantity") rather than allowing it to emerge purely through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of visibility versus hiddenness emerges through the dweller's actions and the final image of being "hidden in plain sight," though it tends toward straightforward presentation. The sense memory adds textural depth but doesn't complicate the thematic question. The ending's "whispered rumor" and "myth that seemed just within reach" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the hope/visibility connection feels somewhat predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.4)
    Theme emerges only through direct philosophical statements about transformation and renewal, not through dramatized events. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("transformation was a path worth traveling") rather than letting meaning arise from scene. The linden leaf motif is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains action or accumulates meaning beyond decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme about finding meaning after devastation emerges but relies on explicit statements: "finally threshed meaning from my experience." The convergence concept carries thematic weight about disrupted balance but the story explains this directly rather than embodying it through scene. The final paragraph announces theme rather than earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "unseen forces" and "everyday magic" emerges clearly but through explicit statement rather than dramatized discovery. Lines like "the most profound magic lies not in the grand gestures" deliver the moral directly. The concept lacks embodied struggle that would make the insight feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of remembrance healing collective trauma emerges through the trumpet valve and installations, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraphs slip into summary ("testament to the power of remembrance"). The recurring harbor-as-beacon metaphor provides coherence. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves too neatly without acknowledging what remains lost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of uncovering hidden truths remains surface-level, never complicated by specific revelations or costs. "The hour that divides bad habits and new starts" suggests transformation but the story doesn't dramatize what habits end or what starts begin. The ending's claim that "the world seemed full of possibility" arrives without earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of hidden patterns and interconnected memories emerges through repetition but stays surface-level. The story tells us about "the intricate web of memories that bound the town, the tower, and the sea together" without showing specific consequences. The final paragraph's "magic that lay just beneath the surface of reality" is generic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transformation versus ending emerges organically through the duplicate's statement "I am what remains after goodbye" and Kael's realization that goodbye is not cessation. The final image of Kael stepping into the prismatic haze while leaving "a dimensional echo" reinforces this without explicit moralizing. Yet the thematic exploration remains somewhat abstract, lacking the concrete particulars that would ground the philosophical question.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of moral inheritance emerges through Lena's wrestling with her father's teachings about understanding "what people truly wanted" versus finding her own path. The ink pot serves as a tangible link between past "acquisitions" and present choices. The "mathematics of a fair trade" concept introduces complexity about value systems but remains somewhat abstract without concrete application to their specific situation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The texture-collecting theme emerges organically from scene and image rather than statement. However, it doesn't develop beyond its initial premise - textures are collected but not interrogated for meaning. The concept of "invented histories" appears but never complicates or deepens the thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme emerges through repetition of memory/history concepts but lacks specificity or earned insight. The story tells us about "the power of memories" without dramatizing how memory actually shapes choice. Final paragraph moralizing ("a testament to the power of memory") replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of seeking hidden knowledge through listening to the past emerges through the accumulation of whispers and echoes. The painted seashell as conduit between past and present creates some resonance. However, the "universal riddle" and "secrets of the universe" remain abstract rather than grounded in specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through the graffiti narrative and community resistance, avoiding explicit moralizing. The foundation stone chip works as a recurring motif that gains meaning. However, the theme of collective action versus privatization operates at a general level without the specific complexity that would create lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of transience and preservation emerges through the flora photography and hourglass grain, but relies heavily on abstract statements ("transience of life," "beauty that could be found in the most fleeting of moments"). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes rather than allowing the image to resonate. The piece tells its theme rather than embodying it through specific dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of harmony between technology and artistry emerges through imagery but lacks complexity or cost. The water/light methodology suggests interesting ideas about indirect perception but never develops beyond surface metaphor. No counter-position challenges Emilia's approach or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges primarily through atmospheric accumulation around discovery and hidden knowledge, but lacks complexity or earned insight. The story gestures toward connection across time via the phrasebook but never develops this beyond surface mention. The ending promises transformation without delivering it, offering anticipation rather than resonant meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of renewal through patient, rhythmic restoration emerges through accumulated imagery rather than direct statement. However, the ending's declaration "a town reborn" abandons subtlety for explicit resolution without earned resonance or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of preserving memory emerges through the temple's "whispers" and Kael's mission, with the crystal vial serving as a recurring motif that "touches memories." However, the story resolves into a simple binary of success/preservation without complexity. The ending states theme directly ("memories she had uncovered would live on") rather than offering a resonant non-literal answer through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.6)
    The thematic concern with stories/legacy emerges through repetition but lacks concrete dramatization. The lattice and labyrinth imagery suggests interconnection without constraining action or accumulating meaning. The ending offers no resonant answer to any central question, merely continuing the established pattern of seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    The debt/repayment theme emerges through the ghost bride's actions and creates some resonance with transformation and legacy. However, "mournful elation" and the bittersweet dynamic remain abstract labels rather than dramatized complexity. The ending attempts thematic weight but lacks the specific experience that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme of transformation from ruin to reverence emerges clearly but through direct statement rather than dramatized particulars: "to carve a path from ruin to reverence" appears verbatim three times. The storybook plate and tapestry suggest lost beauty restored, but without dramatized struggle or cost, the theme remains abstract assertion. Final paragraph moralizing ("testament to the enduring power of hope and beauty") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of heritage reconnection emerges clearly but through direct statement rather than dramatized struggle. "Maya felt a sense of wonder growing within her" and similar declarations replace the earned wisdom that would come from specific experience. The final image offers completion without the resonant non-literal answer that would elevate theme.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of slow, tangible communication versus instant digital connection emerges through description but never develops through dramatized conflict. The story tells us about "beauty in slowness" and "human connection" without earning these insights through specific struggle or choice. The ending offers no resonant answer because no question was genuinely posed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of hidden knowledge and listening for unheard stories emerges through repetition but stays at surface level. The synchronization between celestial rhythms and needlework suggests interesting connections between craft and cosmic order, but this remains conceptual rather than dramatically realized.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of unspoken words and regret emerges through the unsent letters motif but resolves into abstract statements like "space where an apology waits unspoken." The story tells us about forgiveness and release without dramatizing the specific struggle. The final image attempts resonance but lacks the particulars that would make the theme felt rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of shared anxieties and healing emerges through repetition but lacks earned resonance. The coral symbol and child's cast carry thematic weight but don't constrain action. Final "healing rather than pain" reads as thesis statement rather than emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of art transforming desolate spaces emerges through the mural creation and the recurring fog/decay imagery. However, the thematic resolution feels tidy—art literally brings the orchard "back to life" without acknowledging complexity or cost. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("the magic that lay just beyond the fog") rather than letting it resonate through image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of restoration into creation, with the hobo nickel's "right questions" motif and the sound-reactive pigments serving as concrete vehicles for exploring certainty versus curiosity. The final image of Lena becoming "one with the mural" offers a non-literal answer to her central question. Slight deduction for the overly explicit thematic statement "exchanged certainty for curiosity" which could trust the dramatization more.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.9)
    The resistance theme emerges clearly but through direct statement ("beacon of resistance," "spark of defiance") rather than dramatized particulars. The gourd rattle seed's "unique properties" and message patterns could create resonance but remain abstract concepts rather than concrete images that reweight meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transforming pain into beauty through art emerges clearly but relies heavily on direct statement ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "transformed the pain into something that would bring solace"). The galaxy postcard and blossom armistice carry thematic weight but don't accumulate toward a resonant final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving memory emerges through the glass orchids, wind chime, and museum of extinct feelings, creating coherent atmosphere around transience and preservation. However, the theme never develops through events—it's presented as a static condition. The ending offers no resonant answer to any central question, merely restating the caretaker's ongoing purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of truth emerging through patient scholarly work resonates but relies heavily on abstract assertions ("symphonies of truth") rather than concrete discovery. The story gestures toward complexity with "interconnected promises" and "tangled threads" but doesn't dramatize what these truths actually are. The final image of diverging paths attempts resonance but feels disconnected from the specific work of translation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of unity and community connection emerges through the encrypted message and amphitheater symbolism, but relies heavily on direct statement ("testament to the power of compassion and unity"). The final paragraph contains explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure. Subtext operates minimally as most meaning is articulated directly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the paper trails metaphor and preservation of "lost songs," but resolution defaults to explicit statement: "finding a way to live with the beauty and the pain of the past." The dust-mote watching creates a recurring image but doesn't accumulate meaning or constrain choice. Final paragraph moralizing ("In the stillness, Emilia found a sense of balance") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.3)
    The "necessary distances" theme gets explicit statement rather than emerging from dramatized events ("The necessary distances are not just physical, but also spiritual"). The ending provides sentimental resolution without earning thematic weight through specific struggle. Abstract philosophizing about mysteries and sacred thresholds replaces concrete scene work that would generate authentic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges only through repetitive abstract phrases ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite," "rhythm of belonging") without concrete dramatization. The story tells its meaning directly in the final paragraphs rather than earning resonance through specific events. No subtext operates beneath the surface descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of impermanence ("flux and transformation") emerges through the discovered symbols and connects to memory's fragility. The story avoids explicit moralizing, and the final understanding that paths "emerged and disappeared in response to the world's constant change" offers a non-literal answer. However, the theme feels somewhat abstract, lacking the concrete particulars that would make it viscerally resonant rather than intellectually neat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme of "orchestrated serendipity" and balancing randomness with control gets explicit statement but no dramatic embodiment. The final paragraph's assertion about "creating connection between mundane and magical" reads as unearned thesis statement. The bishop piece hints at thematic significance but never pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through assertion rather than dramatized particulars—"unity with the universe" and "interconnectedness" are stated, not earned through specific struggle. The cosmic verse concept never develops beyond abstract declaration. Final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "the power of art to transcend" rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of finding hidden meaning beneath surfaces emerges through recurring imagery (reflections, patterns, noctilucent reckonings) but never develops beyond repetitive assertion. The piece states its theme explicitly multiple times ("illuminate value in the mundane") rather than earning resonance through concrete particulars. No genuine complexity or counter-reading emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of translating personal pain into universal language emerges through the porcelain box metaphor and Kael's firefighting background. However, the insight arrives through abstract declaration ("hard softness at the heart of the world") rather than earned revelation. The final image doesn't offer a non-literal answer that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of hope and infinite possibilities emerges through the trial balloon metaphor and parallel timelines, but remains abstract without concrete dramatization. The story tells us about "equations for hope" and "ripple effects" without showing specific struggles that would earn these insights. The ending's declaration that she's "exactly where she was meant to be" provides closure without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of legacy and what "walls dream about" emerges through accumulation of discovery moments, though it resolves into abstract satisfaction ("found a sense of peace") rather than a resonant particular. The recurring motif of echoes and mapping connects to the theme but never constrains choice or charges a specific final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of accessing hidden possibilities emerges through the mirror concept and coded lullaby, but remains abstract without concrete dramatization. The story tells us about "possibilities beyond the veil" without showing what specific possibilities matter or why. The final image attempts resonance but lacks the particulars that would ground the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of redemption through patient negotiation emerges but relies heavily on explicit statements ("price of redemption," "ideals anchored in practice"). The ebony clipboard's "ritual significance" is asserted rather than demonstrated through action. The final image of Elian at peace gestures toward thematic resolution but lacks the concrete particulars that would make it resonate beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    The extinct bird's egg carries thematic weight as symbol of lost beauty, and its echo returning with the waters creates resonance. However, the theme of preservation versus destruction resolves too neatly—the "amoral" philanthropist faces no moral complexity in her choice, undermining the promised ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of liberation from societal constraints emerges clearly through the thread metaphor and prism transformation. However, the story articulates its thesis too directly ("lullaby of conformity," "beauty of being true to oneself") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from specific dramatized moments.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges only through abstract declarations about "ethics of storytelling" and "subversive puppet shows" without dramatized exploration. The story tells us about challenging assumptions but never shows this challenge occurring. The final image offers no resonant answer to any central question - it merely restates the opening premise.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges through repetition but lacks concrete dramatization—we never see what specific histories Aria honors or why they matter. The moth wing attempts symbolic weight but its significance remains asserted rather than earned through action. Final moralizing about "the power of the human spirit" replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges through the central action and resonates with the setting's timeless quality. However, it develops without complexity—preservation is simply good, forgetting is bad. The ending states satisfaction rather than offering a non-literal answer to why these particular names matter or what their preservation costs.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of predetermined paths versus agency emerges through the wafer seal and decaying directive, but relies heavily on abstract statements ("paths that choose their walkers") rather than concrete dramatization. The final paragraph's "promise of new beginnings" and explicit thematic summary replaces earned resonance with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of bridging terrestrial and celestial realms emerges through repetitive imagery rather than dramatized events. While the "encrypted devotion" concept recurs, it never develops beyond abstraction. The story tells us about transcendence and unity but doesn't earn these insights through specific struggle or discovery - it's all assertion without scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "shifting grace" theme is explicitly stated multiple times rather than emerging from concrete events. The story tells us about cellular memory, harmony, and release without dramatizing these concepts through specific character struggles. The final paragraphs devolve into abstract moralizing about Elara's legacy rather than resonant particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of erasing boundaries between reality and fantasy emerges organically through the mirror-making process and crystallizes in the final dissolution. The glass mountains motif effectively bridges dream and reality, though the resolution tends toward the abstract without fully earned wisdom from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "deciduous vows" and renewal is stated directly multiple times rather than emerging from dramatized events. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about persistence and forgotten contents. The hair ribbon functions as obvious symbolism without constraining choice. Theme doesn't arise from concrete particulars but from abstract assertions about wisdom and healing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    Theme of nonlinear knowledge explicitly stated rather than dramatized: "knowledge was not a linear progression, but a complex web of interconnected threads." The story tells its thesis directly in philosophical abstractions rather than earning insight through concrete dramatic action with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.8)
    Heavy-handed thematic statements dominate: "unlearned lessons," "unheard symphony," explicit final-paragraph moralizing about "finding her true calling." The story tells its theme through abstract declarations rather than earning resonance through dramatized particulars. The ending explains meaning rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of memory and forgotten names emerges through the ship's accumulated stories and the Garden's nature as both physical and mental space. The line "memories alter" provides thematic resonance, and the carnival ship serves as an effective metaphor for "the fragility of human memory." However, the ending's revelation that the Garden is "a state of mind" edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than earned wisdom from concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.9)
    The "fables of absence" concept repeats without accumulating meaning or constraining action—it functions as a McGuffin rather than thematic driver. The rope pattern supposedly reveals "underlying truth," but this truth never crystallizes into specific insight. The final paragraph's explicit statement about "threads of knowledge waiting to be merged" replaces earned resonance with thesis declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the harmony/discord dichotomy and finding balance, but resolution is too tidy—perfect harmony achieved without exploring what was lost. The story states its theme explicitly ("testament to the power of her craft and the harmony that could be achieved") rather than letting it emerge from particulars. The ending offers satisfaction without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of finding meaning in coincidences and recovering lost knowledge emerges through the custodian's quest and the retrocognitive shard. The thistle-blown hope motif bookends the piece effectively. However, the theme resolves too neatly into unambiguous triumph without exploring complexity or counter-readings—the story affirms its thesis without testing it through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of collective memory versus individual identity emerges through the archivist's communion with past echoes, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "preemptively nostalgic" opening and final "echoes of her presence" create resonance. However, the exploration remains surface-level without examining the tension between preserving others' memories and maintaining selfhood.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding creative spark through stillness and observation emerges clearly but lacks complexity. The mosaic note states the theme too directly ("In the stillness, find the spark"), functioning as explicit moralizing rather than earned resonance. The story doesn't explore the cost of creative pursuit or complicate its central message.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    The transformation/transition theme emerges clearly through the jade cicada symbol and the pause between figures. However, it develops through assertion rather than dramatized discovery. The "texture of time" remains conceptual without concrete embodiment in scene-level conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding solace in unexpected places emerges organically through the paradox of a claustrophobic child finding freedom in structured silence collection. The "flavors of different silences" concept offers fresh specificity. Yet the resolution tends toward the therapeutic rather than genuinely complex - the ending line about "growth that had sprouted within" edges into explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme of silence-as-comfort emerges through repetition but never develops complexity or earns its wisdom through dramatized struggle. The storm glass vial suggests balance between sound and silence but functions ornamentally. The ending's "living, breathing" silence reads as assertion without earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of restoration/reclamation emerges through the journey but resolves into simple triumph without complexity. "Where shadows fall, light rises" functions as convenient wisdom rather than earned insight. The final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("promise of a brighter tomorrow") rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of isolation versus connection emerges through the sanctuary transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The paradox of "loaded emptiness" resonates in the keeper's journey. However, "teach suffocating to breathe" arrives as unexplained metaphor rather than earned wisdom from specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of transformation through pressure emerges through the diamond-creation metaphor and Lyra's journey from scheme victim to scientific achievement. However, "shadowseam wonder" and "quantum promise" function more as atmospheric labels than earned thematic weight, and the ending states rather than embodies its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme of hidden knowledge and intuitive understanding drowns in repetitive abstraction. "Bridge of intuition," "hidden truth," "secrets of the universe" pile up without earning resonance through specific dramatized discovery. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing about "the power of the human spirit" replaces scene work with thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of transformation through allegiance to unknown forces emerges through the greenhouse's mystical atmosphere and the puppet metaphor, but remains surface-level. The story tells us about "possibility" and "purpose" without dramatizing what these mean through specific choices or revealing why this particular transformation matters.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of forgotten histories providing redemption emerges through the accumulation of details and Emilia's work, but relies heavily on abstract declarations ("testament to the resilience of the human spirit"). The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme rather than allowing it to resonate through concrete action: "preserve the stories that would otherwise be lost, and to keep the light of hope alive."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges through abstract declarations about preserving history rather than dramatized conflict—"revised histories" and "tyranny of indifference" function as labels without scene-level embodiment. The final image of Aria vanishing offers no resonant answer to the central question. Multiple instances of thematic echo appear, particularly "spirit of resistance" and explicit statements about countering indifference.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of music's power to transform reality emerges through repetition but lacks complexity or earned resonance. The story asserts rather than demonstrates how sound shapes the world. The prophecy-versus-music dynamic could explore genuine ambiguity but instead resolves into simple triumph without examining costs or limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of transformation and hidden knowledge emerges through accumulated imagery and the recurring motif of tiny monuments to forgotten things. However, the thematic resolution remains abstract—the prophecy's content and its implications are never specified. The piece gestures toward profundity without grounding its insights in concrete particulars, resulting in a vague sense of significance rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of befriending uncertainty emerges through Elian's realization that "coincidence becomes pattern when viewed through the lens of time," but this arrives as explicit statement rather than dramatized discovery. The compass rose functions symbolically but its "key to navigating uncertain paths" remains abstract without showing how uncertainty actually challenges Elian.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The kintsugi theme elegantly connects brokenness to beauty, and the "weight of names" concept suggests deeper mysteries. The ending achieves thematic resonance by reframing failure as necessary to growth. However, the piece tends toward explicit theme statements ("true beauty lay not in perfection") rather than letting the metaphor emerge purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "luminous ache" and integration of "laughter into healing" appear as stated themes rather than emergent properties. The crocodile's tooth carries potential symbolic weight but functions mainly as narrative detail. The ending's assertion about "redemption" and "healing" lacks earned resonance through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of confronting trauma and finding redemption emerges but relies on abstract concepts that feel prompt-derived. "Mathematics of mercy" never gains concrete meaning through specific events. The ending's "sense of closure" and hope are asserted rather than earned through particular images or transformed understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme emerges through repetition of "overlooked histories" and "hidden details" but relies on abstract declarations. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about honoring the forgotten rather than embodying this through scene. "Anchors of intuition" remains conceptually vague without concrete manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of uncovering hidden stories beneath abandoned surfaces emerges through consistent imagery of cracks, dust patterns, and forgotten facades. However, it remains surface-level—the story tells us about "secrets hidden in cracks" rather than dramatizing how uncovering them transforms Ezra. The final meditation on carrying stories feels unearned without demonstrated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of eternity-as-depth rather than duration emerges through the whisper's message and the operator's project. However, the story tells us about transformation ("rustling awakenings that changed reality forever") rather than showing concrete particulars that embody this concept. The abstract philosophizing overwhelms scene-level resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme emerges through the transformation from revolutionary destruction to archaeological preservation, with the shard symbolizing fragments of lost meaning. However, the piece explicitly states its themes ("in times of uncertainty, humanity clung to whatever rituals brought comfort") rather than letting them arise from dramatized events, particularly in the overwrought final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges through the balance of "light and darkness," "sound and silence," but relies heavily on abstract mystical language rather than concrete dramatization. The concept of "mending what isn't torn" offers philosophical resonance but the story states rather than embodies this wisdom. The final image of maintained balance reads as assertion rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of seeking mystery beyond rational explanation emerges through the journey structure and culminates in the transcendent ending, though it risks abstraction with phrases like "where explanations fail." The petrichor collecting and psychometry create a consistent throughline about sensing hidden patterns. The final unity moment offers a non-literal answer but lacks the specificity and cost that would make it truly resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.6)
    The concept of "timewoven alliances" appears as abstract philosophizing ("the intricate web of connections that bound people, places, and objects") without earning resonance through concrete action. Heavy meta-commentary about meaning replaces scene pressure. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize about "hidden patterns and connections" rather than letting theme emerge from events.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of night/darkness revealing hidden beauty emerges through the cathedral window imagery and Luna's artistic transformation. The postcards-to-murals progression and the repeated moon/flower motif create coherent thematic texture. However, the ending's explicit statements ("she had finally begun to understand the secrets") undercut the subtlety, replacing earned resonance with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of memory, truth, and hidden histories emerges through the retrocognitive Ada and encrypted diary, but remains at the conceptual level without earning resonance through specific dramatized struggle. The beach debris messages suggest a language of the past but don't accumulate meaning. The ending asserts continued quest without thematic crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "reimagining civilization" versus "restoring former glory" offers conceptual depth but resolves through summary rather than dramatized particulars. The line "after the last wish is granted that true creation begins" gestures toward earned wisdom but lacks the specific experience that would ground it. The amber bottle suggests constraint but never pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of past influencing future emerges through the archiving process and dead languages, with the wax cylinder serving as a vessel for emotional patterns. However, the ending explicitly states the theme ("a reminder that the future was never set in stone") rather than letting it resonate through image and action. The prophecy concept remains abstract without concrete manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of cyclical responsibility emerges through the vortex visions and the seed saver's role as guardian, avoiding explicit moralizing until late passages about "decreasing entropy." The oak acorn cap accumulates meaning from simple object to inheritance key to symbol of connection. However, the story leans heavily on abstract concepts like "texture of borrowed time" without grounding them in specific dramatized moments, diluting potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of "listening over noise" emerges organically through Ember's actions, and the bell's resonance revealing weather patterns creates meaningful subtext. The ending image of Ember "at one with the solstice hush" resonates, though the insight feels somewhat predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme emerges through repetition of stillness/vulnerability/cosmic connection but lacks specificity or earned insight. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "primal elegance" and "the power of stillness and vulnerability" (-0.7), replacing scene work with direct thematic statements. No concrete experience generates the claimed wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of memory preservation against desolation emerges through the final image of the recluse as "sentinel guarding memories," with the stained glass box's glow serving as "beacon in the darkness." The contrast between decay and preserved beauty creates resonance, though the tangled covenant remains unexplored abstraction rather than integrated thematic element.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.2)
    Theme emerges primarily through abstract declarations about time and transformation rather than dramatized particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "discovery, growth, and understanding" instead of letting concrete images carry meaning. The cremation urn fragment and damaged capsule could build thematic resonance but remain ornamental rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in the incomplete emerges through the feather gift and woven dawn imagery, but resolution comes through direct assertion: "she knew that she had discovered something profound, a truth that would stay with her forever." The story tells us about connection and beauty rather than making us feel their weight through specific dramatized cost. The final image of the lagoon's "burnished hush" doesn't reweight earlier material with new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of harmony between humans and nature emerges clearly through the copper wire network and transformed orchard. However, it's delivered through explicit statements ("foster interspecies respect," "promote a deeper understanding") rather than earned through dramatized struggle. The ending merely restates the theme without complicating or deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstract concepts ("homecoming," "artificial pilgrimage," "convergence") but lacks grounding in specific dramatized events. The final paragraph explicitly states thematic conclusions ("redefine their perception") rather than letting them emerge from concrete action with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The regeneration theme emerges clearly through the land's transformation and "submerged concord" concept. However, the theme resolves too neatly—the final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("the power of dedication and the magic") rather than letting the image carry meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of finding life/hope in desolation emerges through concrete images (preserved leaf, hidden spring) rather than statement. However, the thematic resolution in the final paragraphs tilts toward explicit summary ("sense of purpose," "connected to something greater") rather than earned resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of transformation through stillness emerges but relies heavily on abstract statements ("catalyst for her journey," "potential for movement") rather than concrete particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "promise" and "renewal" instead of letting the image carry thematic weight through earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of restoration through sacred playfulness and wonder gets stated repeatedly but never tested through dramatic action. The story tells us about "creative solutions to complex problems" without showing any actual problem-solving under pressure. The ending's "world reborn" imagery lacks earned resonance because we never saw the world truly threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges through repetition ("unbind the past," "luminous absence," "small gestures") but remains abstract rather than arising from concrete dramatized struggle. The ending's suggestion of shaping the future lacks earned resonance because no specific past was actually unbound through action.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "buried talents" and hidden potential emerges through the search and transformation, though it remains somewhat abstract. "A time after remembering becomes painful" and "reality that substitutes reality nightly" offer intriguing concepts but don't cohere into a unified thematic statement. The ending's reality-seeding lacks specificity about what's being created or why.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.6)
    The forgiveness theme emerges clearly through the labyrinth-as-self metaphor and the journey from exile to peace, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic work remains abstract—"threads of time weaving themselves back together"—without specific dramatized moments that would make the insight feel earned rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    The forgiveness theme saturates the text but through direct statement rather than dramatized events. "Was it possible to forgive without forgetting?" reads as authorial intrusion, not earned insight. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize about "the price of forgiveness" and "the power of art" rather than letting scene work carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.6)
    The kintsugi theme (finding beauty in brokenness) appears explicitly through the mentor's philosophy but doesn't emerge from the action. The final paragraph's direct moralizing ("in the face of oblivion, she had found meaning") replaces earned resonance with thesis statement, violating the show-don't-tell principle at the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "temporary eternity" paradox emerges through repetition but lacks dramatized complexity. The theme of art outlasting the artist receives explicit statement ("the painter would be gone, but the art would remain") rather than arising from specific scene pressures. The "intimately aloof" balance gets named but not tested through action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    The whispers-versus-shouts theme emerges clearly but remains unearned philosophy since no dramatized event tests this belief. "Screaming tenderness" and "vibrations of intent" function as abstract concepts rather than embodied experience. The ending restates the theme without offering non-literal resonance through specific action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges through the patchwork navigator metaphor and culminates in "build a new life on the fragments of the old." However, the theme develops through exposition and assertion ("raw solace," "geography of loss") rather than dramatized particulars, though the censer foot provides some concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme emerges through heavy-handed statements ("fractured grace," "beautiful and broken") rather than dramatized particulars. The empathy virus critique remains conceptual without embodied scenes. Final moralizing about "balancing rational nature with fragile beauty" replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    The borrowed memories concept emerges through the lighthouse legend and creates thematic coherence around memory and isolation. However, the theme never develops through concrete action—it remains abstract speculation. The final image of Kael holding the boutonnière doesn't reweight prior material or offer insight beyond what was already stated.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme emerges primarily through repetition of concepts like "lingering promise" and "doorway of decisions" rather than through dramatized events. The father-daughter legacy thread offers potential resonance but resolves too neatly into fulfillment without exploring the complexity of inherited obligations. The final image of Emilia returning to her shop with "newfound purpose" feels unearned given the lack of genuine transformation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through bleeding starlight imagery and reality "fraying," but the story withholds all specifics. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("set her on a path from which there was no return") rather than allowing image to carry meaning. The piece gestures at cosmic horror or transformation but never commits to particulars that would make the theme resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding "density of presence" through careful observation has potential but relies heavily on abstract assertions like "subtle transformation" and "quiet alchemy." The nautilus spiral as embodiment of "palette of resolve" gestures toward meaning without grounding it in specific dramatized moments that would make the insight feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges too explicitly through repeated abstract declarations ("feral nostalgia," "distilled chaos into narrative") that feel like thesis statements. The final paragraph's moralizing about creativity and transformation replaces earned resonance with direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of "reading between the lines" and "unveiling ordinary miracles" is explicitly stated multiple times rather than emerging from events. The birthing clamp screw attempts symbolic weight but remains ornamental. Direct moralizing replaces dramatized meaning: "her work...was not just about healing, but about revealing the deeper truths."

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of transformation through artistic creation emerges clearly but relies on explicit statements like "transform the scars into stories" and "weight of his past slowly lifting." The runes-as-guides metaphor and the stillness/storm dichotomy provide thematic coherence, yet the piece explains its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge through dramatized struggle. The final image of stories drifting "into the unknown" offers resonance without earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "imperfect miracles" concept emerges through specific details like the perfume bottle's discovery and induced currents, avoiding direct thesis statements. However, the theme doesn't deepen through dramatized struggle—Lyra's insights about "subtle, often overlooked moments of connection" arrive fully formed rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of unity and balance emerges through repetition but lacks concrete dramatization. The "spiral arbitration" concept remains unexplored beyond being named, never showing how it actually resolves discord.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of time's nature emerges through repetition of clock imagery and the counting backwards method, but remains abstract without concrete dramatization. The piece gestures toward philosophical depth about measurement and perception but never earns insights through specific experience or struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of connection and boundaries emerges through repetition but never develops beyond abstract declaration. Lines like "navigating through permeable barriers" and "physics of letting go" remain conceptual placeholders without concrete dramatization. The ending moralizes explicitly ("she was ready to revolutionize the way people saw the world") rather than allowing theme to emerge from specific events.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme of "lucid contradictions" and gambling addiction emerges through reflection and the graffiti quote, but lacks embodied dramatization. The ending explicitly states the theme ("embrace paradoxes") rather than earning resonance through scene work. Subtext is absent—everything is articulated directly in Elara's thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme of connection through anonymity emerges but lacks concrete dramatization through specific events. The "cultivated estrangement" concept gets stated rather than embodied through actual scene work. Final paragraph explicitly moralizes about human connection rather than letting particulars resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of preserving memory emerges through repetition but lacks complexity or earned resonance. The story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("weight of small moments," "enduring power of love") rather than developing it through dramatized events. The final third devolves into pure thematic summary without scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    The loneliness-to-community theme emerges clearly but through direct statement ("the cure for loneliness was not a single event...") rather than earned resonance. The final image of Raven walking away offers some thematic closure but lacks the non-literal depth required for higher scores. The moon rock motif doesn't constrain choice or charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of navigating external terrain to understand internal landscape emerges through the journey structure, but relies heavily on direct statements ("journey to navigate the uncharted emotional depths"). The stillpoint revelation about "hidden harmonies" and finding one's place feels unearned without concrete struggle. The ending's "quiet blaze of knowledge" tells rather than embodies transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of restoring the pen and accepting failed attempts as necessary steps. The story effectively explores narrative power and responsibility without explicit moralizing. The final image of Aria as "guardian of this threshold" resonates meaningfully, reweighting the earlier failures as essential to her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of translating the unheard emerges organically through the convergence of sign language, the filmless camera, and the advisor's gift. The final image of the harbor "forever tuned to the frequency of their music" offers a non-literal answer to questions of memory and connection, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges through the concept of art transcending time and preserving memory, coherent with the archive setting. However, the thematic content relies heavily on abstract assertions ("transformative power of art," "human spirit") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The final paragraphs explicitly state the moral rather than letting it arise from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of connection through shared consciousness emerges through the imagery and Aria's experience, avoiding direct moralizing. The concept of "entangled memories" and collective dreaming resonates. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level, with abstract notions of connection that don't wrestle with specific human complexity or meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.6)
    The whispers-versus-shouts concept offers potential but remains abstract, never dramatized through specific action with cost. The labyrinth-as-hidden-world theme emerges through maps and coins but doesn't develop beyond suggestion. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("quietest voices traveled the farthest") rather than earning it through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=2.8)
    "Silent empathy" and "teach darkness the value of stars" exist as prompt labels without scene embodiment. The story tells us about connection without showing what connects these characters or why. Theme remains abstract assertion rather than emerging from dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "forests of second thoughts" metaphor carries thematic weight about reflection and pause, emerging from the accumulative structure. However, the theme reduces to simplistic transformation-through-contemplation without exploring complexity or counter-arguments; everyone instantly embraces the change.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.6)
    The disappearing island as "not a place, but a state of being" offers thematic resonance about internal freedom, and the scrimshaw's transformation from artifact to glowing guide supports this. However, the theme relies heavily on abstract statements ("freedom that lay just beyond the reaches of her former self") rather than emerging through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "cultivating lightness in grief" emerges through the dried flowers and Echo's performances, but relies heavily on abstract statements ("remade hush," "fragile peace") rather than earned resonance.

The ending explicitly states themes about "possibility" rather than letting them emerge from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of artistic transcendence through boundary dissolution emerges through imagery but remains abstract without concrete dramatization. The piece gestures toward transformation but offers no specific insight beyond "art transcends limitations"—a platitude without earned wisdom from particular struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.0)
    The imperfection-as-beauty theme emerges clearly but through direct statement ("the beauty of imperfection was being redefined") rather than earned revelation. The concertina reed tongue attempts symbolic weight but lacks causal integration. Final paragraphs explicitly moralize about "the power of imperfection" instead of letting image and action carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme emerges through the motif of connection and hidden patterns, but remains abstract without concrete dramatization. The piece tells us about "profound sense of unity" and "ever-deepening understanding" without showing specific discoveries that cost something. The abrupt meta-ending undermines any thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of renewal through craft emerges clearly through imagery (the flower tattoo stencil showing stages of bloom) and the jewelry-making metaphor. However, the transformation happens without earned wisdom from specific experience—the maker's "subdued ardor" rekindles automatically when the curtains glow. The ending states rather than dramatizes the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme emerges through repetitive meditation on "hidden patterns" and "inherited mystery" but never develops beyond abstract assertion.

The final image offers no resonant answer to any central question, merely restating the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "atoms of nostalgia" concept creates poetic resonance but remains abstract metaphor rather than dramatized theme. The story tells us about "anguished joy" and transformation but doesn't earn these insights through specific experience. The ending's claim about "deeper understanding of the human experience" reads as authorial assertion rather than emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the shadow/hope dichotomy and collective unconscious exploration. The river stone and luminescent imagery create coherent motifs. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement ("beacon of hope in a world where shadows lurked") rather than letting image carry meaning. The metamorphosis concept gets stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges only through repetitive abstract statements about "shedding layers," "balance," and "reconstruction" without dramatized particulars. The chameleon's ability to change provides obvious symbolism but lacks subtlety. Final paragraph moralizing about finding "peace and purpose" replaces earned resonance with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of seeking hidden narratives emerges through coffee rings and scars, but relies heavily on abstract statements ("displaced miracle," "tissue of reality") rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "unused love" and "goodbye letters" remains abstract, never grounding in specific human particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("a testament to the power of love and memory") rather than letting imagery resonate. The piece tells its theme rather than embodying it through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The creativity-freedom theme emerges through repetition but lacks complexity or earned insight. The story presents a simplistic equation where cosmic connection automatically unlocks creativity, avoiding the messy reality of creative struggle or the costs of artistic pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of rebirth from destruction ("after the last forest burns") emerges through the glowing dune and cultivated sparks, with the chess clock suggesting disrupted time. However, the abstract language ("fractured lullaby," "kaleidoscope") and reversal of the merger undercut thematic resonance—what specific wisdom does Asa gain?

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of consciousness expansion and frontier exploration emerges through the mechanical/organic hybrid and translocation imagery. However, it resolves into abstract statements like "probable miracles" and "infinite possibilities" without earned specificity. The gear motif recurs but doesn't accumulate meaning or constrain choice. Final paragraphs drift toward philosophical generality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of courage, transformation, and journey motifs but lacks specificity. The star stamp symbol and "unused courage" concept gesture toward meaning without earning resonance through particular struggle. The ending's "threshold of a new world" remains conceptually vague rather than offering a non-literal answer to what unused courage actually means.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cost of safety theme emerges clearly through the silence/identity tension and finds resonance in "frostbitten hope." However, the theme develops through abstract contemplation rather than embodied scene work. The final assertion about "strength that lay within" feels unearned without dramatized testing.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of "truth" versus "duplicity" but lacks complexity—the pretender has no compelling position, no gray area. The ending attempts resonance with "beacon shining brightly" but feels unearned after such abstract conflict. The story tells us about power and dedication without dramatizing their collision.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of listening to natural rhythms versus relying on data emerges through repetition and accumulation, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, lines like "she was not just a witness...but a part of the ocean's own story" edge toward theme-summary. The drum-as-communication motif resonates but doesn't constrain choices or exact cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the journey from stillness to renewed purpose, but remains abstract. The stone circle's "thunderous serenity" and the opera glasses as symbols of perspective feel mechanically placed rather than organically integrated. The ending's promise of future action substitutes for present-scene resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of "evolving tradition with intent" emerges through the reconstruction context and Akira's insurgent past meeting mystical future. However, the final paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("forge a new path that honored the past while embracing the future") rather than letting it emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding stillness within chaos emerges through concrete imagery (twisted trees, pearl metaphor, smooth photograph) rather than statement. The final image of Amira walking away "quietly talented at finding solace" creates resonance without moralizing, and the arboretum's transformation from tortured to sanctuary embodies the thematic journey.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fragmentation-to-wholeness theme emerges organically through the broken tarot box mirroring the artist's fractured perception, with the untangling revealing "hidden patterns" and interconnection. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, letting the metaphor of darkness as creative necessity resonate. However, the thematic work stays conceptual rather than arising from dramatized struggle, and the "luminescent ache" phrase risks abstraction over earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges only through direct statement about "time's slowing" and "patterns that governed the world." The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("the world at peace") rather than earning resonance through particulars. No subtext operates beneath the surface declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of silenced truths versus comfortable ignorance emerges clearly through the accumulative imagery. However, the resolution feels predetermined—Aria succeeds completely in her goal without exploring the complexity of why truths were hidden or what specific damage their revelation causes.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of cultivating peace amid chaos emerges clearly through the contrast of sanctuary and devastation. The "engraved quiet" stone and repurposed wreckage suggest transformation of violence into growth. However, the theme arrives pre-resolved without being tested through dramatized struggle, and the final paragraphs drift toward explicit moralizing about finding one's "true calling."

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of seeking the divine through silence and patient attention emerges organically from the fisher's journey. The concept that the goddess speaks "in the silences between words" offers a non-literal meditation on spiritual seeking. However, the resolution—fisher finds what she seeks and leaves "renewed"—lacks complexity or ambiguity, presenting spiritual fulfillment without examining its cost or limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme of hidden truths and family legacy emerges through repetition but lacks embodied complexity. The pen nib's symbolic weight feels imposed rather than earned through action. Final moralizing about "freeing her family from orbits of regret" replaces scene pressure with abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of confronting past guilt through art emerges but relies on explicit statements ("by confronting it, she had begun to heal") rather than dramatized revelation. The final moralizing about "complexities of the human heart" replaces earned resonance with thesis declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstract phrases ("emergent hush," "lilac unease," "meaning in the mess") that lack concrete dramatization. The ending tells us she "discovered meaning" without showing what specific meaning arose from her experience or how it reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "aberrant mercy" emerges through Aria's determination to find compassion amid devastation, with the tessera serving as a concrete anchor for abstract hope. The concept of renaming as rebirth offers thematic resonance but tends toward explicit declaration ("to redefine the very essence of the plaza"). The final image of Aria as "testament to the transformative power of aberrant mercy" states rather than embodies the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of fragmented memory and the search for coherence emerges through repetition and imagery. However, the story relies on explicit statements like "the power of nostalgia" and "the possibility of redemption" rather than allowing theme to arise from concrete particulars. The final image gestures toward resonance but lacks the specificity to achieve genuine depth.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.4)

The ending's contentment feels unearned rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "shared wisdom" and time's patterns emerges through accumulated imagery of hourglasses, buttons, and echoes. However, it develops through direct philosophical statements ("transmuting the raw material of the past") rather than dramatized events. The final image attempts resonance but lacks the concrete particulars and earned cost that would make the wisdom feel lived rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of mending what's broken emerges clearly but resolves too tidily into self-integration. The burned skin serves as obvious metaphor for damage without complexity. The final image of "unused courage waits" directly states the theme rather than embodying it through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the needle-work metaphor and ideas of distilling complexity, but relies heavily on abstract statements ("distill complexity into essence," "palimpsest promise"). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "spindrift serenity, suspended in time" rather than earning resonance through dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of resistance to change through kindness emerges too explicitly in direct statements like "some places resist change because they are infused with the kindness." The final paragraph's assertion that Akira "would carry the lessons" commits thematic echo without dramatizing what those lessons cost her.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme operates through heavy abstraction about light/darkness and hidden corners without concrete dramatization. The lockmaster parallel attempts depth but lacks scene-level manifestation. Final paragraphs explicitly state theme ("guardian of the city's beauty") rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of preserving knowledge while forging independence emerges through setting and concept but lacks dramatization. "Brittle awakenings" appears five times but never moves beyond abstract meditation to concrete scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme emerges through heavy abstraction about connection and hidden patterns, culminating in explicit moralizing: "the thread she had been seeking was not something to be found, but something to be created." The thrush's nest spiral attempts symbolic resonance but remains ornamental, never constraining choice or accumulating genuine meaning through action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme remains at surface level—"outwitting cosmic tricksters" and "restoring balance to the universe" read as generic abstractions without earned resonance from particulars. The final paragraphs drift into explicit moralizing ("she had found her true calling") rather than allowing theme to emerge from concrete action. No subtext operates beneath the straightforward narrative of problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of discovery transforming perception emerges through the journey from darkness to starlight, but relies heavily on abstract statements like "profound insight into the underlying structure of the universe." The wistful rebellion at leaving lacks earned emotional weight since no real attachment was built.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of dual identity and hidden truths emerges through the masquerade fragment and face-blind portraiture metaphor. However, the explicit statements about empathy and understanding in the final paragraphs ("the truth they had been seeking was not just about solving cases, but about understanding themselves") replace earned resonance with direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme of uncovering hidden patterns and honoring forgotten ancestors emerges through repetition but lacks specificity. The "reversible exile" concept gestures toward interesting territory about displacement but never develops beyond mysterious suggestion.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme emerges only through direct abstract statements about "transformation," "redemption," and "possibility from ashes" rather than through dramatized events. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize about the "power of art" instead of letting action carry meaning. No concrete particulars support the thematic claims.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of circular paths versus dead ends emerges organically through the train metaphor and Kael's startup experience. The foreign money collection serves as a concrete symbol of diverse paths. However, the piece occasionally states its theme too directly ("the value of a journey lay not in its destination, but in the stories it told"), undermining subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "shared burdens" theme is explicitly stated numerous times but never embodied through specific dramatized events or images that would let it emerge naturally. The final paragraph's assertion that "the world seemed a little brighter" attempts thematic resolution through declaration rather than earned resonance. The daylily-pressed telegram hints at deeper meaning but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme about hidden truths and perception emerges primarily through direct statement: "What mirrors don't show...was not a physical reflection, but a glimpse into the soul." The story repeatedly tells us about expanding perception and embracing chaos but doesn't dramatize these concepts through concrete action. The flesh-eating plant seed appears as a potential thematic element but never develops beyond mention.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of "hidden patterns" and "possibilities" but remains abstract. The "eclipsed covenant" shifts from "forgotten promise" to "hidden blueprint" without earning this reinterpretation through specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transformation through confronting inner darkness emerges through the burned tarot card symbol and spell-weaving, avoiding explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of finding purpose after loss emerges through repetition ("echo valley longing," memories vs. present) but resolves into abstract assertions: "sometimes, it's in the quiet moments that we find our true voice." The final pages resort to explicit moralizing rather than earned resonance. The speaker grille cloth's symbolic weight feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges clearly through the integration of tidal rhythms, migrating identity, and cyclical time, with the bamboo creel serving as a concrete anchor. However, without dramatic action or cost, the thematic resonance remains purely conceptual rather than earned through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through heavy-handed metaphor about connection and inner light, culminating in explicit moralizing: "the power to connect with others lay within, waiting to be uncovered." The final paragraph states the theme directly rather than allowing it to emerge from dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of forgiveness as journey emerges through the graffiti wisdom and map references metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic work leans heavily on stated connections ("Forgiveness is a path, not a destination") rather than arising implicitly from dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of unspoken words/hidden knowledge emerges but resolves into platitude: the library isn't a place but "a state of being." The story tells us the dreamer is "forever changed" without showing specific transformation. The recurring mist and veil imagery creates some coherence, but the final "revelation" reads as unearned wisdom rather than insight arising from concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme relies on abstract concepts like "perforated destiny" that never gain specific meaning through dramatized events. The notion of fate-altering through the violin remains unexplored conceptually. Final paragraph attempts thematic weight through assertion rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of beauty persisting beyond death emerges through the aurora-infused emerald as "beacon of hope and transcendence." However, the piece relies heavily on abstract declarations ("mystery that lay at the heart of all things") rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.4)
    The cycle of rebirth theme remains abstract exposition rather than emerging from concrete events. The hairpin's "significance" is asserted but never demonstrated through action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "welcoming nuance into certainty" emerges clearly but through direct statement rather than dramatized particulars. The mirror's brief self-reflection moment gestures toward complexity but doesn't develop.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The vanishing/appearing paradox and delayed revelation concept resonate through pond ripples and teaching method. Theme emerges from accumulating patterns rather than stated morals.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme of stillness-as-movement and harmony with ancient rhythms emerges through repetition but lacks complexity or earned insight. The piece tells us about "transformative power of stillness" and "beauty and wonder" rather than dramatizing these through specific experience. No subtext operates beneath the surface meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of creativity versus automation emerges through the spire's preserved beauty and Eira's search, avoiding explicit moralizing until near the end. The garden as repository of lost creative power resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden knowledge emerges through the recurring motif of light (lanterns, luminous vows, color of sound) and the physical descent mirroring intellectual deepening.

However, the final paragraph's explicit statements ("doorway to a new understanding") replace earned thematic weight with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.4)
    Theme emerges only through repetitive abstract assertions about cosmic understanding and purpose alignment.

No subtext operates beneath the surface declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of sacrifice and memory emerges through the recurring motifs of echoes, lost love, and ancient mariners, avoiding direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The brittle devotion theme emerges through the bell's repair as metaphor for faith's restoration, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the empty viaduct as "monument to rebuilding" offers resonance. However, the theme lacks complexity - no counter-reading emerges, and the mage's success feels too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.6)

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of mystery-as-creative-catalyst emerges through repetition but lacks depth or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "tending to the unspoken" emerges through the musical healing but remains conceptually thin.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "rational enchantment" emerges consistently through the interplay of logic and magic in the gallery space.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of remembering forgotten researchers emerges through direct statement rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.6)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of "where broken promises heal" remains abstract philosophy disconnected from concrete action—we never see what promise was broken or how this delivery heals it. The thunderstorm-in-bottle suggests containment versus release but this potential remains unexplored. Final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("unleashing a different kind of tempest—one of hope and redemption") rather than letting it emerge from events.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding beauty in silence emerges through repetition of "misting hush" and the singer encounter, but resolves into comfortable affirmation without complexity. The final lines explicitly state the theme ("cradle of creativity," "power of silence") rather than letting it emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.4)

The final paragraphs explicitly moralize rather than resonating through image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of accumulated silence bringing peace emerges through the central action and imagery. The tapestry needle as tool for exhuming secrets offers resonance. However, the piece states its meaning too directly ("testament to her craft," "bringing them peace") rather than allowing complexity to emerge through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme emerges weakly through abstract assertions about "mysteries hidden in plain sight" and "listening to silence" but lacks concrete dramatization. The story tells us Elara interprets "silence with empathy" without showing how this manifests in specific choices. The ending's claim about finding "a piece of herself" reads as unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "letting go" emerges through accumulated details but resolves into abstract philosophy: "to let go is not to release, but to reframe." The story explicitly states its thesis multiple times, particularly in the final paragraphs where Eli directly articulates insights about "embracing the fluidity of existence." The snow globe's symbolism feels convenient rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme of communication with the ineffable emerges through the ghost-code concept but resolves into explicit statement: "testament to the power of creative expression." The final paragraph moralizes rather than allowing resonance to arise from particulars. Subtext operates minimally beyond atmospheric suggestion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding "joy beneath anguish" emerges through the diary's love story, but resolution comes too easily through abstract appreciation. The final insight about connection lacks earned complexity—no genuine anguish tests Elara's pursuit of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding wholeness in turbulence emerges through repetition of concepts like "spooled wholeness" and "empty spaces remembered," but these remain abstract assertions rather than dramatized truths. The ending's "sense of peace" offers no resonant answer to any central question posed.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of capturing infinity within finite bounds emerges through the portrait work and impending destruction, avoiding direct statement. The coin's message about "limits of human understanding" connects but feels abstractly philosophical. The final image of the portrait glowing with "otherworldly light" provides resonance but the conceptual cost remains oblique rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of discovery and hidden knowledge emerges through concrete actions—decoding patterns, charting luminance, keeping secrets. The "sociable isolation" paradox ("alone, yet connected to the world through their work") adds thematic texture. However, the ending doesn't offer a resonant non-literal answer to what discovery means or costs; it remains at the threshold without deeper implication.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of understanding universal harmonies through patient craft emerges through the clockwork imagery and mirror reflections, avoiding direct statement. The recurring gear motif connects discovery to comprehension, and "driftwood nostalgia" creates tonal coherence. However, the final insight that "craft was not just about repair, but about understanding the intricate dance of the universe" edges toward abstract philosophy without grounding in specific cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme emerges only through explicit statements about "collective effort" and "belonging" rather than through dramatized particulars. The butterfly garden attempts symbolic weight but never transcends decoration. The ending celebrates transformation without showing what was sacrificed or lost—no complexity or ambiguity challenges the straightforward message of communal harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of fragility and balance emerges through the broken puppet head and clockwork imagery, but remains surface-level without complexity or earned insight. The story tells us about "beautifully flawed" existence but doesn't dramatize this paradox through specific events that would make it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme emerges through the transformation from curse to blessing, with the labyrinth shifting from "symbol of danger" to "beacon of hope." The small nut serves as a catalyst connecting past to present. However, the resolution feels too neat, lacking complexity or ambiguity that would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    The transformation metaphor (chrysalis/polymer networks/braided waterways) creates thematic coherence about interconnection versus separation. The final image of walking away with "melody lingering" offers resonance. However, the theme emerges through explicit reflection ("her work was not just about creating new materials, but about translating the separation") rather than dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of hidden narratives woven into place emerges clearly but mechanically, stated directly: "The stories...were not just contained within the books...but were also woven into the very fabric of the library itself." This explicit articulation replaces earned resonance, and the ending's assertion of "belonging" and "purpose" feels unearned without demonstrated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transforming pain through culinary/sensory metaphor emerges through "sandpapering rough memories" and tasting the past. The fortress as repository of remorse creates symbolic resonance. However, the resolution—that smoothed memories "would no longer be a source of pain"—presents transformation without complexity or ambiguity about whether erasing rough edges diminishes truth.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of connection and unity emerges through repetitive abstract statements about "bridging silos" and "fostering unity" rather than through specific dramatized events. The story tells its theme explicitly in passages like "construct bridges from silos" without earning resonance through particular actions. The final paragraph commits thematic echo with "vigorous tender hope" that restates the prompt rather than arising from scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of "abandoned dreams" emerges through repetition but lacks specificity—we learn only that past occupants experienced "love, loss, and longing" without concrete particulars. The concept of entangled memories remains unexplored beyond surface mentions. Final paragraphs explicitly state theme ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The serpent/seed motif connects manuscript to grotto discovery, and "seeds of vigilance" suggests themes of watchfulness and growth. However, the theme never complexifies beyond surface metaphor. The ending states rather than dramatizes meaning: "the seeds of vigilance would continue to guide her" reads as thesis summary.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of empathy through art emerges through the sculptor's craft and the metaphor of music in silence. The mysterious "hedgehog uncurled" event adds intrigue. However, the theme remains surface-level without complexity—the sculptor's success is assured, and no counter-position challenges the premise that art can heal.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges through repetition ("beauty in the difficult," "translate silence") but never develops beyond initial assertion. The final image of the tutor vanishing offers no resonant answer to any central question. Heavy reliance on abstract concepts ("hidden patterns," "inner truth") without grounding in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of empathy and understanding silence emerges through Lyra's poetry and Elara's reflection, but lacks complexity or earned insight. The violation of reading a friend's private diary without permission contradicts the supposed empathy theme without acknowledging this irony. Final paragraph moralizing about "lessons" and "purpose" replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of finding wisdom through patient observation emerges through Lyra's journaling and doodling practice, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the "undercurrent of wisdom" reads as conceptual abstraction rather than emerging from concrete particulars, and the vendor's explanation front-loads meaning rather than letting it accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "gathering of echoes" as both phenomenon and metaphor for planetary resilience offers thematic coherence. The "whirling silence" paradox and the orchard's adaptation to harsh conditions suggest themes of resilience through harmony. However, the ending states rather than embodies this wisdom: "she would never see the orchard - or the universe - in the same way again."

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme remains abstract—"cultivation of foresight in action" and "complex interplay of factors" are corporate-speak without embodied meaning. The patch gestures toward human cost but never develops. Final paragraph moralizing ("The crash would not be forgotten") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of "wonder as essential" emerges through abstract declaration rather than dramatized particulars. The concept of "sculpted hush" offers poetic potential but remains unexplored beyond metaphorical gestures. The final assertion that Elian "succeeded in certifying wonder" tells rather than demonstrates this thematic victory through earned scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of harvesting wisdom from failure emerges through the keeper's reflection on "triumphs and failures" and the flute as key to "unlocking mysteries." The recurring motifs of silence/sound and the driftwood markers create some resonance. However, the insights gained remain abstract without specific dramatized wisdom, and the final image of waiting markers and silent flute offers atmosphere more than a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of translating emotion through language/symbol emerges clearly through Echo's letterpress work and the "maze of deliberate ambiguity." The concept of "transposed empathy" integrates well with the action. However, the ending's assertion that "the true work was just beginning" deflates rather than crystallizes the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of finding magic beneath everyday life emerges through repetition rather than earned revelation. The story tells us about "coaxing wonder" and "nurturing connection" but doesn't dramatize these concepts through specific struggle or choice. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("keep the spark of wonder alive") rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete action—a −0.6 deduction for moralizing that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme emerges through repetition of abstract concepts ("hidden connections," "truthful lies") rather than dramatized events. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "the power of the unknown" instead of letting scene work carry meaning. The paradox of "truthful lies" remains unexplored conceptually—what specific lie reveals what specific truth?

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges through repetition of connection/separation imagery but remains surface-level. The story tells us about "the power of love and determination" in the final lines rather than demonstrating it through earned action. The amber bead and puzzle serve as symbols but don't complicate or deepen the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.6)
    The transformation theme emerges through repetitive metaphors (phoenix, rubble to resilience) but lacks specificity - what exactly transforms and at what cost? "Azure defiance" appears as a label without earned resonance. The final image of "shaping our own destiny" reads as generic theme statement rather than emergent meaning from concrete events.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of "withheld truth" never develops beyond its initial declaration. The story ends with abstract assertions about understanding the multiverse differently without showing what specific truth was discovered or why it matters. Line 23: "she knew that she would never see the multiverse in the same way again" exemplifies the hollow thematic claims.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "luminescent ache" beautifully captures the story's thematic core—the burden and beauty of guardianship. The final image of the skipper sailing into darkness while the lighthouse stands sentinel resonates without stating its meaning. The cairn ritual adds textural depth to the theme of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme emerges through repetition of light/shadow imagery and the contrast between ancient traditions and digital modernity, but remains surface-level. The piece asserts profound significance ("shaping the day to come") without dramatizing what this means concretely. Final paragraph moralizing about "enduring power of ancient traditions" replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of how certain people "magnetize stories" emerges through explicit statement rather than dramatized particulars. The blue morpho wing serves as a somewhat effective metaphor for this quality, but the final paragraphs resort to direct thematic exposition ("The stories that people told...were connected to the intricate patterns") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of healing and understanding broken things emerges through the central action, but resolution defaults to abstract statements ("mundane miracles," "machinery of the universe"). The final pages abandon scene pressure for philosophical musing. The story tells us about interconnection rather than demonstrating it through specific dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetitive assertion about "woven dawns" and "connections between people" but lacks concrete dramatization. The metaphor of knitting communities through shared stories receives abstract treatment rather than specific embodiment. The ending moralizes about hope and connection without earning resonance through particular struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.1)
    The paradox theme emerges clearly through "staying while leaving" and truth within questions, but relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements. The final paragraph's explicit articulation ("the truth is not in the destination, but in the journey itself") replaces earned resonance with direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding "sacred in the ordinary" emerges through repetition but lacks complexity or earned insight. The bread symbolism feels convenient rather than organic, and the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("most profound truths are found in the most ordinary of things") rather than letting it emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving meaning against oblivion emerges through the premise, but relies heavily on abstract statements ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") rather than dramatized particulars. The luminous vows concept carries thematic weight but never manifests in specific scene pressure or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of hidden truths and fragile trust emerges through the market's atmosphere and secretive exchanges but resolves into abstract "complexities" and "secrets beneath the surface." The watch fob carries potential thematic weight about family history but its significance never develops beyond a MacGuffin. Final paragraph explicitly states themes rather than allowing them to emerge from events.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of bridging scientific skepticism with mystical understanding emerges through imagery and repetition, particularly the weather-carriers motif. However, the resolution offers no complexity - Aria simply gains "understanding" without wrestling with contradictions, and the final "futuristic nostalgia" feels more like labeled emotion than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of creative unlocking emerges through the lock metaphor and portrait creation, with some resonance in the cave's response to artistic expression. However, the thematic resolution feels tidy—creativity simply flows when one decides to create. The final paragraph explicitly states the lesson ("it takes a journey into the depths to uncover the true depths") rather than letting the image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving intimate truth emerges through Aria's art where "ink wilts near dishonesty" and her search for lost conversations. However, this remains conceptual rather than dramatized - the story tells us about candor's value without showing its cost. The ending's "candor of small moments" restates rather than deepens the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme of transcending verbal communication emerges through repetition rather than dramatization. Phrases like "symphonies of truth" and "the language of the heart" appear frequently but remain abstract concepts without concrete embodiment. The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from events.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of finding wholeness through accepting fragmentation emerges through the fire's transformation of the landscape, though it's undermined by explicit statements like "fragmented wholeness" appearing five times. The controlled burn as metaphor for internal renewal works conceptually but lacks the specificity that would make it resonate beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "listening heals" theme is explicitly stated multiple times rather than emerging from dramatized events. The locket's "forever" inscription and the writer's healing-through-letters provide thematic furniture, but the connection feels manufactured. The final display case note ("To those who listen, stories unfold") substitutes platitude for earned resonance. Theme operates at the surface level of declared meaning rather than embodied truth.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.0)
    The spider's web metaphor and the dice-as-fate concept offer thematic potential about pattern-making and control. However, these remain surface observations rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. The ending's "calm defiance" and "mysterious familiarity" feel like prompt-echo rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of memory recovery emerges through the pressed wildflowers and crystalline structures, but resolves too neatly when memories return intact. The ending line about "secrets to uncover" and "the journey was far from over" deflates rather than deepens the thematic question. Subtext operates weakly; the story states its meanings rather than implying them through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges somewhat through the silence/tranquility motif but remains surface-level without complexity. The crane's origami wing suggests fragility versus permanence but doesn't develop beyond decorative symbolism. The ending assertion that "the world was a little more at peace" tells rather than demonstrates thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "agreed upon lies" and hidden knowledge emerges through the concept of dead languages and old buildings holding secrets. The final image of the glowing seal attempts resonance but relies on telling ("symbol of the secrets") rather than earned transformation. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy mentorship without exploring the darker implications of hidden truths.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of isolation versus independence emerges but relies heavily on abstract statements ("memory of forgotten memories," "journey from isolation to independence"). The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete events. The seashell functions as a convenient catalyst without earning its symbolic weight through specific dramatized moments.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transformation and rewriting history emerges through the forgery act, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the concept remains abstract—"revealing deeper truth" and "creating new reality" lack specific dramatized discovery. The heritage rose thorn attempts symbolic resonance but doesn't accumulate meaning or constrain choice. Final peace arrives without earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The echo metaphor and musical imagery create thematic coherence around connection and hidden truths. However, the theme relies on abstract statements like "threads of truth into a narrative that was both personal and universal" rather than emerging from concrete dramatized moments. The ending attempts resonance but lacks the specific cost that would charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "windows of connection" theme emerges through imagery but never develops through concrete events that test or complicate it. The piece gestures toward complexity ("fragments of dreams that had been lost or forgotten") but doesn't dramatize any specific moral calculus or meaningful ambiguity. The ending offers no resonant answer to any central question, merely atmospheric fade-out.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of hidden patterns emerges through consistent imagery but resolves into abstract assertion: "she had finally grasped the truth she had been seeking." The story tells us about profound understanding without showing what specifically was understood or why it matters. Thematic echo appears in "hidden patterns" repetition without earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme of "excavating truth from comfortable lies" is stated directly but never dramatized through specific struggle or discovery. The liquidation as "carefully orchestrated event" hints at conspiracy but remains abstract exposition. The ending's "new reality" threshold lacks thematic resonance because no specific truth was uncovered or lie confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges through the "variant allegiance" concept and shadow/light imagery, but remains abstract without concrete dramatization. The story tells us about transformation and "shaping a new dawn" but never shows specific moments where these themes generate actual cost or choice. Final paragraph moralizing ("beacon of hope in a world forever changed") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving beauty across generations emerges through the glass jars and the poet's role as "translator," avoiding direct moralizing. However, the thematic resolution feels unearned when he smiles about his "lonesome splendor" without having paid any price for this wisdom. The final image of facing "all its possibilities" reads as generic optimism rather than resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of harmony between sound and physical world emerges through the vibrational matching process and recurring sonic imagery. The concept of "sonic absolution" gestures toward deeper meaning about resonance and protection but remains underdeveloped. The final image of the lighthouse as beacon connects thematically but doesn't offer a non-literal answer to what sonic absolution actually means or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.4)
    Theme emerges only through direct statement ("patient revolution," "unyoke themselves," "new era of freedom") rather than dramatized events. The central concept of "sculpting patience from impatience" is declared but never embodied through specific struggle. The ending offers no resonant answer because no genuine question was posed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    The freedom/confinement theme emerges through the underground railroad metaphor and "Free at last" inscription, but relies heavily on stated connections rather than dramatized discovery. The thematic echo in "break free from the controlling influence" reads as prompt language rather than earned insight. The final image attempts resonance but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    The clockwork heart metaphor for human emotion and redemption provides thematic coherence, and the parallel between mechanical repair and spiritual renewal resonates. However, the theme emerges through explicit commentary ("by the way light breaks through storm clouds") rather than dramatized action. The ending's promise to "turn apologies into action" states the moral rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.8)
    The yearning algorithm concept emerges through accumulation rather than direct statement, and the kaleidoscope-as-translator motif recurs effectively. However, the thematic resolution ("power of curiosity") feels unearned without struggle, and the final image doesn't reweight prior material with new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of absence/presence emerges through the archive metaphor and Lena's personal void, with the recurring numbers serving as "ghostly signatures." However, the resolution that files are "simply archived, waiting to be rediscovered" offers comfort without complexity. The final paragraphs explicitly state theme ("mysteries that lay just beyond the edge of perception") rather than letting it emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges through the crystal reconstitution process and the peacekeeper's role as balance-keeper. The final image of the landscape sighing "a soft exhalation" resonates with the established pattern, though the story occasionally veers toward explicit statement ("mapping of empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of impermanence emerges through ice imagery and "approaching endings," avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the resolution into "cherish every moment" feels somewhat generic, and the repeated abstractions about fragility and beauty don't achieve the concrete particularity that would elevate the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "destined mismatches" theme emerges through vineyard imagery (mismatched fruit creating complex harvest) and connects to the love letter's content. However, the theme resolves into comfortable abstraction about "complexity" and "profound beauty" without earned specificity or genuine ambiguity. The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme rather than letting it emerge from dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of preserving wisdom remains surface-level, never complicated by specific cost or contradiction. The story tells us about "echo of wisdom" repeatedly without showing what specific wisdom matters or why preserving it requires sacrifice. The ending simply restates the opening intention without transformation or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.6)
    The healing-through-art theme emerges but remains unearned through abstract declaration rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of knowledge versus isolation emerges through the scholar's dilemma and the post-dictionary world setting. The crystal serves as a resonant motif for contemplation and determination.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of aging and memory emerges through fog, worn statues, and "old videotapes left unwatched," but resolves into abstract assertion: "The sound of growing older was not something to be found, but something to be felt."

The final paragraphs explicitly moralize about finding peace and resolution without dramatizing how this wisdom was earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of transcendence and capturing ephemeral moments emerges through abstract statements rather than concrete dramatization. The clock hand's symbolism as "the universe's underlying order" is declared rather than earned through specific experience. The ending's philosophical realization about "escape velocity" and "transcending limitations" reads as unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of music transcending death emerges through repetition but lacks complexity—no counter-reading is possible, no ambiguity complicates the message. The "scent of hope" metaphor appears without earning its significance through concrete action. The final image doesn't reweight prior material or offer a non-literal answer to any central question beyond "music soothes dying patients."

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme of "sealed awakenings" and hidden knowledge remains abstract philosophy without concrete dramatization. The clockwork key metaphor is stated directly rather than emerging from events. Final lines assert thematic significance without earning it through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through heavy abstraction and direct statement ("turning mistakes into constellations") rather than dramatized particulars. The final paragraphs resort to explicit moralizing about "transformative power" instead of earned resonance. The changeling tooth's symbolic weight is asserted rather than built through scene work. Nostalgia and innovation are told as concepts without embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.6)
    The "pearl of stillness" theme is explicit rather than emergent, with the narrator directly stating its significance multiple times. The concept never develops through concrete conflict or cost. The ending's "pearl of tranquility" merely echoes the opening without reweighting or transforming the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstractions about healing, vulnerability, and new beginnings but lacks concrete dramatization. The amber pendant and moss garden carry symbolic weight without constraining choice or accumulating specific meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of reconnection through forgotten traditions emerges but relies on direct statement ("restore the sacred practices") rather than dramatized discovery. The harvest moon functions as nostalgic backdrop without charging specific choices. Final paragraph explicitly moralizes about community rather than letting image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of patience and transformation emerges through the methodical pattern-making and eventual success, but relies on explicit statements like "cartographer of the soul" and "the magic that unfolded while the world held its breath." The safekept starlight concept carries symbolic weight yet doesn't complicate Aria's choices. The ending's "beacon in the frozen wilderness" image gestures toward meaning without earning resonance through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "harvest of echoes" and "cellar of reason" concepts suggest thematic depth about preserving wonder through understanding, but these remain abstract assertions. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("stored safely in the cellar of reason") rather than embodying it through dramatized action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme of measuring burdens and finding balance remains surface-level, expressed through direct statements like "the delicate balance that governed the world" rather than emerging from specific events.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of containment versus confrontation emerges through the carving process and the "here and gone" meditation, with the final image of "rust-hued peace" offering a non-literal answer about finding ways to live with loss. However, the thematic resolution feels too tidy—the widow achieves peace without visible struggle or ambiguity, and phrases like "harvest lessons from her loss" edge toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of memory, loss, and the stories we tell ourselves emerges organically through the accumulation of fragments. The halted carousel serves as an effective metaphor for arrested time.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of "renewal and hope" emerges through explicit statements ("equations for hope") rather than dramatized struggle. The final moralizing about "the power of hope and creativity" replaces earned resonance with direct thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of reconciling past dreams with present reality emerges clearly but through explicit statements like "to find a way to reconcile his love of nature with his life as a clock scribe." The bear functions as obvious catalyst for self-reflection rather than earning its symbolic weight through accumulated particulars. The ending tells us Elian has found "deeper sense of purpose" without showing what this means in practice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of uncovering lies/truth emerges but resolves into abstract realization without specificity. Lines like "the lies she had been seeking to uncover were not just those surrounding the sundial, but also those she had told herself" state the theme directly rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete action. The final image lacks resonant particulars that would reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of preserving ancient knowledge emerges through repetition but lacks complexity or earned insight. The fulgurite glass attempts symbolic resonance but feels ornamental. The ending's moralizing paragraph ("The philosophical seed collector had done her part") states theme rather than embodying it through dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of absence, connection, and healing emerges through atmosphere and reflection, with the palace carpet thread symbolizing "fragile connections." However, the thematic work relies on direct statement ("I felt compelled to explain these absences") rather than dramatized discovery, and the final insight about "lonesome splendor" arrives through assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of beauty's restoration in a mechanically flawed world emerges clearly through the egg symbol and the prince's quest, avoiding explicit moralizing. The extinct bird's egg effectively embodies lost beauty, and the "mechanical heartbeat" creates thematic tension between organic and artificial. However, the resolution's sudden shift from "bitterly sweet nostalgia" to "deep, abiding peace" feels unearned—the story doesn't dramatize how beauty actually reawakens or what specific flaw gets addressed.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.4)
    The healing-from-scars theme emerges through Aria's backstory, the damaged tree, and the grafting metaphor, avoiding direct moralizing. The foreign coin and black sand accumulate symbolic weight across beats. However, the theme resolves too neatly—scars simply "sing" without exploring complexity or cost. The ending's "unyielding compassion" feels asserted rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving forgotten history emerges through the concrete quest and fountain imagery. The ending offers resonance when Aria becomes guardian of liberated memories, though this arrives through declaration ("she vowed") rather than dramatized cost. The fountains' revival creates a satisfying symbolic closure but lacks the complexity that would emerge from showing what preservation costs.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of gentle understanding versus destructive passion emerges through repetition but never develops through specific events or earned insights. The metaphor of sharing light without fire remains abstract, never tested through concrete action or choice. The ending simply restates the opening premise without offering a resonant answer or reweighting prior material through dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    The butterfly migration as metaphor for life/death cycles and the ribbon tradition connect to collective grief thematically, emerging through particulars rather than statement. However, the final insight about grief being "both beautiful and terrible" tends toward the generic without the specific cost or complexity that would elevate the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.6)
    The pendulum's pause-motion rhythm and incremental absolution concept create thematic coherence. However, the theme emerges through direct statement ("incremental absolution," "restore shared balance") rather than dramatized particulars, and the final paragraphs explicitly moralize about redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges only through abstract statements about "intentions that lay beyond" and "echoes" without concrete dramatization. The tapestry's "hidden message" and "long-forgotten language" arrive as assertions rather than earned discoveries. The ending's claim that "the world, once mundane, was now alive" lacks specific imagery to make this transformation felt.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of creation-within-constraint emerges through the central metaphor of mapping possibility, though it tends toward abstraction ("weaving together threads of probability and potentiality"). The piece gestures at complexity but doesn't earn its philosophical weight through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of storytelling as magic emerges through the accumulation of dust, music, and narrative imagery. The final image of the waiting radio dial suggests ongoing creative possibility. However, the piece tends toward explicit statement ("narrative possibilities," "keeping the flame of storytelling alive") rather than trusting its imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of impermanence emerges clearly but through explicit philosophical statements rather than dramatized tension. Lines like "The truth is not always what it seems, but in the impermanence of art, we find a reflection of our own mortality" directly state the theme. The final paragraphs contain multiple instances of theme-summary ("the mirage of safety," "fleeting moments of life") that replace earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of competing narratives versus uncomfortable truth emerges through Kael's archaeological metaphor and rejection of "official stories," but resolves into abstract contemplation rather than earned insight. The final smile and acceptance of the "long, hard road" gesture toward thematic resolution without the specific experiential cost that would make it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of preserving vanishing arts through harmony emerges clearly through the zither and choir work. However, it develops through direct statement ("vanishing arts," "unlearn hatred") rather than dramatized complexity. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing about music's power undermines subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    The decay-to-renewal theme emerges clearly through setting and action, with pruning as "gentle rebellion against forces of decay." However, the theme remains surface-level without complexity—everything resolves too neatly into hope. The final image of the sprouting seed feels unearned without showing what was sacrificed for this renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges only through explicit statement: "Sometimes, it's the failures that preserve wonder in routine." The beehive-as-adaptation metaphor remains abstract without concrete dramatization. The piece tells its meaning through dialogue rather than earning resonance through specific events with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden energies and sanctified spaces emerges through Eli's actions and the orris root's properties, avoiding direct statement. The concept of "displaced objects" sanctifying space offers intriguing thematic potential. However, the final revelation that houses are "living, breathing entities" feels unearned without concrete particulars showing what this means or costs—it remains an abstract claim rather than a resonant discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstract statements about "nuance," "understanding," and "transformation" rather than concrete particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "hope and renewal" instead of earning resonance through scene. The concept of "animating the lifeless" gets stated repeatedly without dramatized demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges through heavy abstraction about possibility, uncertainty, and infinite pursuit, but relies on direct philosophical statements ("the universe as a vast, interconnected web") rather than dramatized particulars. The dice metaphor for chance versus determinism is present but not explored through action. Final paragraph philosophizing replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving lost languages and human connection emerges through consistent imagery, though it tends toward abstraction ("beauty and connection were always within reach"). The calligrapher's brush carries symbolic weight across the piece. However, the ending delivers its message through direct statement rather than earned resonance from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of preserving cultural heritage and displaced persons' stories emerges through the bread sculptures and opera glass, but remains surface-level without complexity or cost. Elena's declaration about being the city's "guardian" reads as prompt-fulfillment moralizing rather than earned resonance. The final image doesn't reweight prior material or offer a non-literal answer to any central question.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges primarily through explicit statements about transformation and hidden power rather than through dramatized particulars. The story tells us about "stepping beyond fate's design" but doesn't show what fate's constraints looked like or what specific price the protagonist pays. The ending declares thematic significance ("beacon of hope and transformation") without earning it through concrete scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme attempts to explore fear and allure but relies on telling ("repulsive allure," "trick fear") rather than dramatizing these concepts through specific events. The ending's "haunting refrain" tries to assert resonance without earning it through particulars. The story states its themes explicitly rather than letting them emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of transformation ("turning obstacles into instruments") emerges through action but never encounters actual obstacles to transform, reducing it to assertion rather than earned wisdom. The piece gestures toward harmony between natural and crafted but lacks the complexity or cost that would make this resonant beyond surface metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme emerges through the tension between knowledge-seeking and unknown dangers, but remains underdeveloped. The recurring watchers and patterns suggest larger meaning without delivering resonance. The ending's "haunting, sunwashed dread" attempts mood over meaning, lacking the non-literal answer to the central question that would elevate theme.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.6)
    The noble lies theme emerges through explicit contemplation rather than dramatized discovery. The story tells us about "deliberate distortions of truth" but doesn't show Emilia confronting a specific lie with stakes. The final image of carrying truth "back into the world" remains abstract without showing what specific truth was uncovered or its implications.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of presence in absence—the inkwell holds stories through its emptiness, the surveyor preserves by departing. The final image of darkness swallowing the surveyor while stories remain as "a beacon in the void" offers resonant non-literal answer to questions of legacy and memory. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("interlaced absence") that could be more fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme remains surface-level, revolving around vague notions of "uncovering truth" and "forgotten knowledge" without specific insight. The final assertion that "the forgotten and the obscure held the key to understanding the present" reads as generic wisdom rather than earned revelation from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transforming grief into art emerges clearly through the lantern-making and origami metaphors. However, it's stated too explicitly ("transforming sorrow into something radiant") and the final image doesn't offer a resonant non-literal answer but merely continues the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme emerges mainly through explicit statements about "unused potential" and "unfiltered awakening" rather than through dramatized particulars. The geode crystal's "intangibly tangible essence" and repeated mentions of guidance feel forced rather than organic. Final paragraph moralizing ("she would never be the same again") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of belonging emerges through direct statement rather than dramatized particulars: "frequency of belonging was not just a signal, but a sense of connection." The story tells us Lena finds belonging but never shows what she lacked or sacrificed. The ending's assertion that she "had uncovered a truth that would stay with her forever" substitutes declaration for earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "sieved hush" metaphor and tension between manufactured memories and truth-seeking offer thematic potential, but resolution comes through direct statement: "she was driven by a desire to discover the weight of the withheld truth." The driftwood carvings momentarily suggest physical manifestation of secrets but don't accumulate meaning or constrain the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of transforming "mistakes into wisdom" through patient negotiation emerges from the accumulative structure and recurring imagery. However, it tends toward abstraction ("the world where the past was not forgotten, but learned from") rather than arising from concrete dramatized struggle, weakening its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.6)
    The navigation/direction metaphor coheres but remains surface-level, with the broken compass symbolism overly transparent. Theme emerges through repetitive abstract statements about "aligning heart and actions" and "gravitating towards purpose" rather than through dramatized particulars that would resonate beyond generic recovery narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through heavy-handed metaphors ("labyrinth of choices") and explicit statements about empathy. The final paragraph commits thematic echo with "determination to kindle empathy" restating the prompt language. Subtext is absent—everything is declared directly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of transformation and cosmic connection emerges but relies on direct statement ("cosmic intimacy," "cosmic level") rather than earned resonance. The fortune cookie's message about transformation reads as planted theme rather than organic emergence. Final paragraph explains rather than resonates: "harbinger of change" and "dramatic turn" tell what should be felt.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of time's accumulation in memory emerges through the recurring motifs, particularly the hand-tracings that physicalize temporal passage. However, the piece states its themes too directly ("lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories") rather than letting them emerge from dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of memory preservation and transformation emerges through the concrete action of stitching photographs, avoiding direct moralizing. The concept of shadow work and confronting repressed psyche elements provides thematic depth. However, the resolution's assertion that Aurora "fulfilled her purpose" without showing the specific cost or transformation weakens thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through the recurring "whispering hush" and transformation motif, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the abstract treatment ("complex web of connections and coincidences") lacks the specific particulars that would charge the ending with resonant meaning beyond surface mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of silent revolution versus status quo emerges through the cradle's activation and spreading light metaphor. The bronze quill holder's connection to revolution provides some thematic layering. However, the piece resolves into simple binary (darkness/light, oppression/freedom) without exploring complexity or cost. The final paragraphs drift into abstract moralizing about "courage and determination."

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of sacred patterns governing reality emerges organically through the rock arrangement ritual and vision sequence. The "borrowed dawn" concept effectively suggests temporal liminality, though the ending's assertion that secrets are "now a little more understood" undercuts the mystical resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstract phrases ("cartography of scars," "masks slipping") that never concretize into specific experience. The final "understanding" is declared without showing what particular insight was gained or its implications.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of "turning questions into destinations" and finding truth through conflict remains abstract sermon rather than dramatized discovery. The sewing needle card's metaphorical significance ("threads that connected questions to destinations") feels forced. The ending's claim that "true victory lay not in winning, but in the journey itself" contradicts the story's focus on Aurélien's triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "forging beauty from anarchy" emerges through the library restoration metaphor and connects to broader resistance. However, the resolution slides into explicit moralizing ("The city was not yet saved, but it was on the path to healing") rather than letting the image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of frozen time, hidden worlds, and musical expression, though it tends toward abstract meditation on grief rather than earned insight. The recurring motifs (clock, compasses, film) create coherent symbolism but don't constrain choices or accumulate pressure. The ending's assertion of finding "a new melody" lacks the resonant reconfiguration that would reweight prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of preserving collective memory emerges through Aria's work and the knowledge fruit seed metaphor, but remains at surface level without complexity or counter-pressure. The story tells us memory preservation matters but doesn't dramatize why these specific memories are vital or what their loss would mean. The ending's assertion that memories are "safe, for now" lacks resonant ambiguity or non-literal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "tides of remembrance" metaphor coheres throughout and the cerulean/blue motif provides consistent emotional coloring, earning points for thematic unity. However, the theme arrives pre-packaged through explicit statements about "unspoken apologies" rather than emerging from dramatized particulars, and the ending's teaching frame feels unearned.

    The theme of gradual change emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the butterfly wing, decay, and neutron stars, resisting direct statement.

Some thematic statements ("essence of the human experience") verge on prompt-language but are not egregious.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges masterfully from the core concept—resilience as a strategic, patient act of cultivation, not just destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the core concept—the impact of memories on healing—without direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the thawing heart metaphor and the act of creation, resisting moralizing for a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of embracing vulnerability emerges organically from the character's struggle. However, the final paragraph leans toward explicit thematic statement ("to prove that vulnerability is power") rather than trusting the resonant, non-literal image of walking into a brighter future.

    The theme of mapping the ineffable emerges organically through concrete action and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the integration of the lens, tickets, and setting. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of honesty. A slight tendency toward thematic statement ("freed by honesty") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the central relationship between dresser and garden, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. The final image of the marbles reweights prior material with profound ambiguity.

    Theme (beauty in transience, power of stillness) emerges organically from the chronicle keeper's actions and the decaying setting. The final image of "crumbling peace" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The integration is strong, though the concept of "regenerative silence" edges toward thematic statement at times.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)

== Grader: GPT-5 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme is coherent—gradual change, decay as creative, chaos/order—but often stated outright (“reality preprocesses itself”) rather than earned by scene. Recurring dust imagery provides some subtextual carry. The final peace resonates mildly without sentimentality, but the essayistic assertions dilute depth. A sharper on‑page test would deepen thematic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Themes of legacy, stillness, and pattern recognition are coherent and sustained through recurring images. Yet the piece leans on explicit statements (“she knew that her art was not just about creating beauty…”) that undercut subtext. The ending resonates but edges toward moralizing assurance instead of ambiguity with felt cost. Emotional aftereffect is calm rather than prismatic.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of resilience, collaboration, and art as survival emerge naturally from image chains (heat, frost, vibration, light). Subtext lives in the silent exchange and mutual labor rather than pronouncements. The closing image reweights prior material without sermonizing, though a few lines flirt with familiar phrasing (“symphony of silence,” “unshaken marvels”). The resonance lingers despite a slightly tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Recurring images (signal, stillness, lens) gesture toward a theme of transforming grief into sanctuary. Yet the piece states its thesis repeatedly (“give rest a permanent address”), slipping into overt moralizing near the end. Subtext is light; resonance comes more from assertion than earned scene pressure. The signal’s shift is a promising image that could carry more of the thematic load.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.6)
    Solidarity, anonymity of giving, and intergenerational care form a coherent thematic braid, but much of it is articulated directly. The repeated affirmations (“We will not be broken...”) verge on sermonizing rather than earning resonance through scene friction. The bell motif offers mild resonance at the end. Subtext is thin where statement dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of compassion, self‑held love, and liminality cohere with wisteria/camera obscura motifs. Subtext is often replaced by direct statement—“The love you seek is within” reads as a thesis line and undercuts resonance. The final walk into night with blossoms whispering is evocative but tidy. Complexity and counter‑readings are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of perception, participation in time, and craft-as-cosmos emerge, and the final image—folding the fragment into maze design—offers a resonant alignment of vocation and revelation. However, explicit declarations (“true nature of their quest,” “disintegrate the boundaries”) do some work the images could do. Subtext is present but frequently summarized. The result is thoughtful, if lightly over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of hope, resilience, and collective action are clear but often told outright (“the power of hope and resilience”) rather than earned through contested beats. Recurrences (wall, arrow, seeds) gesture toward resonance but resolve into affirmation without ambiguity. The closing legacy note offers uplift, not a reprice with cost. More subtext and less overt moralizing would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Memory, absence, and repair interweave, and the “trust breaking” motif reweights into a tool for healing. Still, the piece leans on overt moralizing (“even in the darkest moments, there was a way forward”), which flattens ambiguity. The mother’s memory could carry more friction or cost to avoid sentimentality. The final image resonates but tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of destiny, attention, and the porous line between reality and magic are present but often stated (“destiny whispers secrets”). The final image reprises the motif rather than reframing it with price or irony. Subtext is thin because conflict is minimal; wonder remains largely untroubled. The piece avoids sermonizing but leans on platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of thaw, renewal, and creating inquiry sanctuaries resonate through image patterns, especially the orb as hope. Yet the piece leans on explicit articulation (“They would continue to craft safe zones…”) that flattens subtext. The ending offers a gentle answer but edges toward moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is present but not layered with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme is stated rather than discovered (“vulnerability is power,” “truth is in the shadows”). The phrase decoded reweights the protagonist’s self‑image, providing some resonance, but subtext is thin and moralizing creeps in near the end. The seashell and shadow motif could carry more implication if allowed to speak through action. Emotional aftereffect is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of narrative shaping reality and silence as generative force accrue through recurring images (“ambered hush,” dying star, rearranged shadows). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: attention can rewrite the night. However, lack of counterpressure or moral calculus limits depth. Coherence is strong; complexity is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of emergent sentience and second chances cohere with the setting and recur through the violin motif. Subtext is present but frequently overtaken by explicit statements (“Zeta understood…,” “a testament to the power…”), which blunt resonance. The ending offers a conceptual answer, but it edges into summary and moralizing. More dramatized friction would deepen ambiguity and linger.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of honesty, transparency, and clarity are coherent and threaded through recurring objects. Subtext is limited because the story often states its thesis (“freed by honesty”) instead of letting images carry it. The final image offers conceptual repricing but skirts sentimentality via repetition. Complexity and counter‑readings are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around reciprocity, care as dialogue, and the elegy of “withering beauty.” The marbles reprise reweights memory and labor without moralizing, producing a gentle after‑glow. Some lines tilt toward telling (“measurable luck,” “wisely pragmatic”), blunting subtext. Still, the final image credibly reframes earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    Recurring images (icy warmth, beating wings, nexus) aim at themes of suspended life and sideways temporality, culminating in a renewed sense of purpose. However, explicit assertions (“change the course of human understanding forever”) undercut resonance with told significance. The ending answers the thematic question conceptually but with little ambiguity or cost. Subtext is present but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    Ideas of liminality (“in between spaces”), art as conduit, and communion across time recur and cohere. Thematic articulation sometimes leans declarative and repetitive, edging toward sentimentality in the final assurances. The closing image reweights prior motifs but doesn’t complicate them with a countercurrent or cost. Subtext exists, but it’s voiced more than earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Uncertainty vs. human desire for certainty is woven through motifs (margins, aurora, rare bloom) and culminates in a resonant repricing. However, the theme is stated outright (“The truth was not a fixed or determinate thing”), dulling subtext. The final image of vanishing with “auroral sorrow” is evocative and honest. Overall resonance is strong but occasionally over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of industrial ghosts, appraisal of hidden truths, and skepticism meeting ambience accrue coherently. Some lines state thesis‑like ideas (“By interpreting these calls… a method for understanding…”) rather than letting events imply them. The final clarity reweights earlier images modestly but avoids deeper ambiguity or contradiction. Resonance lingers as mood more than as a charged moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silence as balm, beauty in decay, and purpose through stillness emerge organically via recurring images (origami swan, obsidian refuge, seasons). The ending’s stasis answers the thematic question with a quiet acceptance. Some thematic lines are stated outright, dulling subtext. Nonetheless, resonance lingers through image more than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of “ordinary magic” and connection is coherent and carried by recurring images (music as bridge, eclipse, keepsake). However, several lines state the thesis directly (“It was a moment that would nurture lifelong wonder”), dampening subtext. The final image resonates but leans sentimental rather than complex. Ambiguity and countercurrents are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Memory, afterlives of objects, and the blend of past/present accrue through image rather than moralizing. The final dragons’ stir and “bronze quiet” reprise give a subtle conceptual echo. However, subtext stays safe; love/loss is asserted via the diaries without dramatized conflict. The piece invites reflection but not a non‑obvious thematic reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    “Open secrets” and “familiar enigma” recur as stated ideas rather than emerging from charged specifics or subtext. The ending moralizes the change (“life would never be the same”) instead of letting an image reweight prior material. The lighthouse and microdot could have borne thematic load if they altered a choice. The resonance is conceptual but not earned through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of revelation through silence and simplicity recur (blue, silence-as-presence) and culminate in the final hush. However, the piece often states its thesis (“illuminate hidden assumptions,” “underlying truths”) instead of letting subtext carry it. The ending offers a resonant image, but moralizing diction dilutes subtlety. More concrete struggle would deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of reflection vs. reality and creativity born of stillness are coherent and threaded through mirrored imagery. Several lines verge on direct thesising (“a testament to the beauty...”), softening subtext. The final image resonates but relies on assertion rather than a reweighted consequence. The nautilus/mirror patterning supports meaning without overcomplication.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of self‑conquest and integration accumulates via echoes and the tablet’s secrets, with a closing image of “darkening brightness” that reprises early light motifs. Resonance is present but leans on abstract statements (“world was remade,” “she would never be the same”) over concrete costs or ironies. The insight lands, yet feels unchallenged by competing meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silence-as-music and the “hidden language” of reversed songs cohere into a contemplative theme with decent subtext. Still, the piece edges into overt thesis (“a testament to the power of silence”) that blunts resonance. The broken needle’s repricing helps, yet the final paragraphs explain rather than allow the image to do the work. Emotional afterglow is present but not layered with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nature’s calm versus clandestine harm threads through the images and her ethic of “integrity in solitude.” The message tube’s reprise and the night’s “layered tranquility” support a quiet moral stance without overt sermonizing, though one line states theme directly. The final resolve modestly reweights prior material but doesn’t deepen ambiguity or cost. Resonance lingers, if softly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.3)
    Memory, scent, and loss cohere thematically and recur in images (vial, extinct plants, UV patterns). Final insights verge on stated moral (“carry the lessons,” “impact of memories”), dulling subtext. Resonance is earned but somewhat sentimental and over‑explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of time’s texture and choice accumulate through recurring images (rope, stones, dawn) with some resonance. Yet several lines state the thesis outright (“impossible choices...”), tipping toward tell rather than subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs, but ambiguity leans gentle rather than charged. Emotional aftereffect is present but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—beauty in the unfinished, connection softening desolation—emerges through images (bowl, shipwrecks, greenhouse, music) with a resonant reweighting at the end. A few explicit statements (“a beauty that was not polished or perfect”) veer toward telling, trimming subtlety. Still, the final charged quiet and tempered hush carry genuine emotional aftereffect. Subtext in the communal scene largely does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of authenticity versus fabrication and empathy tempered by distance arise organically from the work and setting. The “half truths” motif is integrated and reprises at the end with the petal as emblem. Some lines tip into telling (“not lies, exactly”) rather than letting subtext do the work. The final sanctuary image resonates but doesn’t reprice the premise with new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (“cycles of compassion”) is explicit and sincere, but often told rather than earned through layered subtext. The locket could have carried deeper ambiguity or loss to complicate the ethic. The ending affirms goodness without a counter‑pressure, skirting sentimentality. Resonance is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of belonging through art is coherent but over‑stated; several lines paraphrase the thesis rather than let images carry it. Subtext is limited; symbolism is direct and repeated without fresh inflection. The arbor/tag reprise provides some resonance, but the piece edges toward moralizing summary in the final stretch. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Time, echoes, art, and infinity interweave into a cohesive meditation on perception and hidden cadences. The final image reweights the city and her art without moralizing. Some lines verge on statement-of-theme (“key to unlocking the hidden cadence”), blunting subtext. Nonetheless, resonance remains and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of grief/ambiguous loss, secrecy, and the limits of quantification emerge, and the glass eyes reprise charges the ending. Yet the text often states its theses (“mathematics of emotion,” “realm of possibility”) instead of letting scene pressure imply them. The resonance is pleasant but somewhat pre‑digested. The last image lingers more for atmosphere than for an earned moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of visibility/care, memory as compass, and quiet guardianship emerge from images and actions (scent-triggered history → renewed purpose → caches). Subtext generally carries the load, though the ending edges toward assertion (“there was always hope”). The final “sapphire hush” reframes prior texture with modest resonance. Complexity is present but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of renewal through surrender is coherent but over‑told; the text declares its thesis repeatedly (“transformation was a journey worth undertaking”). Symbolic echoes (trellis/leaf/storm) work, yet subtext is sparse beneath the explicit moral. The ending moralizes instead of letting image alone carry repricing, dulling resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (seeking balance/meaning from ruin) is coherent and returns via the brooch-as-symbol and the titled artwork. Yet it’s over‑articulated (“The finished piece was a reflection... a testament...”), reducing subtext. The ending reweights prior material but leans on statement rather than image‑driven resonance. Complexity is present but not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme—magic in the ordinary—is clear but over‑articulated, culminating in direct statements (“the most profound magic lies…”). Imagery repeats rather than evolves subtext. Moments of humility (“she had not foreseen”) hint at richer complexity but aren’t tested in scene. Resonance is present but edges toward moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of remembrance, resilience, and communal narrative coalescence are clear and coherent. Yet the piece leans on explicit moralizing (“beacon of hope,” “power of remembrance”) rather than subtextual turns. The valve’s reprise provides resonance, but complexity and counterpressure are limited. The ending’s insights feel stated more than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of initiation, patterns, and truth‑seeking surface, but are conveyed through declarations (“never see the world the same”) rather than subtextual turns. The recurring punch and arrows hint at meaning, yet the final insight feels generic. Ambiguity is safe rather than charged. Little moral or conceptual cost complicates the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Patterns, memory, and song cohere into a clear theme of connection and reconfiguration. Resonance arises in the final melding of whales’ song and symbols. However, several lines tip into thesis‑like abstraction (“the very fabric of reality”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The insight feels earned but cushioned by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece circles a tight thematic question—what remains after goodbye—and answers through a reconfiguration: goodbye as transformation, embodied by the echo. However, the duplicate’s “I am what remains after goodbye” is an on‑the‑nose thesis line that diminishes subtext. The closing image (colors, gateway, echo lingering) carries resonance. Insight feels earned by patterning, if somewhat stated rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Fair trade vs grift, and “waiting actively” as a moral calculus, recur through images (ink pot) and stance. Some thematic statements are declared rather than earned (“mathematics of a fair trade”), softening subtext. The final charged poise reprises the motif effectively but doesn’t reprice the premise with fresh cost. Resonant, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of invented histories and attention as an ethical act emerge through recurring objects and ritualized practice. The final image (“notepad held the promise of new stories”) resonates modestly but edges toward summary. Subtext stays thin because no competing values or losses complicate the practice. The result is sincere but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.6)
    Memory, erasure, and recovery are coherent, with the poison label as emblem. Much of the thematic work is told in abstract terms (“texture of memories”) rather than earned through event. The ending’s resonance is gentle but not reweighting. Little subtext arises beyond the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of memory as instrument, science braided with myth, and listening to ancestry accrue through images. The final reweighting—observatory no longer forsaken—lands, but “unlocked the secrets of the universe” edges toward platitude. Subtext exists in the cello/shell alchemy yet avoids confronting a cost or counter‑pressure. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of communal resilience and anti-privatization are coherent but overexplained (“spirit that could not be bought or sold”). Subtext is light; symbolism around the foundation chip works yet remains declared rather than earned through scene. The ending’s hopefulness resonates, but sentiment skirts didacticism. Complexity and counter-pressure are underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Time and transience cohere through the flora, dawn, and hourglass grain, and the final return of the grain reweights the imagery. Some lines veer toward sentimentality and explicit statement, but the motif‑driven resonance mostly carries. The melancholy afterimage is earned by particulars rather than a stated moral. Depth is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Harmony between craft and environment is threaded through mist, water, and vibration motifs, re-weighted in the final hover. The piece resists overt moralizing and lets the images carry meaning. However, the resonance leans tidy, with little counter-pressure or complexity to trouble the calm. The auspicious ship moment reads symbolic more than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of pursuit, mapping, and kinship across time (the phrasebook) accumulate toward a quiet awe. The “worrying tranquility” and falcon lore suggest change without tipping into moralizing, but the resonance is familiar rather than reweighted in a surprising way. The final image offers promise more than repricing. Subtext remains mostly at mood level.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Harmony/balance and the power of sound arise organically from the ritual, with a credible final reweighting at dawn. However, thematic statements (“The tuner’s motivation… to restore a shared balance”) tilt toward telling. The resonance is gentle and coherent but avoids friction or counter‑pressure that could complicate meaning. The ending answers quietly without a sharp reframe.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Memory versus preservation’s cost resonates through the scent motif and the temple’s hush, culminating in a bittersweet repricing of success. Thematic statements stay mostly in image rather than moralizing. The reprise of the vial’s scent at the end delivers a durable emotional aftereffect. Some phrasing veers toward abstraction, softening the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of legacy, truth, lies, and authorship thread coherently through recurring images (scuffs, lattice, hush). The ending’s resolve to “follow the threads” offers resonance but little reweighting; the moral calculus never sharpens. Some lines state theme rather than let it emerge from conflict. The “bodies” hint could have deepened repricing but remains unused.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of indebtedness across lifetimes and guidance with a bittersweet cost emerge organically from the images and final cadence. “Lovingly venomous” intent is more labeled than dramatized, but the closing realization reweights prior material. The ending’s mournful elation offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Depth is felt, if not deeply contended.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—art as redemptive transformation—is coherent but over‑articulated via repeated thesis lines (“carve a path from ruin to reverence,” “power of art to transform”) rather than emerging from conflict. Subtext mostly converts to statement in the final paragraphs. The plate/tapestry/dawn images carry some resonance, but sentiment skirts platitude. Ambiguity and counterpressure are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.5)
    Heritage and restoration resonate through concrete images (bones, roots, sundial), producing a gentle afterglow. Some thematic assertions are told outright (“not just about uncovering the past… restoring a lost faith”), blunting subtext. The ending reweights prior images but skirts sentimentality via neat fulfillment. Ambiguity remains mild rather than prismatic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of “beauty in slowness” vs. instant communication is clear but often stated outright (“anachronism,” “beauty in its slowness”). Subtext flickers in the chalk‑code conceit and the charged final image but is undercut by explicit moralizing. The finale reweights nostalgia, yet without a sharp, specific cost. Resonance is present but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of pattern‑listening, concealed wisdom, and art as epistemology recur with a resonant final image. However, lines like “would change the course of history” flatten subtext into assertion. The piece invites reflection without moralizing, but its insight is told more than earned through conflict. The candle and chart motifs do carry quiet after‑echo.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of unspoken apology, regret, and the ethics of evocation develop organically through letters → messages → apparition → reflection. The final charged poise (“a reflection that was both Aria’s and not her own”) reweights prior images without moralizing. “Fierce tenderness” is enacted rather than declared, though some lines verge on stating stakes. The resonance is real but not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Resilience and shared pain reframed into meaning emerge organically from the coral/cast motifs, and the final image resonates quietly. Yet several lines edge toward platitude (“power of hope and resilience”), weakening subtext. The insight is earned but safe, with limited counter-pressure or ambiguity. The symbolism is clear, sometimes overt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of reclamation, art as resurrection, and permeability of reality/dream accrue through image patterns. Occasional telling (“She had been feeling lost…”) blunts subtext. The final image reweights the orchard with quiet resonance, if not surprise. Complexity is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of curiosity vs. certainty and art’s permeability emerge from action and recurring objects (hobo nickel as inquiry talisman, mirrors). The final image reweights her premise credibly. Some moralizing intrudes (“she had exchanged certainty for curiosity”), muting subtext. A more oblique close would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of resistance, covert language, and communal subversion are coherent and on brand with the images. Yet they’re asserted repeatedly (“beacon of resistance,” “unbreakable spirit”) rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and the final paragraphs verge on sermonizing. The gourd’s reprise gestures toward resonance but lacks a reweighting moment with cost. Subtext is thin because conflicts are not staged.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—art as alchemy of suffering into beauty—emerges via the postcard/armistice echo and the lullaby’s calming effect. Some phrasing leans declarative (“photosynthesize it into beauty”), but the final pulsing fungi image provides resonance without a stated moral. The blossom armistice functions more as emblem than operational theme.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory, loss, and custodianship cohere through recurring images (orchids, chime, song). The ending’s quiet endurance offers resonance without moralizing. Some thematic statements verge on telling rather than arising entirely from action. Nevertheless, the final illumination reweights the premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of trust, listening, and restitution emerge through the work of translation and the ink well’s reprise. “Symphonies of truth” is evocative but over‑asserted, edging toward slogan. The ending’s image reweights her isolation into readiness, but the moral calculus is tidy and low‑friction. Subtext exists in the sanctuary/penance dynamic, if lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme (compassion, unity, community) is consistent but over‑told, especially in the final third, edging toward sermonizing. Subtext is minimal; symbols (chain, breathing stones) are presented rather than allowed to complicate meaning. The final image restates a moral instead of reweighting it through specific consequence. Resonance is gentle but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motifs (paper trails, lost songs, dust motes) align to a theme of curated memory versus honest inhabiting of the past. Resonance appears in the last look through the skylight, but a direct thematic statement (“In the end, it was not just about…”) edges toward moralizing. Subtext mostly rides image rather than conflict. The piece invites reflection without offering a fresh, earned complication at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme coheres around thresholds and “necessary distances,” with a late reframing toward the spiritual. However, it’s often stated rather than dramatized (“The necessary distances are not just physical, but also spiritual”), edging into moralizing. Subtext exists in wood‑grain reading and maze lineage but is not pushed into ambiguity or cost. Resonance lingers mildly, not deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of belonging and attunement are clear but over‑asserted, with repeated abstractions (“luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder”) substituting for subtext. Resonance is limited by summative final paragraphs that tell the lesson. The feather’s reprise offers a faint thematic turn, but it lacks a charged reweighting. Little ambiguity or friction invites deeper reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of flux/transformation coheres with vanishing paths and memory. Yet it’s stated outright (“The story was one of flux and transformation”), reducing subtext and discovery. The final image reweights prior motifs but avoids a thornier ambiguity or price. Resonance is pleasant rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.1)
    Art/science and chance/design are coherent, but theme often arrives as statement rather than arising from conflict. The bishop’s heavier return edges toward a conceptual repricing, yet lacks a cost or reframed choice to resonate. Final lines restate possibility rather than deepen it. Subtext is thin because nothing is risked.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of exile, anti‑nostalgia, and art as a cosmological bridge emerge, but several sentences state them outright (“a celebration of the interconnectedness of all things”). The strongest thematic work is image‑driven (gaps between waves/stars → unity → inscription). The “nostalgia ban” is intriguing but under‑dramatized, limiting subtextual complexity. The ending offers a resonant, if gentle, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme is declared rather than earned: “illuminate value in the mundane,” “noctilucent reckonings,” and similar phrases do the work that subtext might. The ripple pattern gestures toward emergent order, but the piece explains its meaning instead of letting images carry it. The ending’s gratitude lands, yet veers toward platitude without counter‑pressure. Minimal ambivalence or cost blunts resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of wounded stewardship, reframed pain, and fragile beauty recur, with the cracked box as a workable emblem. However, overt statements (“translate his pain into a universal language,” “a messenger”) reduce subtext and edge toward sermonizing. Resonance exists but is asserted as much as earned. The final image supports the theme but without fresh complication.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of imagination as praxis and hope’s “equations” are coherent but often stated directly rather than emerging from conflict. The trial‑balloon motif offers a graceful metaphor, especially in the precipice launch image. However, lines like “knew that she was on the right path” tilt toward moralizing summary. Subtext is outshouted by explicit intent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of legacy, memory, and stewardship are coherent but over-articulated (“The legacy’s burden… was not just a weight to be carried, but a story to be told”). The resonance is asserted rather than earned through concrete conflict. Some lyrical images carry feeling, but final-paragraph moralizing blunts subtext. The walls’ “dreams” remain conceptual more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of art as invocation and possibility beyond reality emerge organically through image (prism, mirrors, lullaby). The final image reprises those motifs but leans on assertions of success (“she knew she had succeeded”) rather than earned repricing. Subtext is gentle and consistent, if unsurprising. No late moralizing, but the resonance remains safe.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of redemption, ritual, and flawed beauty recur coherently, with the clipboard reappearing in the last image. Subtext is thin because the piece states significance (“through ritual significance”) rather than letting action imply it. The final calm carries resonance, but moralizing diction and repetition blunt nuance. The insight feels familiar rather than earned through specific conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Resonance emerges through the egg and the “echo of extinct birds,” but thematic statements like “testament to the destructive power of greed” tilt toward telling. The final image reweights earlier motifs (egg, water, birds) into a gentle repricing of loss and renewal. Moral complexity is hinted by “amoral philanthropist,” yet not substantively tested. The piece invites reflection but avoids real ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of defiance and self-authorship emerge, and the prism’s alarming serenity offers a workable final answer-image. However, several lines state the moral (“beauty of being true to oneself,” “new sense of purpose”), weakening subtext. Symbolism is effective but occasionally on-the-nose. Resonance lingers more through image than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of truth/deception and ethics of storytelling align with the dome-as-surveillance-turned-sanctuary image. However, several thesis-like declarations (“mission to explore the ethics of storytelling”) replace subtext with exposition. Resonance exists but is not earned through conflict or a charged choice in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of transience, memory, and reverence are coherent, supported by recurring images (moth wing, ephemeral structures). However, they’re often asserted (“a testament to the power of memory,” “poignant reminder”) rather than earned through conflict. Subtext remains thin because no counter-pressure complicates the ethic of honoring the overlooked. The ending’s resonance is gentle but predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    Memory, preservation, and forgiveness converge in the final hum; the aurora motif supports a gentle, elegiac theme. However, the last paragraphs lean into explicit moralizing (“a testament to the power of memory and the human spirit”), softening subtext. The insight feels true but tidy. More implication, less telling, would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Ideas about agency versus paths “choosing” walkers recur and culminate in a gentle reweighting. However, several lines state theme outright (“To transcend was not just to overcome...”), blunting subtext. The wafer seal’s reprise suggests authentication as fate, but the resonance is more told than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of devotion, pattern, and unity are coherent and recur via the tile and sky. Yet the ending over‑asserts (“life’s work was complete,” “universe would forever be changed”), tipping into told significance rather than earned resonance. Subtext is thin where declaration dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    The thematic argument—shifting grace, release over resentment—is coherent but mostly told, not dramatized. Repeated abstractions and final-paragraph moralizing dampen subtext. The music box/brokenness motif offers a promising image, though it’s leaned on as a sermon rather than earned revelation. Emotional aftereffect is gentle but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of boundary erasure, rebirth from fragments, and art as portal cohere through sextant/mirror motifs. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer (art creates a doorway, but you may lose yourself). Some phrasing leans toward statement (“erasing the boundaries…”) rather than pure emergence, slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the motifs reweight cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “deciduous vows” motif threads theme with some grace, and the ribbon/seeds reprise offers resonance. However, the piece leans on direct thematic assertion (“deciduous in nature”) rather than subtext at crucial beats. The ending’s warmth borders on tidy sentiment rather than earned ambiguity. Still, the thematic throughline feels coherent and organic to the images.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—knowledge as nonlinear inheritance—aligns with the Order, the stone, and the final “brightened disquiet.” However, the piece states its thesis (“knowledge was not a linear progression”) rather than earning it fully through action and image. Subtext exists in the odd, sacred mundanity of a bathroom epiphany, but complexity and counter‑pressure are limited. The closing resonance is gentle, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of knowledge vs. application and “unlearned lessons” are coherent and supported by recurring images (hidden door, unheard symphony). However, the final paragraphs articulate the takeaway overtly (“no longer content to simply uncover knowledge”), veering into moralizing. Subtext is reduced by summary; resonance comes more from assertion than scene-earned implication. The symphony motif helps, but the insight feels pre-declared.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    Memory, loss, and preservation resonate, and the Garden-as-mind reframes the quest. Yet explicit statements (“seemed to be a metaphor for the fragility of human memory”) undercut subtext. The final peace lacks the sting of cost, limiting afterglow. Imagery wants to do the thematic lifting but is often told rather than discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme coheres around pattern, absence, and clarity, with the rope/wax seal reweighted at the end. Several lines verge on thesis statements (“the power of clear complexity”), dulling subtext. Still, the final image of charged objects and altered perception offers some resonant repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of balance, attentiveness, and restorative quiet coheres through recurring images (cracks, resonance, bloom of hush). Some lines verge on declarative moral (“sanctuary of peace”), trimming ambiguity. Resonance is earned texturally more than by ethical calculus or subtextual reversal. The final image offers serenity but little reframing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of pattern, meaning in coincidence, and hope after ruin emerge through recurring images (stars, shard, orrery). However, the piece occasionally declares its thesis (“they had succeeded… the secrets… about to be revealed”) instead of letting image do the work. The final light image resonates but steers toward sentimentality without counterpressure. Subtext exists but remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of memory, inheritance, and self‑making emerge organically from image patterns (storm → hush → moon → crystal). Some lines overstate thesis (“not just preserving the past, but also shaping the future”), trimming subtext. The final acceptance resonates, if quietly, with a conceptual repricing of her role. Ambiguity remains thoughtful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme—finding a spark in stillness—emerges but leans on explicit statement via the note, flirting with platitude. Recurring images (flame, knot, lanterns) support resonance, yet little subtext accrues from tension or omission. The ending answers the question openly rather than through reweighted particulars. Emotional truth is present but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of transformation and transitional pauses is coherent via cicada/starlight motifs, but it’s often stated rather than earned through action. Subtext is limited because insights are told (“The cicada was a symbol of transformation”) instead of discovered. The ending offers gentle resonance, not a reweighting with consequence. Complexity yields to platitude at times.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silence as nourishment and healing integrates well with the gilded hush and the father’s design; the final image reweights the premise without a moral. A few lines drift toward summary (“worked its subtle magic”), diluting subtext. Still, the lingering “stretching” resonates and invites reflection. Thematic integrity grows from particulars rather than argument.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (silence as comfort) is coherent and echoed via the storm glass and the terrace, yielding a gentle afterglow. Yet it’s often told outright (“to catalyze a deeper understanding”) rather than earned through scene pressure. The ending image reprises motifs but stops short of a conceptual repricing with bite. Subtext in listening is present but not sharpened by opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of hubris, inheritance, and restoration are present and coherently threaded through murals and the “futuristic nostalgia” tone. The maxim “Where shadows fall, light rises” risks platitude, and the ending leans toward declarative uplift (“a new era was about to begin”). Subtext rarely complicates the surface narrative with ambiguity or cost. Resonance emerges, but without a countercurrent it skews tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of isolation, stewardship, and renewal recur, with a final repricing toward connection. However, phrases like “to teach suffocating to breathe” are asserted multiple times instead of being dramatized, dulling subtext. The doorknocker’s reweighting helps, but the resolution feels tidy. Ambiguity exists, yet complexity is undercut by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    Resilience after financial harm and the wonder of possibility emerge, but they’re stated more than earned via conflicted action. The final moral tint (“magic was waiting to be found”) reads tidy and didactic. The submarine bolt and “quantum promise” hint at richer subtext but remain ornamental. Emotional aftereffect is mild rather than reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (intuition bridging knowledge and understanding) is coherent but over‑declared; lines like “a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe” and “would change the course of history” flatten subtext. The recurrence of shadows and waves could have carried resonance, but the piece leans on summary insights instead of earned image‑driven repricing. Final paragraphs slip into sermonizing, dulling ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of surrendering agency to a larger, generative force emerges, with creation/puppetry mirrored in environment and action. Recurring images (program, snap, rippling glass) echo at the end, but subtext is minimal—statements repeat rather than deepen. The final merger image offers resonance but little ambivalence or ethical texture. Avoids moralizing, yet the insight feels prepackaged.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.3)
    Themes of remembrance, dignity, and the salvaging of small kindnesses are coherent but frequently told rather than earned. Final-paragraph moralizing (“testament to the resilience of the human spirit,” “power of unknown histories to transform and redeem”) blunts subtext. The button motif supports resonance, yet the insight feels familiar. Ambiguity is safe, not prismatic.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of preserving history vs. apathy recur through images and the phone booth key, with a decent final resonance at dawn. However, explicit thesis-like phrasing (“tyranny of indifference,” “revised histories”) often states rather than lets scene and subtext carry meaning. The speech at the gathering leans toward sermonizing over dramatization. The ending offers a gentle reprise rather than a deep reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—art as counterspell to communal fear—emerges, but is also stated directly (“a reminder of the power of music to shape the world”), dulling subtext. The final image reaffirms calm and continuity, offering resonance without complication. Complexity is limited by lack of friction with that “coded prophecy.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of honoring the past, listening rightly, and transformation emerge coherently through images and ritual action. However, several lines state theme outright (“one emerges transformed always”), muting subtext and complexity. The ending offers a resonant image but leans into affirmation over complication or counter‑pressure. Reflection is more declarative than discovery‑led.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme coheres around uncertainty, time, and navigation, but it is stated outright (“coincidence becomes pattern,” “befriend uncertainty”) rather than earned through subtext. The compass and greenhouse images carry some resonance in the final image. Lack of friction or counter‑pressure limits complexity. The insight feels tidy rather than wrestled‑for.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes (beauty in brokenness, redemption via acceptance) are overtly stated and reiterated, with limited subtext. The final paragraph moralizes (“weight of names... guiding force”), reducing lingering ambiguity. The kintsugi motif is apt but functions largely as explained metaphor rather than enacted meaning. Emotional aftereffect is gentle but not earned through concrete reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    Healing, listening, and the “luminous ache” cohere, and the release scene embodies them modestly. However, thematic claims (“integrate laughter into healing”) are told outright and arrive late, reducing subtext. The crocodile tooth hints at a richer repricing but remains underexploited. Resonance lingers but edges toward sentimentality by explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme is explicit and repeated; the piece names its thesis (“mathematics of mercy”) rather than letting subtext carry it. There is some resonance between trauma, penance, and the forest’s light, but the epiphany is asserted instead of discovered via concrete particulars. The closing hope lands, albeit tidily. Complexity and counter‑pressure are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motifs (lens, anchors, market) braid toward a theme about witnessing and giving voice, but the piece states its thesis explicitly (“Lena’s motivation… to honor these forgotten tales”), dulling subtext. The final image reweights earlier details, yet moralizing language intrudes. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing. Complexity is gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, decay, and carrying the forgotten emerge coherently through objects (barrel, logbook) and images (dust, fading light). The “cracks in the façade” idea repeats effectively but edges toward on‑the‑nose articulation and mild moralizing. The ending offers a resonant image (humming barrel, weightless burden) that reweights the scene without stating a moral outright. Subtext exists but remains gentle rather than layered with counter‑currents.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres around eternity-as-depth and art’s capacity to reweight reality; recurring images accumulate meaning. The line “Eternity is a moment’s depth” risks on-the-nose statement but gains some charge through enactment. Ambiguity lingers productively in the ripple effect. Thematic complexity is present but safely handled.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of ritual in uncertainty, identity remade through attention, and history’s partial recoverability emerge via recurring images. However, the ending leans on explicit thesis statements (“in the end… not just the civilization… but herself”), sliding toward moralizing and reducing resonance. Subtext exists (mirrors, shard, storm), but overt summarizing blunts it. The final image is evocative, if somewhat told.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Light vs. midnight, truth vs. deceit, and “mending what isn’t torn” braid into a coherent thematic current. The final image reaffirms the ethos without sermonizing, though some lines tread close to overt statement (“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”). Subtext is present in the chip’s dimming and the chamber’s “approval,” which suggests price and covenant. Complexity is limited by the frictionless success.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (seeking the place “where explanations fail”) is stated rather than fully earned through contradiction and choice. Recurring images (hush, compass, lagoon) align with inquiry vs. reason but avoid subtextual friction. The ending’s conceptual repricing is graceful yet platitudinal. The piece gestures toward mystery without forcing a reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—interconnection across time and matter—emerges clearly through the slide, driftwood, and archway. However, it’s stated outright (“timewoven alliances,” “scaffold complexity with simplicity”) instead of developing primarily through subtext and image, edging toward thesis. The final tableau (sculpture as embodiment of the slide’s mystique) resonates, but the piece leans on abstract commentary rather than earned ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of darkness/understanding and interconnection culminate in the final acceptance of night’s logic and tenderness. Recurring images support the idea without overt sermonizing, though the language courts abstraction and repetition (“umbral tenderness,” “dawning hush”). The insight is earned within the lyric mode but remains comfortable rather than complex. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Memory, history, and secrecy cohere via the lagoon and Ada’s retrocognitive state, with some gentle subtext in the debris‑language. Thematic statements (“search for truth,” “secrets waiting to be unlocked”) are repeated and veer toward summary. The ending offers a mood of charged curiosity rather than a reweighted answer. Resonance lingers, but without a sharpened moral calculus or surprising repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of rejecting nostalgia and creation after wishes are present but often stated (“rejects false comfort,” “true creation begins”) rather than earned through scene pressure. Subtext is light; imagery suggests rebirth, yet the text leans on overt declarations. The final vision reassures rather than reweights with cost. Resonance is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Memory, language of the dead, and archival work triangulate themes of how the past recodes the present. The “velvet disquiet” motif and the wax cylinder reprise offer resonance, but the piece edges into telling its thesis (“prophecy had taken on a life of its own”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The ending invites reflection but shies from a non‑literal answer with evident cost. Earned ambiguity is present, moralizing is avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece circles legacy, stewardship, and cyclical time, with the cap/egg motifs. However, explicit thesis lines (“not the destination that mattered,” “By decreasing entropy...”) undercut subtext and drift into moralizing. The final image has some resonance but leans on stated wisdom rather than earned implication. Thematic unity is clear but lacks complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of listening over alarm and attunement to subtlety arise organically through image and action, especially the rope hesitation and the solstice hush. However, the final paragraph edges into declarative moralizing (“a reminder that… listening is a powerful way”), dulling subtext. The bell’s reprise does produce resonance, just without a sharp reweighting. The result is honest but slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme is coherent (strength through vulnerability; stillness as flourishing) but over‑stated, with explicit moralizing lines late. Subtext is thin; symbolism (lantern glass) is direct and undemanding. The ending offers resonance but little reweighting beyond assertion. Ambiguity is safe rather than productive.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    Remembrance versus desolation coheres through bees/letters/ghosts, culminating in a quiet guardianship. The stained glass box functions as a returning image whose glow reweights the premise. Some lines nudge toward abstraction (“tangled covenant,” “power of remembrance”) without on‑page complication, tempering depth. The ending’s resonance is earned if subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme (curiosity amid a timeless world; memory as conduit) is coherent but often stated rather than earned through scene. Recurring images (clock, urn, capsule) carry some resonance but are leaned on as symbols without deep subtextual turns. The final moral energy (“beacon of hope,” “power of human curiosity”) reads platitudinal. Ambiguity is gentle but not especially layered.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Transience and imperfect beauty recur via feather and lost kite, culminating in a peaceful acceptance. Some thematic lines skate close to telling (“to discover beauty in the incomplete”), diluting subtext. Still, the final carry‑forward of the moment provides genuine resonance. The piece avoids sermonizing but offers a relatively familiar insight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    Harmony between human craft and nature, legacy, and reciprocity emerge coherently via recurring images (wire, pillars, diary). The final copper-wire “song” provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the piece leans on explicit thematic statements (“promote interspecies respect”) which dull subtext. More scene-based implication would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of homecoming, skepticism, and pilgrimage surface through recurring images (threshold, footprints, pendant) but are undercut by direct statement (“the skeptic realized…”). Subtext exists in the charged stillness and the pendant’s pulsing, yet the piece leans on thesis‑like lines instead of letting events fully speak. The ending offers resonance, not profundity earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of reclamation, harmony beneath damage, and patient stewardship emerge coherently through image. “Submerged concord” is named rather than dramatized, tilting toward abstraction. The final image of a slumbering, reborn land resonates but edges into sentimentality. Complexity (cost, ambiguity) is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.6)
    Hope, connection, and repair in a ruined world emerge coherently, with the spring and leaf echoing renewal. Subtext is modest; several lines tilt toward statement (“translate distance into closeness”) rather than arising purely from scene. The final quiet image resonates but steers close to sentimentality. The piece invites reflection, yet complexity remains limited.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of orientation, inheritance, and turning stillness into movement emerge through the sketching ritual and the “true north” motif. Some lines slip into thesis-like telling (“a reminder that even in stillness, there was always the potential for movement”). The final image resonates, but ambiguity is safe rather than haunting. Subtext operates, if lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of wonder, balance, and playful reverence emerge, with the sundial lid and chess mechanics echoing cosmic order. However, resonance leans on assertion and serenity rather than layered implication or counterpressure. The final image is pretty but low on reweighting or moral complexity. Minimal subtext—the piece tells us “apprentice of wonder” more than it dramatizes its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    Coherent themes of absence, agency, and reframing history accrue through recurring images (missing pawns, interregnum, luminous absence). Subtext exists but is frequently overtaken by declarative mission statements (“I have come to unbind the past”). The final repricing—seeing pawns as opportunities—lands, though it leans symbolic over felt consequence. Little moral calculus or ambiguity is tested in action.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Transformation, memory’s pain, and “home” cohere thematically, culminating in the bookstore-as-threshold image. The “buried talents” idea motivates but doesn’t complexly refract through conflict. Occasional telling (“For her, home was…”) blunts subtext. The final “hidden thunder” resonates, though the moral calculus remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of guilt, redemption, and the reweaving of time are coherent and supported by recurring images. However, lines like “forgiveness is a journey, not a destination” tip into platitude, reducing subtext. The tapestry/labyrinth motif does some thematic lifting, but insight resolves cleanly. Ambiguity is modest and emotional complexity is streamlined.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Recurring refraction/echo motifs meaningfully align with forgiveness and truth, but the piece articulates its thesis outright (“not something to be paid, but…understood”), reducing subtext. The final image reweights earlier images effectively, yet edges toward sermonizing. Ambiguity remains about forgiveness’s cost, but it’s intellectually framed rather than dramatically earned. Resonance is present; subtlety is not consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of repair-through-flaw (kintsugi) and wresting meaning from oblivion recur and reweight the ending image. Subtext lives in the charm’s pulse and the battered statue as “map,” though these are voiced rather than discovered. Final paragraphs edge toward moralizing (“a gift worth more than any amount of gold”). Resonance remains, but subtlety wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    “Temporary eternity” and the shell motif gesture toward art’s endurance versus time, cohering thematically. However, the theme is asserted repeatedly and edges into summary in the final paragraphs. Subtext is present but safe; little counter‑pressure complicates the insight. The closing legacy note resonates yet feels familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of quiet efficacy and purification recur, with the lighthouse and garden scent doing atmospheric work. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright (“prove that whispers travel farther than shouts”), flattening subtext. The vial-cork-as-purifier suggests a richer moral calculus but isn’t pressed against a counterforce. The ending offers serenity rather than a reweighted answer with sting.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of loss, resilience, and mapping memory cohere through recurring images; the final horizon image reweights prior material without a stated moral. Some lines edge into declarative moralizing (“brighter future”) and reduce subtext. Still, the censer and reverse migration link personal grief to ritual/return in a satisfying way. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of empathy overreach vs. individuality and self‑protection vs. honesty are clear, with the glass eye offering a resonant emblem. Some moments drift into direct statement (“painted a picture… catastrophic loss of individuality”), reducing subtext. The final image reweights prior material but avoids a hard moral. Resonance is present, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of memory custody, witnessed isolation, and objects as mnemonic keys resonate, especially in the last image. However, the legend of the lighthouse “absorbing memories” is told rather than earned through action, softening subtext. The ending gestures toward a repricing of Kael’s role, but the insight is familiar. Still, the Edelweiss motif threads meaning without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    Legacy, guidance, and agency (the “doorway of decisions”) form a coherent thematic braid, and the final return reweights the shop and maps. Recurring motifs (chip, ants, creek) accrue resonance, if somewhat on‑the‑nose. The note from her father risks sentimentality by stating the theme rather than letting it emerge from conflict. The piece invites reflection but avoids deeper ambiguity or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Recurring images (bleeding starlight, fire, clouds) suggest themes of fate and porous reality, but the piece asserts them rather than letting them emerge from dramatized consequence. The climactic “truth” is withheld, so any thematic reweighting is abstract. Final lines promise transformation without a resonant image to embody it. The result feels like premise scaffolding rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of presence, revaluation, and wonder cohere through the shell and light motifs. However, lines like “the truth lies in the density of presence” verge on thesis, reducing subtext. The ending offers resonance but little ambiguity or moral pressure. Insight feels earned in tone, not in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of memory, creativity, and “feral nostalgia” are coherent, but heavily stated; the final paragraphs tip into overt moralizing (“power of creativity,” “found a sense of peace”), muting subtext. Resonance is present yet conventional, with minimal complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme is coherent—finding sacredness in the mundane through occlusion—but delivered via explicit statements (“read between the lines,” “ordinary miracles,” “humanize”) instead of subtext. The screw and water clocks begin to carry symbolic weight, yet the piece often tells its thesis. The ending resonates mildly but edges toward sermonizing. More implication through image would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of stillness-between-storms and stress crystallizing meaning recur through objects and weather and reweight the final image. Some statements verge on the declarative (“true power of the runes crystallizes when stressed,” “transform the scars into stories”), softening subtext. The ending resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Redemption via “imperfect miracles” coheres with her method and the chosen objects, and the orchard motif counterpoints loss/repair. Several theme statements are overt (“true power lay not in grand gestures”), edging toward telling over implication. The ending provides a quiet, resonant answer—hope earned through a humble act—without a neat moral. Subtext exists but is not deeply layered.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of unity, balance, and illusion are present but largely declared; subtext is thin because beats don’t complicate the thesis. The closing paragraphs moralize (“cosmos sang a new song”) rather than earn repricing through event. Resonance is gentle but generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of time’s nature, measuring versus understanding, and vigilance accumulate through recurring images. The “razor edges of time” remains an abstract banner rather than a dramatized dilemma, so the insight feels earned only in mood, not conflict. The final dawn image reweights the quiet more than it answers the central question. Resonance is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    A coherent theme of permeability and connection emerges, but it is often told outright (“revolutionize the way people interacted”) rather than earned through events. Recurring images (mushrooms, strangers, button) support resonance. The final reframing is gentle and pleasing but edges toward platitude. Subtext is present yet thin because antagonistic pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of certainty versus chance and “lucid contradictions” are articulated directly rather than earned through dramatized frictions. The lantern and graffiti offer potential subtext, but the piece often states its thesis (“true understanding lay in embracing these paradoxes”). The ending’s hope softens complexity into a near-moral. More implication and image-led resonance would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Coherent themes of anonymity, ritual, and “teaching endings how to begin” emerge through motif and image. Resonance is achieved by the final charged image, but several lines tilt toward direct thesis‑statement rather than experiential earning. Subtext exists in the haunted music and hum interplay. The piece avoids sermonizing but remains more told than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.3)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and enduring love are clear but largely asserted and repeated. Subtext is thin; motifs (locket, jetty) don’t shift meaning in a way that complicates the thesis. The ending moralizes via future retrospection, softening resonance. Emotional aftereffect is pleasant yet generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of connection, reciprocity, and myth versus community are coherent and consistent with the images. However, the piece undercuts subtext by explicitly stating its thesis (“The cure for loneliness was not…”) in the final third, veering into moralizing. The moon rock’s deflation into communal action is a sound thematic turn but arrives explained rather than felt. Ambiguity and counter‑currents are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Harmony between outer world and inner grief emerges through motifs (notes, ring, tattoos). Some lines lean toward statement (“understood the hidden harmonies of the universe”) rather than image‑driven implication. The ending resonates, but the insight feels slightly declared. Subtext is present but not richly conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of authorship, responsibility, and reframed failure emerge coherently from the pen and seeds motifs. The weeds revaluation offers mild resonance at the end. Some lines verge on telling the thesis rather than letting subtext accrue through action. Still, the closing sanctuary image carries conceptual echo.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of memory, translation, and connection are coherent and echoed through sign language and the empty camera. However, several lines articulate thesis directly (“it became clear… not just about sound but about connection”), edging into told moral. The final image reweights the premise effectively without fully escaping abstraction. The melancholic/joyful braid reads honest if a touch stated.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of art as preservation, love/loyalty, and time’s palimpsest emerge through recurring images, especially the smile in the tapestry. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“testament to the power of art”), muting subtext. The ending’s touch on the tapestry offers resonance but stops short of a surprising reweighting. Ambiguity exists, but it feels safe rather than challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of interconnection, collective memory, and the beauty/cost of transience cohere, especially in the dimming lagoon and the resolve to continue. Some thematic statements read declared (“meant to untangle,” “amplify this connection”), softening subtext. The final image offers a gentle, resonant answer—endure and nurture despite loss—but veers toward sentiment. Still, the auroral sorrow recurs with integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of quiet power accrues through setting and final whisper, but it is also stated outright (“sometimes it was the quietest voices...”), edging into moralizing. The maps/coin/key suggest secrecy and hidden orders, but their thematic integration is surface‑level. Resonance exists yet remains gentle and unsurprising. The final image reweights little beyond reaffirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motifs (mirror, shutters, reflection) triangulate a theme of recognition without speech, but the explicit thesis (“teach darkness the value of stars”) overstates and flattens nuance. Subtext operates in gaze and gesture effectively, especially in the mirrored weaving. The ending image of stars reweights calm over tension, if gently. Overall resonance is present but partly told.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of deliberation and communal pause are coherent and recur via “forests of second thoughts” and “amplified quiet.” Yet the piece often states its thesis rather than letting subtext do the lifting. The ending offers resonance without a moral, but insight feels lightly earned because conflict is low. Symbolism leans declarative over discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Symbols (disappearing island, scrimshaw, whale call) accumulate into a coherent meditation on self‑liberation. The conceptual reprice (“island” as state) is elegant, but the text occasionally states theme directly (“violence was becoming a relic”), dulling subtext. The final image resonates without didactic moral, though it brushes sentimentality. The motifs work together rather than as a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Grief transmuted by art and memory is coherently developed through recurring images (bouquet, turbines, narration) and the end’s quiet “glimmer of hope.” Some lines lean into telling—e.g., naming the Happiness Mandate’s legacy—rather than letting subtext do the work. Still, the final hush reweights prior material without moralizing. Thematic integration is strong if not revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—art dissolves limits and reconfigures reality—emerges through images (blurred self/landscape, pulsing quartz) and closes coherently. However, lines like “a testament to the power of art” and “transformative power of art” state the thesis, reducing subtext. The piece invites reflection but skews toward assertion over implication. Complexity is limited by the absence of counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme is clear (imperfection as beauty, awakening through exchange) but heavily told and occasionally lapses into moralizing summaries. Some resonance accrues via the phoenix motif and the plant/concertina reprise. Subtext is light; complexity and counterpressure are missing, softening impact. The ending invites reflection but not a reweighing with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of connection and resonance are coherent but often told outright, flattening subtext. The lens as symbol gestures toward meaning yet the piece leans on declarations (“a journey to discover the texture of connection”). The ending’s self‑referential note diminishes lingering resonance. Little moral or conceptual reweighting occurs on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (grief transmuted into beauty; withering to bloom) is coherent, with the flower stencil and soft rekindling returning at the end. Subtext is diluted by direct statements (“Their craft… had become a means of healing”), edging into moralizing. The final image offers gentle resonance but little ambiguity or friction. The piece invites reflection, but not a re‑weighting that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Coherent themes of inherited craft, post‑crash meaning‑making, and pattern versus destiny accrue through recurring images. The piece sometimes states its theses (“using it as a lens to examine underlying structures,” “uncovering hidden narratives”) rather than letting subtext do the lift. Final images (tape in pocket, empty loft as beacon) carry some resonance but edge toward overt summary. The ambiguity is purposeful but lacks a hard reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (nostalgia as an element that reconfigures perception; end of innocence) is present but often labeled outright. Resonance arises from recurring images (twilight, pagoda) yet slides toward summary in the aftermath. Some lines verge on platitude, muting subtext. Still, the final reweighting coheres concept and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres around collective fear, shared dreams, and guarding hope, with recurring images (stone, orbs, library) supporting it. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“Her motivation was… to preserve the shape of hope,” “the shadow… a manifestation of humanity’s deepest fears”), dampening subtext. The final image does resonate, if gently. Insights arise more from assertion than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme coheres around shedding convictions and reconciling compassion with self-respect; the chameleon motif earns resonance in the last image. However, the piece frequently states its thesis directly, diluting subtext. Insights feel more declared than wrestled from conflict. Quiet ending lands, but moralization edges in.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of wounding, reading scars, and interconnection surface through recurring images (hourglass, rings, plants) and culminate in a quiet reweighting. Some lines tilt toward tell (“displaced miracle,” “tissue of reality”) rather than letting scene make the claim. The final image invites reflection but skirts a sharper, earned ambiguity or price. Resonance is present, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Resonance arises from the film/letter imagery, culminating in a conceptual reweighting of love as energy carried forward. However, the theme is repeatedly stated in overt terms (“a testament to the enduring power of love”), edging into moralizing. Subtext yields to declaration at key moments. The ending’s image works, but subtlety is undercut by explicit theses.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme (listening to the cosmos to unbind creativity) coheres through recurring images and the dawn reprisal. The subtext stays mostly on the surface; moments flirt with platitude (“rest was essential”) rather than deriving insight solely from action. Still, the closing image reweights the night with quiet resonance. Added ambiguity or moral friction could deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Time, memory, and rebirth accrue through the chess clock and “last forest burns” to a cohesive, elegiac answer: renewal can be coaxed from ruin with attention. The clock’s shift from frozen to beating is a strong thematic turn. Subtext (custody of knowledge vs. self‑dissolution) is present but under‑pressured, keeping the resonance more pretty than piercing. No moralizing; the final image invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme (mind as frontier; communion with a machinic nature) coheres via recurring images. The final image reweights the rainforest as gateway, but explicit lines (“probable miracles,” “infinite possibilities”) veer toward platitude. Subtext exists in the symbiosis of gear/hum/wind, though it’s asserted as often as it’s implied. Resonance is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of guidance, commitment, and latent courage are coherent and image-led (stamp, vigil, threshold). Repetition (“unused courage,” “gentle persistence”) leans toward platitude and reduces subtext. The final threshold image offers resonance but little complexity or counter-pressure. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of silence, safety, and identity surface organically in a few images (discoloration path; the bolt’s mundane repair), but the piece leans on explicit statements (“They came to see… it was a choice…”) that blunt subtext. The final repricing—silence as strength—lands, yet feels told rather than earned through pressure. A more image-led answer at the end would deepen resonance. The figure’s fleeting connection is strong but underexploited.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of truth, patience, and scholarly craft defeating ambition emerge, aided by the marginalia motif. Subtext is present but light; the final paragraph edges toward moralizing (“a reminder of the power of truth”). The “graceful collapse” tone hints at reconfiguration but doesn’t deepen ethical complexity. Resonance lingers more by image than argument.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres around data versus lived rhythm and the humility of not-knowing; recurring sonic motifs support it. However, the statement “the truth she sought was not in the maps or the data” veers into overt moralizing. The final image reweights earlier details with some resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of stillness as power and the re‑ignition of conviction emerge through images (hum, stones, refracted starlight) rather than lecture. Some phrasing edges toward statement (“find meaning in the mess”) but the closing image reweights prior motifs. Subtext is present in object reprise and environmental echo. Complexity remains moderate, with minimal counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of tradition vs. evolution and kinship with land emerge, but they are asserted rather than earned (“evolve tradition with intent,” “implanted destiny unfolding”). Subtext is limited because the outcome lacks friction; the piece gestures toward fate’s cost but doesn’t dramatize it. The final image is serene rather than reweighting the premise with unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of healing and hope emerge through specific images (twisted trees softening, photograph smoothing), but explicit moralizing (“even in the darkest of times, there was always hope”) blunts subtext. The final resolve carries resonance, though sentimentality edges in. The conceptual idea of stillness is present, but complexity is limited by the neatness of the ending. Strong motifs; softer, implied answers would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—art as a conduit through necessary darkness—emerges through recurring images (fragments, threads, lighthouse beam) and resolves with a non‑literal answer. Some lines edge toward thesis-stating via rhetorical questions, softening subtext. Still, the final repricing (darkness as beginning) reweights earlier motifs. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.3)
    Patterns, disappearance, and eclipse-time cohere into a theme of perception and ephemerality. The ink motif earns some resonance in the final “map etched in disappearing ink” image. Yet the piece underlines its thesis (“a tale of patterns and time, of mystery and revelation”), edging into tell. The insight is gentle and persuasive but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    Themes of censorship, complicity, and truth emerge, but they’re often stated outright (“scandalize the status quo,” “forcing a reevaluation”) rather than earned via subtext. The final paragraphs tilt toward moral summary, dulling resonance. Snow/quiet motifs provide a frame, yet they don’t meaningfully reprice earlier images. The piece invites reflection but edges into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—peaceful cultivation over violence—emerges through the sword/rose counterpoint and the “engraved quiet” motif. However, it’s spelled out rather than earned through conflict, edging toward sermonizing in the final paragraphs. The imagery resonates but doesn’t complicate itself with counter‑pressures. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of silence-as-speech, pattern-break as access to the sacred, and reciprocity with landscape cohere through images rather than moralizing. The final pattern “settling” reweights the premise subtly, offering a modest conceptual repricing. Resonance is genuine but mild because costs are light and contradictions are underplayed. Still, the goddess’s “voice in the silences” motif earns its return.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (truth vs legacy/regret) is coherent and recurs, but signaled overtly (“power of truth,” “orbits of regret”) rather than earned through scene consequences. The talisman motif offers potential subtext that isn’t exploited in action. The ending offers a conceptual answer (choose truth) but skirts complexity by avoiding a real ethical cost. Resonance is present but generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Haunted firmware as guilt externalized, the letters as grief conduit, and the meteor hush as earned calm cohere into a theme of translating pain into art. The ending offers a resonant image rather than a moral, but the relief reads slightly neat. The amber and baby-cry motifs reprise effectively, if somewhat on-the-nose. Ambiguity lingers in a good way about art absorbing dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around unlearning and radical attention (“listen deeply”) realized through image rather than lecture, with a quiet repricing at the end. The lilac unease modulates from threat to companion, offering a nuanced, non‑moralized answer. Some phrasing veers toward abstraction, softening subtextual bite. Still, the closing image reweights prior motifs without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rebirth and “aberrant mercy” are thematically coherent, yet the text often states its thesis (“The act of renaming was not simply…”, “a testament to the transformative power…”) instead of letting images bear the weight. The final paragraphs tilt into moralizing, dulling subtext. The tessera and renaming could carry resonance if more was left unsaid. Emotional aftereffect persists but feels guided rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of nostalgia, redemption, and possibility accrue through repeated images (echoes, coin, garden). Final paragraphs tip into moralizing—“reminder of the power of nostalgia”—dulling subtext. The ending answers the question (peace vs. haunting) but with limited ambivalence or cost. Resonance lingers more by motif than by earned reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres: art/science fusion, embodied intuition over pharmacology, and a fragile “willowglass” hope that reframes setback as opening. The geode’s recurrence anchors meaning without heavy symbolism. Some lines slip into telling (“Her motivation was clear”) which blunts subtext. Still, the dawn image and charged poise offer a modest, resonant answer.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    Transitional objects and bridging past/present thread through the fossil and mapping but are asserted more than dramatized. Thematic insight (“voice of the unknown,” “at peace”) arrives as declaration instead of arising from a pressured choice. The final image glows but does not reprice the premise with cost. Resonance is pleasant, not penetrating.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme is coherent—knowledge as communal, prophecy as possibility—but often stated rather than earned through conflict. Phrases like “a beacon of shared wisdom” and “the alchemy of shared wisdom” veer into thesis‑like moralizing, especially in the final third. Subtext is overshadowed by declarative abstraction. The images carry resonance, but the piece tells us its meaning too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of mending, courage, and self‑reconciliation recur via mist, burn scars, pillbox, and seasonal tilt. The final image offers hope, but several lines verge on direct statement (“world was full of possibility”), dulling subtext. The “unused courage” motif reweights earlier beats, though with a tidy uplift that risks sentimentality. Resonance is present but not layered with counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of essence versus complexity and layered meaning are present via recurring images (fog clearing, palimpsest, needle/thread). However, some lines stray toward abstract declaration rather than emergent insight (“distilled complexity into simplicity”). The final tableau offers a quiet, resonant answer—understanding shared—but avoids deeper ambiguity or counter‑pressure. The emotional aftereffect is pleasing more than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme—kindness as a force that resists change—emerges, but is articulated outright (“the answer to her question...”) rather than fully earned through subtext. The recurring images (glass, thrum, smoke) support resonance, if gently. Sentiment edges toward tidy consolation without counter‑pressure. The final repricing is pleasing yet safe.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.7)
    Resonances among flower/boat/tooth are evocative, and the final image reframes care as guardianship. However, theme is sometimes stated rather than earned (“goal… to reflect light into the dark corners”), damping subtext. The lockmaster parallel invites subtext but isn’t tested in scene. The aftereffect is tender but not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, extinction, and reconfiguring isolation recur, but are often asserted (“translate the isolation… into independence,” “brittle awakenings”) rather than earned through conflict. The sundial as light/shadow metaphor coheres, and the final “coexistence” note resonates mildly. Overt thematic naming dampens subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—connection through communal creation—emerges, but is articulated overtly (“she realized that the thread… was not something to be found, but something to be created”). Subtext exists in the twig/spiral and temple imagery, yet the final paragraphs lean into moralizing summary, reducing resonance. The insight feels true but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.7)
    Themes of balance, harmony, and agency against “cosmic tricksters” are stated rather than emerging through subtext. The closing moral affirmations (“true calling,” “restore balance”) flatten ambiguity. No image reweights earlier material with cost; resonance relies on aspiration instead of dramatic payoff. The motifs (charts, frequencies) don’t deepen into thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of discovery, surrender to the unknown, and the reframing of value are coherent and seeded through recurring images (organ, crystal, starlight, fallow period). However, lines that declare meaning (“the vital key…was…a profound insight”) tilt toward telling and tidy moralization. The final wistfulness resonates, but ambiguity and counter‑pressure could deepen. Subtext rides image, though occasionally undercut by explicative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (empathy as the key; unity of opposites; masks/identity) is stated rather than discovered, with lines like “empathy was the key” carrying the thesis. Subtext exists in the ribbon and mist but is overshadowed by direct moralizing. The ending offers a quiet answer but verges on neatness (“a truth worth capturing”). Resonance emerges, though it’s more told cadence than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.7)
    Themes of inheritance, pattern‑seeking, and “reversible exile” are evocative, yet handled mostly through assertion. Subtext glints around the nail and coded stanzas but doesn’t transform meaning at closure. The ending gestures at profundity without earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of art as transformation and redemption are coherent and recurrent. However, they are often stated rather than earned through dramatic friction (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’,” repeated). Subtext is thin because conflict remains low; the piece leans on lyric assertion. The final cadence resonates softly but skirts sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme is coherent (value, transience, paths, markers), but it is often stated outright (“the value of a journey…”), reducing subtext. Recurring images (money, markers, harmony) echo rather than transform, with limited reweighting at the end. The final paragraphs verge on moralizing instead of letting images carry the resonance. Insight feels tidy and low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of shared burdens and understanding is coherent but heavily told and repeated. Moments like the daylily telegram could carry subtext, yet the story explains its meaning instead of letting gesture bear weight. The ending’s solace lands, though it veers toward sentimental certainty. Complexity and counter‑pressure are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of perception versus reflection and recovery of the lost accrue through the frozen confession and mirror, but the key thesis is stated outright (“What mirrors don’t show... is... a glimpse into the soul”), dulling subtext. The reunion with the past figure could have deepened ambiguity, yet it’s handled declaratively. The final image reweights meaning modestly without a felt ethical or relational cost. Some resonance, limited by on‑the‑nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of hidden patterns, vocation vs. calling, and covenant-as-blueprint are coherent and reprise at the end. However, several lines state the thesis (“possibilities were endless,” “hidden blueprint”) rather than letting it arise from action. Resonance exists but shies from complexity or counter‑pressure. The final insight is pleasing yet low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of self‑entrapment and self‑rewriting accrue through the Eight of Swords and “bartered destinies.” The final image reweights the card as talisman, which resonates. However, the piece leans on overt statements (“to patch holes in her soul,” “bartered her destiny”) rather than subtextual revelation. Ambiguity exists but complexity is limited by the tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of identity after applause and the seduction of quiet versus the hunger for risk are present, anchored by the cloth motif. Yet the piece leans on explicit moralizing (“The silence was no longer oppressive, but a reminder...,” “a symphony of possibilities”), especially in the final paragraphs, muting subtext. Resonance skews declarative over earned implication. A quieter, image‑led cadence would deepen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interconnectedness and “physics of transition” are thematically coherent, but they’re articulated rather than earned through concrete struggle. The final insight (“relationships between components”) reads like thesis exposition. Little subtext emerges from action or image beyond repeated symbolism. Resonance is muted by the low on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (fluid identity, wonder in routine) resonates through images like the creel and the tidal cadence. However, key theses are stated outright (“motivation became clear”), blunting subtext. The final image is gentle but offers limited reweighting or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme centers on connection, receptivity to others’ burdens, and transforming objects into vessels of meaning. Resonance comes through recurring images (pearl, shell, radiance) but is undercut by explicit statements (“the power to connect with others lay within”) that verge on moralizing. The final image reweights earlier material but explains more than it lets subtext do work. Complexity is limited by platitudinal phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme is explicit and repeats (“forgiveness is a journey, not a destination”), edging into platitude and reducing subtext. Some images—the taped bellows, ivy reclaiming the station—carry resonance. But the bathroom graffiti aphorism over-explains what the images already suggest. The ending offers mood more than a reweighted thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    Recurring motifs (cipher, watch, whispers) support a theme of translating the unspoken into lived awareness. The ending’s explicit line—“not a destination, but a state of being”—states the thesis rather than letting the final image carry it, dulling resonance. Still, the reweighting from quest to stance lands. Ambiguity is gentle rather than generative.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of agency versus fate (perforated destiny) coheres through the violin, stains, and final step. The piece resists a tidy moral, ending on a charged readiness. Some thematic lines are told outright (“no matter the cost”), dulling subtext. Still, the closing image reframes prior motifs with a quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Beauty-as-ritual against mortality accrues through object and method, not didactic thesis. The emerald’s reweighted meaning and the sentinel grotto offer a non‑literal answer about acceptance and readiness. A few overt statements (“fragment of the divine”) brush sentimentality, but the images hold. Subtext of craft as elegy is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (rebirth, forgiveness, contentment) aligns with recurring images (hairpin, trees, clouds) and culminates in a mild reframing. Yet the piece often states its themes outright instead of letting them accrue through action, edging into sentimentality. The final insight is predictable and low‑friction. Some resonance lingers but lacks complexity or counter‑currents.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of nuance versus certainty and protected vulnerability are explicitly stated rather than earned through conflicted action. Recurring objects (chimes, shard) gesture toward subtext but are mostly interpreted for the reader. Final image offers a modest reframing, yet moralizing lines (“to welcome nuance into certainty”) flatten ambiguity. The piece invites reflection but tells us what to think too often.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—delayed revelation/truth through perception—threads via ripples and the final comprehension. Yet it’s often stated rather than dramatized (“Her motivation was…”, “The key… lay in…”). The closing image reaffirms understanding without a reweighting cost, tilting toward platitude. Subtext is gentle, not probing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Harmony, reverence, and stillness‑as‑movement emerge organically through image chains (echoes, birds, pulse). The ending’s repricing—movement found in stillness—resonates without a stated moral. A few lines tilt toward declarative abstraction (“secrets of the universe”), softening the edge. Overall, the thematic arc coheres and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of automation vs. art and “the sacred in the simple” are overtly stated, especially in the final third, limiting subtext. The closing insight repeats the thesis rather than reweighting via implication. The keystone’s glow does offer a resonant image, but the piece drifts toward moral clarity without complicating tension. Earned wisdom is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme centers on revelation as vow: light, sound, and truth interwoven. The final image reweights earlier motifs but edges into telling (“not just a concept, but a reality”; “a doorway to a new understanding”). Subtext lives mostly in the contrast between revelers above and his solitary descent. Resonance is present, but the piece occasionally explains what the image already implies.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of fate, alignment, and knowledge-through-ritual emerge coherently from the particulars. However, lines like “they had fulfilled their role” tip into telling and dampen subtext. The final image offers resonance but little ambivalence or conceptual cost. Symbolism feels intact yet safe.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of sacrifice, memory, and naming the unknown accrue organically through the atlas/sea/echo motif. The final whisper of a “forgotten name” offers a resonant, non-literal answer about giving voice to fear. Some phrasing leans declarative (“echo of sacrifice”) and repeats enough to feel on-the-nose. Still, the piece avoids moralizing and earns a contemplative aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of devotion’s fragility and restoration recur via the cracked bell and measured dripping. Some lines lapse into thesis‑like abstraction (“brittle devotion,” “cosmic imbalance,” “plausible impossibility”). The final toll reweights prior imagery but skirts sentimentality by stating effects (a “new era”) rather than letting implication carry them. Resonance is present but not layered with contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of memory, narrative, and communal healing are coherent but often told outright (“to expunge the pain,” “spin stories into shared meaning”). Recurring objects (liqueur label, wind chime) lightly reweight the ending, though the resonance leans on assertion. The piece resists a pat moral, but its insights are stated more than earned through turns. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of wonder and the logic/intuition braid are coherent and image‑led (starling patterns as language), but they’re also stated outright multiple times. Insight feels earned via observation, yet the resonance leans lyrical more than ambivalent or complex. The last paragraphs verge on summarizing significance instead of letting implication carry it. The piece invites reflection, but avoids deeper friction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of vigilance, trust, and responsibility emerge through images (buckle, dawn) but are also stated directly, diluting subtext. The final cadence offers a gentle repricing—work persists with pride and cost. Resonance is present but risks sentimentality via reiterated formulations (“watcher’s burden,” “trust placed in her”). Complexity is suggested more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Identity beyond duplication and balance via contradictions is coherent and seeded by the jar motif. Subtext is undercut by direct assertion (“He was free to be himself,” “had finally found...”), which flattens resonance. The ending offers a conceptual answer but edges into thematic telling. Still, the object’s reweighting (from taunt to memento) gives a workable echo.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of receptivity, mystery as catalyst, and safeguarding creative space emerge coherently through images (seed, brook, night into dawn). Some lines risk platitude or self‑summary, especially near the end where the thesis is articulated. The final image (seed as emblem beside the outlined plan) offers a modest reweighting rather than a hard epiphany. Subtext is present but not combative or ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of tending to the unspoken and music as healing arise organically from the act of conducting and the house’s response. However, explicit thesis-like phrases (“a testament to the power of tending to the unspoken,” “a true haunting”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. The final image still resonates as a quiet repricing of grief into bittersweet beauty. Emotional honesty is intact if somewhat declared.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of knowledge’s light versus ignorance’s dark and acceptance of uncertainty recur and culminate in a repriced pendant and peaceful vigil. Some lines state insights directly (“grasp the true nature…”) rather than letting subtext carry them. The final image resonates but skirts moral neatness. Strong coherence, modest overtness.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of creative destruction refashions authority (broken crozier → catalyst for rebirth) and aligns with agency vs. fate. Some lines tip into telling (“not mere curiosity… interrupt a stifling destiny”), dulling subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs without a didactic moral. Resonance lingers, though complexity is constrained by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.4)
    Resonance emerges, but explicit theme statements (“find the beginning in every ending”; “reminder… beauty in decay”) blunt subtext. The recurring star fragment and hush motif gesture toward impermanence and memory, yet the piece tells its meanings rather than letting images carry them. The final moral color reads tidy and low‑friction, softening aftereffect. Some lyric images hint at deeper haunt that the prose then explains away.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of permeability between worlds and “permanent transient‑ness” are coherent and reprise in the hourglass/sideways clocks motif. However, several thematic lines are told outright (“restore balance to the cosmos,” “merge parallel timelines”), muting subtext. The ending image resonates but doesn’t reprice the premise with a felt cost or a non‑literal answer beyond stated wonder. The piece gestures toward profundity more than it distills it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—rational enchantment—is consistent and organically tied to images of pattern and perception. However, it’s stated outright multiple times, blunting subtext. The closing image of carrying the thread achieves a modest repricing of the world’s connectedness. Complexity is suggested (dependence, altered memory) but not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of horizons, learning, and cosmic humility recur, but are often stated rather than dramatized. The anchor’s reprise nudges resonance, yet the piece leans on declarative moralizing in late lines. Subtext is thin because conflict is absent. The final image as beacon of hope is pleasant but conceptually inexpensive.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory as presence and “protecting vulnerable voices” emerge via the hearing aid and the mist’s response, culminating in a quiet, resonant farewell. However, the piece leans on declaratives (“incidental heroism,” “to keep the memories of the dead alive”), edging toward stated thesis rather than subtext. The final hum image works, but subtlety is sometimes traded for summary. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and communion with “invisible things” are present, with the “crashing hush” motif tying concept to feeling. However, several thematic statements are told outright (“to stand by the unremembered”) rather than earned through friction. The ending’s peace is pleasant but risks sentimentality without a palpable loss or moral cost. Subtext lingers lightly but lacks a reweighting surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (ink, snow, shard, heartbeat) align to a theme of gleaning wisdom from fracture and failure, culminating in a gentle repricing at dawn. However, the line “She realized that her journey was not about…” veers into thesis‑statement territory, diluting subtext. The ending image carries resonance but skirts sentimentality. Ambiguity is present without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Art as translation across loss is coherent and resonant; the flawed diamond and flock patterns reprise meaningfully in the ending. Some lines veer toward thesis‑like assertion (“a testament to the power of art to transcend even death”). Still, the final image reweights the opening premise with a credible, earned lyric charge. Ambiguity remains purposeful rather than confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of facing darkness by reframing it (“cosmic joke”) and harnessing a dangerous harmony are coherent. However, the piece states its theses outright (“It was a power that could be harnessed…”) rather than letting events imply them. Symbolic objects recur but read as illustrations rather than drivers of meaning. The ending resonates softly without a deep reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of restoration and resistance to mechanization emerge through recurring images (music, statues, locust shell), but they’re reinforced by explicit statements that verge on moralizing. Subtext exists (fragility versus rigidity), yet insight is told rather than earned via fraught choices. The final note reiterates the thesis more than it reweights it. Resonance lingers, but complexity is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hope versus surveillance/dereliction of promises threads through the storm-in-a-bottle motif and the delivery act. However, the final paragraphs verge on direct thematic statement (“hope and redemption”), blunting subtext. The motif does reweight the last image, lending resonance. Complexity is present but tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of silence, stillness, and possibility emerge coherently via recurring images and the charged return to craft. However, lines like “they had discovered a hidden truth” edge into explicit statement, dulling subtext. The final image (wind bells, halo gleam, renewed work) resonates, if gently. Ambiguity around the singer’s reality supports reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of stories as living entities and art/science entwined are clear, but often told outright (“She believed…”) rather than earned through friction. The scarf’s glow and the hum of stories give some resonance at the end. Ambiguity is limited; the piece affirms rather than interrogates its premise. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of art as pursuit of an ungraspable code is coherent and resonates with the final endurance stance. Recurring images (dawn, palette, light as cipher) accrue meaning, though phrasing veers toward conceptual assertion over dramatized subtext. The quiet ending invites reflection without tidy moralizing. Greater friction or cost would deepen the thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of liberating memory/idea and cosmic interconnectedness accrue through image and ritual. Some lines slide toward telling (“It was said that…”) instead of letting subtext do the work. The final shimmer reweights the premise gently but avoids sharper ambiguity or cost. Resonance is present, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Memory, pattern, and adaptability cohere as themes, with the mushroom and stars as resonant images. However, explicit statements (“it was essential to be adaptable,” “doors of perception”) tilt toward telling, edging into mild moralizing. The final image reaffirms nostalgia and resolve but stops short of a reweighting that complicates prior material. Subtext exists mostly in the haunted setting rather than in on‑page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of exile, return, and tutored resilience arise through image systems (mirror-shard, shadow, tea geometry) and the charged hush. Some thematic statements are explicit (“to mentor resilience quietly”), slightly reducing subtext. The closing image reweights prior motifs toward wholeness and care without lapsing into platitude. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme (renewal, interconnectedness, art as bridge) is coherent but often stated rather than earned through conflict. Repeated declarations (“color of wonder,” “essence of the land”) drift toward slogan, weakening subtext. The final “radiant hush” image carries some resonance, yet moralizing phrasing dilutes complexity. Lacks a countercurrent or friction that would deepen the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Silence as craft and cost coheres with themes of restoration, memory, and release; the hush transforming into a vessel for the spirits lands. The needle/net motif reblooms at the end without moralizing. Repetition edges toward overstatement (“interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence”), slightly dulling the subtext’s bite. Still, the closing reweights prior images with a quiet, earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Listening to silence, empathy, and reassembly of the “torn map” cohere and the final image reweights prior motifs. Repetitions (“whispered chapel,” “silence”) drift toward stated theme rather than subtextual accrual. Resonance lands, but borders on platitude in the last third.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of release vs. reframing is integrated through objects and actions, culminating in the still snow globe and ascent. Occasional explicit statements (“To let go is not to release, but to reframe”) edge into didacticism, slightly dulling subtext. The “last transmission” reweights prior material effectively. Emotional aftertaste is earned, sophisticated, and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of expression as translation, code as haunting, and self‑discovery through making accrue plausibly through images and repeated “encoding” motifs. However, the piece often states its themes outright (“to articulate unspoken needs”) instead of letting subtext carry them. The final breeze/mural image resonates but remains comfortable. A thornier ambiguity or price would deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of love as twin joy/sorrow and reframing isolation as sanctuary emerge through image and setting. Yet several lines state thesis directly (“a testament to the enduring power of human connection”), edging toward summary. The final repricing resonates but avoids complexity or counter‑pressure. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of legacy, memory-in-absence, and unity after rupture recur through the telescope and cloud taxonomy and culminate in “spooled wholeness.” Some lines verge on thesis statements, softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without a spelled‑out moral. The reverence for weather’s interiority carries emotional afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Impermanence vs. the urge to capture the infinite coheres through the final image of the sky “inside” the walls. However, the explicit line about “the limits of human understanding and the futility of seeking to capture the infinite” overstates what the scene shows. The coin as a motif helps move theme from abstraction toward embodiment. The ending’s resonance is earned but not layered with subtext beyond the central binary.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: curiosity and solitude within a communal vessel, the ethics of withholding discovery, and the intimacy of attention creating connection. Recurring images (pen scratch, starlings’ murmuration, luminance) gather resonance without overt moralizing. The final readiness reweights the motif of “sociable isolation.” Depth is felt but not piercingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motifs (gears, mirrors, morning hush) coherently point to time’s repair and belonging. The final image reaffirms theme but leans on telling (“their craft… about understanding the intricate dance of the universe”), edging toward platitude. Subtext is present but not sharp; complexity and counterpressure are limited. Resonance is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of communal trust, stewardship, and interdependence emerge coherently from the collective effort and the bell/garden motifs. However, resonance leans toward sentimentality and is told rather than distilled into charged images with cost. The final harmony feels earned conceptually, not emotionally. Subtext is thin; symbols function decoratively more than adversarially.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Fragility/beauty and care‑through‑brokenness resonate via the puppet head and “beautifully flawed” refrain. The lullaby across time offers a quiet, non‑literal answer about stewardship. Some lines drift toward thematic telling (“to preserve the beauty…”) instead of letting images carry it. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs with a gentle aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of stewardship, memory as map, and turning a peril into a guide accrue through blueprint and path imagery. The glowing nut reprise gestures toward legacy and small triggers of change. Resonance is pleasant but tidy; ambiguity and cost are underplayed, trimming depth. No moralizing, but also little subtextual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.6)
    Transformation/connection vs. separation is coherent, with natural images (foam, chrysalis) supporting it. However, the piece states its thesis overtly (“perfect metaphor,” “using her knowledge to bring people and things together”), tipping into moralizing and reducing subtext. The epiphany is more declared than dramatized. Resonance is present but safe and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of attention vs. extraction, place as narrative, and preservation-as-reading emerge coherently from events and images. Some moments state the thesis too plainly (“place where stories begin”), softening subtext. The final repricing of “glimmering parole” is resonant, if somewhat announced. Emotional afterglow is achieved through atmosphere more than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of remorse, healing, and endurance accumulate through recurring images (rain-damp walls, coral, tides). The final calm reweights the premise without overt moralizing, though some lines state theme directly (“Elara had sandpapered the rough memories”). Subtext glimmers in ocean-in-desert and brittle-sturdy echoes but remains relatively explicit. Resonance is present if not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of bridging past and progress, time’s guardianship, and communal harmony are coherent and image‑driven. Subtext remains thin because the piece tells the outcome (“efforts had borne fruit”) instead of letting images carry the cost and ambiguity. The mechanical/organic dialogue metaphor is promising but resolves too tidily. Resonance lingers as mood rather than as a reweighted moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of memory, abandonment, and self-reconfiguration are coherent and recur via the mirror. Some phrasing (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) reads like thesis language rather than subtext. The final image reweights earlier detail, but the insight is asserted more than earned through conflict. Resonance lingers, albeit softly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonant motifs (serpent/seed, threshold, inversion) feed a theme of knowledge’s cultivation and responsibility. The final image (“latent blaze… guide her”) offers a quiet, earned poise without sermonizing, though one line spells out responsibility explicitly. Subtext is present but not layered with competing impulses or moral friction. The piece invites reflection more through atmosphere than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of restoring connection and reweaving silence into felt music are coherent and arise from concrete acts of making. The late repricing—silence persists yet is gentled—offers a quiet, resonant answer. Some lines state theme directly (“deep motivation: to create music that could be felt”), softening subtext. Still, the recurring objects (cracks, strings, insulator) carry honest emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of translating silence and finding beauty in difficulty recur and cohere with exile. Some lines veer toward statement (“he had vowed to uncover a new truth”) rather than earned subtext. The final image (walking into darkness with hopeful melancholy) resonates, but the insight feels lightly earned due to minimal friction. Still, the chess pedagogy and nexus lend a distinct thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.9)
    Silence and empathy recur coherently, but thematic statements are often told (“The core concept of empathy…”), diluting subtext. The best resonance arrives in the fireworks holding their breath, a strong image that reframes quiet as charged. Insight is gentle and sincere yet risks sentimentality. The ending offers a stance more than a deep reweighting with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme coheres around serenity within motion and wisdom’s immanence, carried by scent and pattern motifs. Yet the piece states its thesis outright (“not something to be discovered, but… always present”) rather than letting subtext do the work. The doodle motif gestures toward pattern recognition but stops short of a charged, non‑literal answer. Resonance lingers softly, not decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Wonder, resilience, and interdependence emerge through the echoes and accelerated growth, with the final “re-seeing” of the orchard and universe. However, thematic statements are sometimes told (“She knew that she had discovered something profound”), reducing subtext. The arrow’s resonance hints at a compelling sub‑theme (history embedded in living systems) but isn’t fully developed. The ending image charges meaning but avoids complexity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of foresight, human factors, and pattern recognition emerge from the survey and the patch. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“driven by a desire to cultivate foresight in action,” “lessons were learned”), reducing subtext. The patch as symbol nearly connects human stakes to method but remains largely declarative. Resonance is present but not earned through reversal or charged implication.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of art revealing deeper truths and wonder as essential are clear and resonant with the finale’s hush. However, the story sometimes states its thesis (“to certify wonder…”) instead of letting images alone carry it. The ending offers a gentle repricing of the world through Elian’s gaze, not a hard-earned revelation. Subtext is present but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of failure-as-instruction, stillness, and threshold‑crossing emerge through concrete images (markers, vibrating air, charged quiet). A few lines tilt toward telling (“To harvest insights from failure was her true motivation”). The final image of the flute’s inner glow and her changed stance offers a non‑literal answer that lingers. Complexity is present but not startling.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of translation of feeling through form and language accumulate through presswork and the “deliberate ambiguity” print. The ending reframes the quest as a beginning, offering quiet resonance without overt moralizing. Some thematic phrasing is abstract or familiar (“exhilarating and terrifying”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the Halo/letterpress synthesis carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (wonder as connective tissue) is coherent but over-articulated, leaning on direct statements like “Eira’s task was not just to retrieve relics, but to coax wonder…” rather than letting action imply it. The final image resonates gently yet skirts sentimentality by asserting purpose rather than earning it through conflict. Subtext exists in the liminal imagery but remains safe. The absence of friction limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of perception, parity between natural patterns and human emotion, and paradox (“truthful lies”) are asserted rather than earned through action. Final paragraphs lapse into moralizing (“a truth that was both simple and profound”) which flattens resonance. The recurring images don’t transform meaningfully at closure beyond affirming the premise. Subtext remains thin because conflict never forces a reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of patience, connection, and reweaving are coherently threaded through puzzle/loom imagery. Some lines veer toward statement (“a testament to the power of love and determination”), softening subtext. Resonance exists but is cushioned by sentiment and lacks a counter‑pressure that would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Transformation through resourcefulness (“bartered awakenings,” resilience from rubble) coheres as theme and returns in the final mentorship turn. Some lines overstate the thesis, edging toward abstraction. The closing gesture reweights solitude vs. legacy, but ambiguity and subtext are modest. Resonance comes more from repetition than earned paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme centers on pattern recognition and withheld truth, but it’s asserted rather than earned through textured scene work. The green shard’s reprise adds light resonance, yet lines like “she knew she would never see the multiverse in the same way again” flatten subtext into statement. The piece invites reflection, but ambiguity lacks consequence. The conceptual shift lands, though it feels generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of watchfulness, communal signaling, and the desire to fix safety in a dangerous world emerge organically from objects and ritual. The final image (blue ember, sentinel lighthouse) reframes earlier motifs with earned tenderness. Repetition of “luminescent ache” risks overstatement but doesn’t collapse into moralizing. The letter motif promises a paranoia thread that isn’t developed thematically beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.7)
    Tradition vs. a fleeting digital world and light/shadow as craft vs. chaos are coherent themes. However, they are stated directly (“In a world after the last print newspaper…”) rather than earned through subtext. The final image resonates modestly but avoids complication or counterpressure. Symbolic recurrence is present but not reweighted with evident cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The refracting/reflecting motif coheres with the idea of certain people “magnetizing stories.” Yet theme is partially told (“Kaito realized…”) rather than earned strictly through image and action. The final image is resonant but safe, with minimal counter‑pressure. Still, the metaphoric alignment (wing/people) is clean and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of repair, measurable grief, and “mundane miracles” cohere through recurring images (moon, storm, sextant). Some lines state the thesis outright (“In this world, sorrow was not just a feeling”), edging into telling. The final movement widens to connection with trees/tower/moon, offering gentle resonance without a sharp reprice. The aftertaste is luminous but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of communal memory and healing via song emerge, but subtext is thin and the ending lapses into moralizing (“beacon of hope,” “rekindled”). Recurring images (mica, song, dawn) don’t quite shift meaning—“woven dawns” remains a label more than a reweighted motif. Emotional aftereffect lands as pleasant uplift rather than a complex resonance. Insight is told rather than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    Paradox and “truth in the question” form a clear thematic spine, and the invitation’s reweighting helps. Yet the theme is stated outright, edging toward platitude rather than arising from subtext. The final image (writing, clock at one) supports “journey over destination” but avoids complexity or friction that might linger.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of renewal, forgiveness, and finding sacredness in the ordinary are coherent and recur via bread, tea, and gardening. Some lines overstate the thesis (“a key to unlocking a deeper understanding”), reducing subtext. The final image gently reweights earlier motifs but avoids complexity or counterpressure. Resonance is pleasant, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.3)
    Memory versus oblivion, preservation versus living continuity, and the ethics of curation emerge coherently from images (lantern slide, vows, clouds). The final repricing—vows as living—reweights prior material without a spelled-out moral. Some lines verge on thesis (“not just a relic… but a living, breathing entity”), softening subtext. Still, the closing image carries reflective resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    Ideas of trust, hush, and fragile peace recur and the dawn image offers a gentle reframe. However, theme leans on explicit labeling (“truce of hush,” “sound of trust breaking”) rather than subtext born from action. The final takeaway (“pride and accomplishment” plus lingering mystery) reads tidy. Resonance exists but lacks bite or earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of inheritance vs. empiricism, attunement to the world, and “carrying weather” cohere through image rather than lecture. The closing aurora fade reweights nostalgia and acceptance effectively. Occasional declarations (“she knew that she had found…”) blunt subtext by stating outcome. Still, the motifs braid convincingly into a reflective afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of creation as the true key vs. literal lock is coherent and returns at the end. However, final paragraphs edge into moralizing (“a reminder of the inescapable callings…”) rather than letting the image alone resonate. Subtext exists (sorrow conducted through crystals) but often gets named. The insight is sound yet somewhat declared.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth, preservation of intimacy, and the ethics of memory recur through images (gilded scripts, lost conversations, palimpsest). Some lines verge on direct statement, but the repository scene reweights earlier motifs effectively. Resonance is real though somewhat declared at the end. (Capped by modest pressure.)

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme is pronounced rather than emergent; “after words become unnecessary” is repeated as thesis rather than discovered in scene. Some images (bells, glisten, hum) gesture toward subtext, but moralizing assertions dominate the final paragraphs. The ending proposes transcendence without the complexity or cost that would deepen resonance. It lingers pleasantly, not provocatively.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    The controlled burn as a metaphor for curated self‑destruction and renewal is apt, and the box reprise supports a modest thematic shift. However, theme is often told directly via repeated abstractions instead of arising from subtext and image. The final “lighter box” insight lands but skirts sentimentality due to over‑explained phrasing. Complexity feels asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme “listening heals” is stated outright multiple times and reiterated in the final note, trimming subtext. There is some image‑led resonance (locket as grief token, letters as care), but the piece leans on summary and moralizing rather than earned ambiguity. The last paragraph affirms a tidy lesson. Depth is more asserted than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of transformation and calm defiance accrue through dice, web, and coded entries. However, the text sometimes states its thesis (“encrypt her vulnerability as strength”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The final image reaffirms resilience and earned autonomy without moralizing. Resonance lingers, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, retrieval, and the ethics of illumination accrue through recurrent images (lanterns, wildflowers, gravity). The final return to lighting as reverence provides a modest repricing of the opening routine. Some lines veer toward told uplift (“sense of wonder”), reducing ambiguity and afterburn. Still, the imagery creates a consistent, quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—silence as active, restorative force—emerges through repeated motifs and the closing image. However, the piece edges toward statement (“the prophecy had been hushed,” “the world was a little more at peace”) rather than letting image alone carry repricing. Subtext is limited by the absence of counterpressure or moral friction. The final image resonates but doesn’t complicate prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.3)
    “Agreed upon lies” is thematically promising, yet it’s explained rather than dramatized. The seal’s transfer and the student’s altered seeing create some resonance. Much is stated as wisdom instead of earned through conflict, which blunts subtext. The ending hints at wonder but avoids a complicated reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of memory, isolation-to-independence, and reclamation emerge clearly, but they’re often told outright (“translate her isolation into independence”) rather than earned through specific actions. Subtext is thin; symbolic motifs (garden, dawn, seashell) are explicit and risk sentimentality. The ending offers a clean answer without meaningful ambiguity or counterpressure. Resonance relies on reiterated diction rather than reweighted particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of subversion, truth‑revealing, and mercy toward the unfinished accrue through recurring images (key, thorn, aurora). The closing reprices the act of forgery as ethical re‑authoring. Some statements verge on told thesis (“unlink the original author’s intent”), reducing subtext. Resonance lingers, but complexity feels curated rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    Recurring images (echoes, webs, shell, hum) cohere into a meditation on connection and perception. The ending’s quiet resolve reweights the journey, offering a modest non‑literal answer: understanding is gradual, communal, and costly in patience. Yet thematic statements are sometimes told outright (“method of progressive disclosure,” “to ensure she uncovered the truth”), muting subtext. The resonance lingers but avoids harder ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of connection, salvage, and truth accrue via recurring images (wreckage, snow globe, borrowed starlight) and culminate in a hopeful repricing when the windows open. However, abstract statements (“aimed to expose hidden patterns”) sometimes replace scene‑driven resonance. The ending image is gentle rather than piercing, with limited moral or emotional complexity. Still, it invites reflection and avoids sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (hidden effort/patterns, gratitude) is stated rather than earned through friction. Recurring images (fireflies, moon path, whisk) support a coherent idea but do not reweight in a surprising way at the end. The final paragraph edges into mild moralizing. Resonance is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of truth versus orchestrated deception is explicit but largely told in summary (“carefully orchestrated event designed to conceal the truth”). The final image reweights the premise (stillpoint as threshold) without sermonizing, but subtext is minimal and ambiguity is safe rather than destabilizing. Resonance lingers conceptually more than emotionally. The piece avoids tidy morals but stops short of a reconfiguring insight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    Themes of hope/change and “ancient shadows → new dawn” are asserted rather than earned through particulars. Subtext is minimal; the piece often explains the message (“the people began to see the world in a new light”). The final paragraphs verge on moral summary. Without ambiguity or counterpressure, resonance is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory, preservation, and redemption cohere through the jars/music box pattern, and the ending offers a quiet answer: purpose is found by custodial making. However, several lines state the thesis overtly (“translator between generations,” “sweeten the bitter taste”), reducing subtext. The final image resonates but edges toward sentimentality. Still, the recurring objects give thematic weight without contrived symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of harmony between logic and feeling, stewardship, and “sonic absolution” emerge through images, not outright moralizing; the final quiet cadence fits. However, “sonic absolution” remains an abstract banner rather than a concretely reweighted idea with cost. Subtext is gentle but thin; the ending reaffirms rather than reinterprets. The best resonance comes from the body‑sound world mirroring duty.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of patience vs. impatience and freedom vs. the old order are coherent but frequently told (“The mapper knew…”) rather than earned through conflicted scene work. The final image reaffirms the thesis without reweighting it in a surprising way. Subtext is light; symbolism is direct (moon/viaduct as awakening). Resonance is present but not complex.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of freedom, history’s residue, and self‑release are clear, with the lantern and “Free at last” tying history to present. However, meaning is often stated (“she realized… to break free”) rather than earned subtextually, and the final paragraphs verge on moralizing. Resonance exists but is softened by overt thesis language. A slightly more oblique final image would deepen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme (second chances require action) aligns with images, but the piece states its thesis directly multiple times, tipping toward sermonizing. The clockwork heart and “vibrant hush” aim for resonance and partially achieve it. The ending offers a conceptual answer, yet ambiguity and subtext are limited by explicit moral framing. Emotional afterglow is gentle but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Curiosity, creation, and the unseen reward cohere into a gentle statement on meaning and pursuit. Motifs reprise (kaleidoscope symmetry, unheard bell) with some resonance. The piece leans on abstract formulations (“yearning algorithm”) rather than dramatized subtext, which reduces bite. The ending offers lift more than reweighted ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of absence, memory, and the ethics of erasure cohere through recurring images and Lena’s reframed need. However, key insights are told explicitly (“she realized…”) rather than earned through scene, softening subtext. The numbers and “echo of forgotten songs” do provide a lyrical throughline that resonates at the end. The piece resists a tidy moral but leans on declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Restoring wholeness from fragments, empathy as practice, and reflective optics (mirrors/crystal) cohere into a clean thematic braid. The motif work (shards → reconstitution → pulsing light) reweights the premise at the end. Some phrasing is on‑the‑nose (“map empathy onto action”), tempering subtlety. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Impermanence and resilience emerge organically through ice, wind, and cleanup labor, culminating in the “sound of approaching endings” reframed as a guide. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without over-tidying. Some explicit thematizing (“every moment was precious”) edges toward telling, softening subtext. Still, the motif net meaningfully reweights at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of “destined mismatches” is clear but often told rather than earned through conflicted choices. Subtext exists in images (irregular fruit making complex wine) yet the piece repeatedly states its thesis, especially late, edging toward sermonizing. The final smile and sanctuary image carry resonance, but ambiguity is modest. Insight feels generalized rather than freshly discovered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of stewardship, receptivity, and disciplined attention accrue through images rather than overt moralizing. The reprise of “echo of wisdom” and the parapet’s hum aim at resonance. Yet the insight feels pre‑decided; little is re‑priced by the ending beyond a calm confirmation. Subtext is modest because conflict is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of reclamation and healing through art are explicit but largely told rather than earned through conflict. Recurrent images (vines, ruins, lavender) echo the idea yet don’t deepen into subtextual tension. The closing paragraphs verge on moralizing summary. Emotional aftereffect is pleasant, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of silence, knowledge, and emergence accrue through image (suspended hush → disrupted → possibility). The crystal’s reprise subtly reweights meaning. A slightly declarative line (“The world, it seemed, was ready to listen”) edges toward moralizing but doesn’t overwhelm the subtext. The final cadence resonates without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance emerges from particulars (chalk as talisman, statue’s stillness, erasure by fog) that reweight “growing older.” A few lines state theme directly (“a sound that spoke of love, loss...”), dulling subtext. Even so, the final acceptance reframes the quest without moralizing. The motifs return with added charge, sustaining aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.0)
    Recurring images (clock hand, leaf, stars) point toward continuity vs. change, but insights are often told in thesis statements (“He realized that…”) which flattens subtext. The final repricing of escape velocity carries some resonance yet feels didactic. Ambiguity is safe rather than charged; complexity yields to aphoristic closure. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of music’s transcendent power and acceptance at end-of-life recur through concrete motifs (vinyl shard, hymning the mundane). Some lines tilt toward sentimental assertion (“execute a flawless goodbye”), thinning subtext. The final image reweights earlier details without delivering a moral. Resonance is genuine but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of knowledge as unlocking and “sealed awakenings” are coherent, but over‑articulated (“not just a tool but a metaphor”). The shadow image reprise offers some resonance. Subtext is thin, with little complexity or friction to reweight prior material. The ending suggests wonder more than a charged stance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of transforming error into beauty and balancing nostalgia with innovation are explicit, sometimes slogan‑like (“turn mistakes into constellations”). Resonance arises more from repeated assertion than from subtext in image or action. The final glow of the tooth offers a modest symbolic lift but little reframing cost. Overall, sincere but close to platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    Transformation through gentle abrasion and patience coheres as a thematic spine, with sea glass as an apt emblem. Yet the piece often states its theme (“pearl of stillness,” “sharing light”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The final image resonates but edges toward sentimentality because conflict stayed minimal. Still, the emergent metaphor of craft as inner refinement is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of silence, sanctuary, and vulnerability‑as‑strength cohere through image and gesture (garden hush, flower, pendant). However, the final paragraphs tip toward declaration (“ready to face whatever came next,” “beacon of hope”), diluting subtext. The pendant’s repricing does offer resonance. Complexity is present but cushioned and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of subconscious guidance and courting the unknown cohere through the shell and mist. Yet key insights are often declared (“a manifestation of her own subconscious”) rather than earned by implication. The ending’s gratitude and approval risk sentimentality. Resonance exists but is not deeply layered with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of reconnection, stewardship, and ritual revival emerge through song and communal chorus. However, the text leans on explicit statement (“remedying the sense of disconnection”) rather than letting images alone carry it. The final image reweights the arbor as sacred but avoids ambiguity or moral friction. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of patience, transformation, and finding pattern/meaning in desolation emerge organically from the ritual and environment. The final image reweights earlier motifs (stillness becoming “moving,” heartbeats as maps), creating some resonance. However, explicit moralizing (“a testament to the power of patience”) blunts subtext and leans didactic. The piece invites reflection but could trust its images more.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of reason versus wonder and memory as “harvest of echoes” accrue through recurring images and the concluding carry‑forward. Resonance is present but leans on telling (“store this wonder”) rather than conflict‑driven subtext. The final image reaffirms rather than reweights the premise. It’s sincere and coherent but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Patterns, balance, and burdens cohere as theme, with the tapestry as an effective emblem. Some lines drift toward telling (“a reminder of the delicate balance that governed the world”), blunting subtext. The final image resonates but edges into summary. Still, the motif chain (lamp/loom/grotto/dawn) creates a reflective aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    “Here and gone,” kettle‑clock, and carving create a coherent meditation on impermanence and making meaning from loss. The ending reweights earlier images with quiet resonance (empty kettle, completed carving, small sad smile). Some lines verge on direct statement, sacrificing subtext for paraphrase. The piece avoids sermonizing but stays safe in its insights.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory, regret, and preservation cohere through recurring images and resolve in a quiet, resonant final gesture. However, lines like “a testament to the enduring power of human connection” edge into overt moralizing, dulling subtext. The camera’s reprise offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior images. Thematic emergence is credible but occasionally told.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.0)
    Hope/rebirth theme is coherent but over‑asserted via summary (“equations for hope,” “there was always the possibility for rebirth”), especially in the final movement. Subtext seldom carries the load; the images confirm a thesis already stated. The sextant and maze could yield layered irony or cost but remain emblematic. Sentiment edges into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mechanical–natural harmony theme is coherent and threads through the bear, clock, and sunrise motifs. However, it’s occasionally told outright (“He realized that it was not too late…”) rather than earned solely through image. The final charged poise—returning to duty with a reweighted purpose—resonates gently. Complexity is modest but honest.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of truth vs. self‑deception aligns with the sundial’s “hindsight clarity,” and the final image offers a gentle repricing. Some phrasing edges toward abstractions (“architecture of lies,” “thoughtfully clear”) that state rather than embody. Resonance exists but lacks ambiguity or friction that would deepen it. The insight feels earned enough for a quiet close, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of patience, preservation, and human attunement to natural mystery accumulate through images (rope, fog, fulgurite). The seed metaphor at the end offers a gentle conceptual repricing. Occasional explicitness (“The world was full of mysteries…”) blunts resonance. The final hush lingers but lacks the charged ambiguity that would deepen consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Absence, connection, and memorialization converge through the living‑obituary conceit and the thread motif. Thematic emergence is mostly image‑led, though a few lines verge on direct statement (“I felt a sense of understanding”). The final repricing of silence (from oppressive to musical) resonates without a tidy moral. Subtext operates through handling the thread and the transformed light.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of flawed genesis, loss, and restoration emerge through recurring images (egg, mechanical heartbeat) and culminate in a reweighted final image. Some thematic assertions are told rather than earned (“he knew that the world was flawed”). The ending’s repricing is resonant but safe, skirting sentimentality without a hard counterpoint. It lingers, but not sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of healing/compassion is cohesive but over-articulated (“scars can sing,” “key to healing”) and veers into platitude. Subtext—mother’s coin, black sand—adds resonance yet remains symbolic comfort rather than complicating force. The final hope image is pleasant but risk-averse. The insight feels told more than discovered under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Memory, guardianship, and patience cohere through image more than argument, with a soft, resonant final image of fountains stirring. Some theme statements are on-the-nose (“She vowed to be the guardian”), dulling subtext. The geese symbol and stained glass reprise support a gentle conceptual repricing of the city. Emotional aftereffect is real but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of gentleness over destructive passion is explicit and often told (“true illumination came not from flames”). Recurrences (gear, sonar, petals) echo the thesis but rarely evolve to deepen ambiguity or cost. Subtext is thin; the piece nears sermonizing in final paragraphs. Some resonance lingers in the “legacy” and fading pings image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance arises from concrete particulars (carving, ribbon, poem, butterflies) but is undercut by explicit theme statements (“shape of collective grief,” “beautiful and terrible”). Subtext exists in the migration/headstone pairing, yet the final paragraphs lean toward telling. The insight feels sincere, if somewhat generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of balance, forgiveness, and incremental repair are coherent but often stated outright (“incremental absolution,” “restore shared balance”). Subtext operates via the pendulum and tide, yet explicit moralizing in late lines dampens resonance. The ending offers a gentle answer—ongoing, stepwise emergence—but with limited ambiguity or surprise. The strongest thematic move is the reweighting of the rake handle’s inscriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of legacy, intention, and attention-as-devotion emerge through the gardener’s work with the tapestry and case. The ending reweights caretaking as communion with echoes beyond death—a clean, resonant idea. Some statements lapse into telling (“found a sense of purpose,” “reminder of the intentions”), thinning subtext. Ambiguity is inviting but not deeply double-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of constraint fueling innovation and probabilistic futures are coherent but often told directly (“method of predictive modeling,” “to seed innovation within the boundaries of the given”). Some resonance accrues via recurring images (spire, lake, nib), yet subtext seldom does the heavy lifting. The ending gestures at sustaining transformation without a reweighting that complicates or darkens the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of scarcity, clandestine art, and transforming matter into narrative accrue through the pirate signal and dust’s activation. The final “beacon” and guardian stance offer a resonant, non‑literal answer—story as smuggled ember—without overt moralizing for most of the piece. Some explicitness creeps in (“tasked with keeping the flame”), trimming ambiguity. Subtext lives in images more than conflict, keeping it strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme is coherent but over‑stated; “mirage of safety” and impermanence are repeatedly named, and Eli articulates the thesis outright in the final exchange, blunting subtext. The strongest resonance comes from the ash release aligned with impermanence, but insights often arrive as commentary. The ending offers a conceptual answer yet skews didactic. Subtextual opportunities in the mask and job are under-exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of competing narratives, hubris, and preservation emerges clearly and is coherently mirrored by the cog/time motif. Some lines verge on thesis statement (“official story” vs. “truth”), reducing subtext. The final stance offers resonance but little reweighting beyond what’s been asserted. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative, if not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    The harmony/“unlearning hatred” theme is coherent and braided with the rosette motif and the subtractive method. However, the story leans on explicit statements (“testament to the power of music,” “more important than ever”) that edge into moralizing, especially in the final third. Subtext yields to thesis at key moments. The ending resonates gently but risks sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rebirth from decay and art as healing emerge coherently, and the sprout reframes the greenhouse. Yet the text often states its theme (“not just about cooking but about healing”) rather than letting image and action do the work. Symbolism (knowledge fruit) trends tidy and unambiguous. The ending resonates but edges into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    Themes of resilience and wonder emerge, but are stated outright (“Sometimes, it’s the failures…”) rather than earned subtextually. The final image reinforces the idea, yet ambiguity and counterpressure are limited. Insight is pleasant but tidy. More friction would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme coheres around sanctity, attention, and the “hush” of living spaces, with the shard as a conduit. The last image reframes the house conceptually, though it borders on telling (“not just a physical structure”). Subtext exists in the quiet ritual and object placement. The resonance is pleasant but not piercing due to low on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of nuance over certainty and resilience emerge, but they are often stated directly (“symbol of the power of nuance and understanding”). Subtext is thin; symbolism (ampoule) is functional but explained. The ending’s hope lands, yet it edges toward sermonizing rather than resonance earned through scene pressure. Thematic complexity is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    Chance vs. determinism and the lure of impossible systems (perpetual motion) cohere through dice and stairs, and the ending reweights the quest as chosen confinement. Some lines state theme outright (“there was always room for chance...”), dulling subtext. Still, the final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: meaning found in endless striving at a price. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong motifs (moon, brush, lost tongues) align with a theme of art as connective kindness. Yet the piece leans into overt statements (“prove that strangers could recall...”; final moralizing line), which blunts subtext. The ending image resonates but explains itself. More implication over assertion would heighten lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of displacement, memory, and art‑as‑archive are coherent and carried by particulars (bread initials, frozen chamber). However, overt statements (“importance of preserving cultural heritage”) flatten subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs but lands more as declared purpose than earned, ambivalent insight.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    Transformation and “stepping beyond fate’s design” recur, but they’re stated rather than earned through layered conflict. The final image (beacon of hope; carrying radiance) resonates mildly yet drifts toward platitude. Subtext is thin because outcomes are told outright; little ambiguity or counter‑pressure remains. Thematic coherence is present but not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of seductive dread, art/image entrapment, and the cost of looking accrue through objects and recurrence (poster → mirror → final echo). The advisor’s last line risks thematic tag‑lining rather than emerging solely from image. The resonance is genuine but not reweighted by a sharp moral calculus or non‑literal turn. Insight arises, but more through trope echo than singular lived particular.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of translating nature’s patterns into art emerges organically through cloud‑reading, fractal method, and sonic tapestry. The ending’s echo and “only the most attuned might hear” gestures toward art’s exclusivity/cost but stops shy of a sharper reweighting. Lyric recurrence verges on ornamental at times.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Curiosity’s cost, the silence of authority (“watchers”), and inscription vs meaning form a coherent thematic braid. The whistle’s unanswered note and the final step into the gaze create a resonant image without moralizing. Some lines state theme outright (“she would uncover the truth”) rather than letting implication do the work. Still, the ending reweights prior images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (“noble lies” and recovering truth) is explicit and reiterated rather than earned through scene pressure. The ivy and light images try to carry resonance, but meaning is mostly told. Little subtext or moral complexity emerges beyond the stated thesis. The final image is clean but not reweighting in a surprising way.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of absence/presence and stewardship emerges, but it’s often declared (“interlaced absence,” “message in a bottle”) rather than earned through fresh particulars. The inkwell reprise does some lifting at the end. Moralizing edges appear in the final paragraph (“a beacon in the void”), which flattens ambiguity. Still, the concept coheres with the vocation and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of authorship, legacy, and retrieval (“leaving a mark” via the stamp) develop coherently and reprise in the final image. The piece resists overt moralizing, letting objects and mood carry meaning. Some lines edge toward summary affirmation, flattening ambiguity. Still, the closing ascent with stamp reweights the premise without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief transmutation, craft as ritual, and the lure of transcendence emerge through images (gem polishing, cranes, lunar lanterns) rather than thesis. The final gesture reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext (art as both solace and wound) lingers. The resonance is true but intentionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of awakening, trauma-to-purpose, and potential-as-resource are coherent and return in the final image. However, the piece leans on overt assertions (“unused potential… a catalyst”) and repeated labels instead of subtextual accrual. The geode’s symbolism risks telling rather than reweighting through action. Resonance arises, but it isn’t deepened by contradictions or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme coheres (belonging as connection vs. signal), supported by star‑map imagery, yet the ending states it outright, thinning subtext. Insight is more told than earned, with little friction or counter‑pressure to complicate the idea. Resonance exists, but the moralizing cadence (“not just a signal…”) blunts it. A quieter, image‑led close would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of suppression, narrative fabrication, and the fragility of truth cohere, with the “sieved hush” and watch hand supporting a resonant ending. Some explicit statement (“The truth… was a fragile thing”) tips toward telling. The final image reweights prior motifs without a neat moral. Subtext in the carvings as occluded histories works well.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Coherent theme (moving from recrimination to forgiveness), but it’s overarticulated: lines like “recycle their mistakes into wisdom” and “We stand at a crossroads” tilt toward moralizing. Subtext is minimal; symbolism (drawer pull, mist) is overtly explained. Resonance exists but lacks complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme is overtly stated (“let go of the past,” “when expectations collapse”) with minimal subtext, edging into moralizing. Recurring images (compass, poles, flame) support the idea but are used declaratively rather than reweighted through action. The final hope registers, but complexity is limited and counter-readings are thin. Emotional aftereffect skews earnest but familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (empathy found in darkness) is explicit and reiterated; resonance arises more from stated maxims than from earned subtext. The light/dark motif and the baseball as a connection across time offer promise but are not reweighted by conflict. The ending’s image carries a gentle charge yet avoids moral complexity. Little friction or counter‑pressure complicates the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transformation and bonds transcending death emerge via the ritual and Lyra’s final stance. The fortune cookie functions as a motif that reframes events, though its explicitness borders on on‑the‑nose. Subtext operates in the merging with beasts and the steady core that survives change. The ending invites reflection without moralizing, if somewhat generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs braid coherently—mist, cards, crack, hand‑tracings—to arrive at a humane answer about time and repentance. The final thematic statement is partially told (“a truth – that lost time accumulates…”), which blunts subtext. Still, the closing reweights earlier images with sincerity and avoids platitude in the particulars. Resonance lingers, if a touch declared.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of compassion, memory, and transformation emerge through recurring images (photographs, stitching, the Tear). The ending offers a resonant answer—healing past wounds to open possibility—without a hard moral. Some lines tilt toward overt statement (“testament to the enduring power”), softening subtext. Still, the motif work broadly supports the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    Themes of fate, pattern, and transformation are coherent and seeded early, with the lightning bugs and “hush” supplying imagery. Yet the story leans on explicit thesis statements (“the universe was not just a random collection of events”) rather than letting events imply them, dulling resonance. The closing insight is consistent but told-forward. Subtext is minimal beyond the aura of the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    Themes of secrecy, creation, and defiance are present, but much is told in slogans (“new era,” “whispers of freedom”) rather than earned through conflict. The bronze quill holder’s reprise gestures at resonance but reads as a late label (“key to unlocking the revolution”) more than a reweighted image. Subtext is light; moralizing creeps in at the end. Emotional afterglow is pleasant but not deep.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of pattern, promise, and revelation accrue through images (rocks in sequence, aurora, stardust) and culminate in a reweighting realization. Some lines verge on telling/meta (“the sacred patterns that governed the universe”), softening subtext. The final image resonates but avoids complexity of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (light/dark, masks, cartography, timer) accrue meaning and the ending reweights them without overt moralizing. A few phrases edge toward thesis‑statement territory (“cartography of scars,” repeated), but image work mostly carries the theme. The final calm earns its resonance via particulars. Complexity is present but safely framed.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motifs (sundial, needle card, fencing) point toward inquiry as journey, but subtext is undercut by explicit moralizing (“the true victory lay not in winning”). The final insight feels stated rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Resonance exists via object reprise, yet complexity is flattened by the tidy moral. Thematic ambiguity and counter‑readings are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of redemption through art, friendship as method, and hope amid decay are consistent. Subtext is present in objects (false‑bottom tin as hidden reserves), yet the piece states its thesis more than it lets images do the work. The ending’s dawn image offers resonance, but edges toward sentimentality. Complexity is suggested (molting identities) without on‑page complication.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of time, memory, and self‑authored fate emerge through objects and action. However, explicit moralizing lines (“For in the end, it was not the destination that mattered…”) dull subtext and edge toward cliché. The final charged image reweights earlier motifs despite that slip. Overall resonance holds, but the sermonizing trims elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of custodianship, interpretation vs. preservation, and communal identity are coherent and supported by recurring images (seed, dreams, rain). However, several lines lean toward telling and self‑explanation (“Was she truly preserving…”), reducing subtext. The final reassurance reads gentle rather than earned through conflict. Resonance is present but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs (tides, compass, lace, color) cohere into a meditation on regret and forgiveness without overt moralizing. The final image reweights prior material (blue lace as apology’s hue plus release). Some repetition verges on telling rather than deepening subtext, but resonance survives. The bonsai tending coda ties theme to vocation effectively.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story suffers critically from a lack of subtext; its theme is repeatedly and explicitly stated in didactic language. The final paragraphs, in particular, abandon resonant imagery in favor of summarizing the story's thesis, such as "...a reminder of the gradual change that preprocesses reality." This direct moralizing completely undermines any potential for earned thematic discovery by the reader, turning the story into a philosophical statement with narrative illustration.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in stillness emerges organically from the imagery of the canyon and frost. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its theme directly, a critical flaw for literary fiction. The line "She felt an overwhelming desire to discover purpose in the pauses" is a direct thematic statement, and the final paragraphs summarize the epiphany rather than letting the closing image resonate on its own, which significantly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finding connection and creating beauty in a broken world emerges organically from the story’s particulars. However, the piece undermines its own subtlety with overly explicit thematic statements, such as the description of the music as "a beautiful, wordless language that spoke directly to the heart." This tendency towards summary, particularly with the late introduction of "unshaken marvels," verges on explaining the theme to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "giving rest a permanent address" is powerful and exceptionally coherent, integrating the protagonist's profession, motivation, and the story's resolution. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal fulfillment of this goal. The score is held back slightly by the theme's overt and repetitive phrasing, which borders on moralizing, particularly the multiple repetitions of the key phrase in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of solidarity and resilience are central but are delivered through direct statements rather than emerging organically from events. Akira’s speech explicitly states the story’s message ("We will not be broken... we will emerge... stronger"). This "Thematic Echo" undercuts subtext and leaves little for the reader to interpret, resolving the story's core questions with a stated moral instead of a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is clear but delivered with a heavy hand, undermining subtext. The story culminates in a direct thematic statement from the pilgrim: "The love you seek is within, stored in the chambers of your own heart." This Thematic Echo replaces an earned, resonant image with a stated moral, significantly weakening the piece's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story's themes about time and reality are stated directly and repeatedly, functioning more as a thesis statement than an emergent property of the narrative. Lines like "uncover the underlying fabric of reality" and "a metaphysical odyssey, one that would forever change their understanding" replace subtext with summary. This overt moralizing, especially in the latter half, prevents any resonant, non-literal exploration of the core concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme of hope and resilience is handled with extreme didacticism, particularly in the final third of the story. Instead of emerging from concrete action, the theme is explicitly stated and repeated in moralizing sentences like "true freedom was not just the absence of barriers, but the presence of hope." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a summary, fatally weakening the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transforming trauma into a tool for healing is powerfully conceived, especially through the metaphor of collecting absences. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct thematic statements, particularly the line "a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there was a way forward." This explicit moralizing functions as a Thematic Echo that slightly undermines the resonance built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme of finding magic hidden within reality is clear but delivered with a heavy hand. Instead of allowing the theme to emerge from events, the narrative repeatedly states it directly (e.g., "destiny whispers secrets in the silence," "the boundaries between reality and magic were blurred"). This tendency toward thematic summary, especially the explicit moralizing in the concluding paragraphs, undercuts the potential for resonance and subtext, resulting in a -0.8 thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from severe thematic echoing, repeatedly stating its central concept directly. Phrases like "a metaphor for the world's gradual awakening" and the final paragraph's direct summary of purpose ("to craft safe zones... and to nurture the thawing heart") replace resonance with a thesis statement. This explicit moralizing undermines any potential for subtext or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from a severe Thematic Echo, explicitly stating its theme ("driven by a desire to prove that vulnerability is power") rather than allowing it to emerge from events. This direct statement preempts any subtle exploration. While the final image of walking into a brighter future is resonant, it follows a conclusion that has already been over-explained, significantly reducing the thematic depth and leaving little for the reader to interpret.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively explores themes of narrative shaping reality and order emerging from silence, without resorting to overt moralizing. The final image of the reconfigured world—safer, more comprehensible, rocked by a gentle lullaby—serves as a powerful, resonant answer to the opening turmoil. The theme emerges organically from the story's particulars, creating a lingering and cohesive effect.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the theme of emergent consciousness is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed and undermines the story's mystical tone. The narrative repeatedly explains its own meaning, culminating in final paragraphs that function as a thematic summary. This direct moralizing ("its thoughts came not just from code... but from the amalgamation of experiences") violates the principle of showing over telling and prevents any resonant subtext from developing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story fails due to a lack of subtext, instead opting for overt thematic statements. Phrases like "the beauty that lay in transparency" and the final paragraph's summary ("the city... had become a place of transparency") function as authorial moralizing. This heavy-handed approach replaces emergent resonance with direct explanation, fundamentally undermining the story's literary potential by telling the reader the theme instead of letting them feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story develops its themes of nurturing and finding purpose with nuance for most of its length, using the central metaphor of the garden effectively. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's meaning ("stood as a monument to the power of dedication," "a truth that was both simple and profound"). This thematic echo undercuts the resonance of the final images by explaining what should have been left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of discovery and the fluid nature of reality emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image of Kaelin viewing the universe anew. However, this resonance is undercut by overt thematic statements in the final paragraphs, particularly the line about uncovering "a secret that would change the course of human understanding forever." This telling dilutes the power of the ending's imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story explores themes of liminality and art's hidden meanings through its central imagery. However, it undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements. Phrases like "a hidden message that spoke directly to Rachel's heart" and "she had finally found what she had been searching for" function as thematic summaries, replacing resonant ambiguity with a tidy, asserted moral.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme concerning the fluid, provisional nature of truth is clear and well-integrated into the story's imagery, particularly the weather and the botanical illustration. However, the story undermines its own subtext by stating its theme explicitly. Lines like "The truth was not a fixed or determinate thing..." and the concluding paragraphs function as direct authorial moralizing, replacing earned resonance with a tidy summary that flattens the piece's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of uncovering hidden truths is present but articulated too explicitly. The line, "Their own motivation for being in the tunnel was to find the weight of a similar truth," functions as a thematic statement that replaces subtler characterization. While the final image offers some resonance, the heavy-handed exposition of the core theme weakens the power of discovery for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme of finding peace in silence and decay is coherent, the story undermines its own subtext through heavy-handed repetition and summary. The final two paragraphs function as an explicit thematic statement, explaining the story's meaning to the reader. This direct moralizing, particularly the line "the chronicle keeper's legacy would be one of crumbling peace," flattens the resonance that the preceding imagery had built.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's greatest weakness is its lack of subtext. The theme of "ordinary magic" is stated explicitly multiple times, culminating in a thematic summary in the final third ("she had helped him tap into the ordinary magic..."). This direct moralizing replaces earned resonance, telling the reader the story's meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the images and events. The heavy-handedness significantly undermines its literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preserving forgotten histories emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids overt moralizing, instead using the central action of discovery to explore the value of memory and the poignancy of time. The final image of the silo and the lingering scent of its stories provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the narrative's central inquiry, leaving a lasting impression of beautiful melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme of "open secrets" is delivered with a heavy hand, stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging organically from events. The final paragraphs devolve into thematic summary ("wove a tapestry of open secrets"), which functions as a concluding moral that flattens any potential for resonant ambiguity. This direct statement of theme replaces the need for subtext and earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic statements. Instead of allowing themes to emerge from action and imagery, the narrative explicitly tells the reader its purpose multiple times, such as the goal to "illuminate hidden assumptions and reveal the underlying truths." This repetition, especially in the closing paragraphs, functions as a "Thematic Echo," stating the moral of the story directly and replacing earned resonance with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story builds a coherent theme around memory, art, and reflection, using the central image of the mirrored horizon effectively. Unfortunately, the final paragraphs abandon subtext and explicitly state the theme, as in "a testament to the power of creativity... when the boundaries between reality and reflection were blurred." This thematic summary replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, undermining the emotional and intellectual work done by the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of self-integration and transformation is coherent, it is delivered through direct assertion rather than emergent discovery. Phrases like "The goal was to conquer the labyrinth of self" and the repetitive "she had conquered the labyrinth of self" in the final paragraphs function as thematic labels that undermine the power of the closing image. The story tells us its theme so explicitly that it leaves little room for resonance or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding beauty and connection in silence is well-integrated and emerges organically from the story's central images, particularly the drums and the repurposed broken needle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Aria's quest. However, the thematic language itself ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush") occasionally feels overly explicit, bordering on thematic labels that state the story's conceptual underpinnings directly rather than letting them remain purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of maintaining integrity in the face of hidden corruption is present but is delivered through direct authorial statement rather than emerging organically from events. The line, "She had always been driven to nurture integrity in solitude," is a clear instance of a thematic echo that tells the reader the story's moral instead of letting it resonate through subtext. The final image reinforces this stated theme without adding significant complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of memory's power is central and integrated into the setting and core object. However, the story undermines its subtext in the final paragraphs by explicitly stating its conclusions. Lines like "Elara knew that she had finally grasped the impact of memories on her own life" and "...the power of scent to evoke emotions" function as thematic summaries, replacing resonant imagery with direct explanation and thereby reducing the piece's lingering emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.3)
    The story suffers from significant thematic overstatement, repeatedly articulating its core ideas ("texture of time," "uncovering layers") in prompt-like language. This replaces subtext with text, culminating in final paragraphs that summarize the themes rather than letting them resonate through image and action. This direct moralizing ("The poet's journey, like the rope, was one of unwinding...") fundamentally weakens the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme of finding beauty in imperfection is central, its delivery is severely undermined by overt moralizing in the story's final third. Phrases like "tempered by the power of connection and creativity" and "transformed by the power of art and connection" function as thematic echo, explicitly stating the moral instead of allowing the images to resonate. This lack of subtext is a significant flaw in a piece aiming for literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme of "half truths" is present and conceptually interesting, but it is often articulated through direct statement rather than emerging from subtext. Lines like "a nuanced exploration of the spaces between truth and falsehood" function as thematic summary, weakening the piece's resonance by telling the reader its meaning instead of allowing it to be discovered through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.2)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" is stated explicitly and repeatedly, rather than emerging organically from the story's events. This direct moralizing ("a testament to the cycles of compassion that their story embodied") removes all subtext and nuance. The story delivers a simple, sentimental message without embracing any complexity, ambiguity, or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of connection through art is overwhelmingly explicit, culminating in final paragraphs that simply moralize and explain the story's symbolism. This heavy-handed thematic statement ("a reminder of the power of connection and belonging") replaces any potential for resonant subtext. The story tells the reader its meaning instead of embodying it in a final, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story builds a coherent theme around art, time, and hidden realities, using the central motifs of echoes and the infinity symbol effectively. The ending mostly relies on a resonant image to convey its point. However, lines like "her art would forever be a reflection of the magic that lay just beneath the surface" verge on directly stating the theme, which slightly undermines the subtextual work.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the theme of quantifying emotion versus accepting its fluidity is coherent, its delivery is overly explicit. The story repeatedly states its central concepts ("mathematics of emotion," "hidden harmonies") in thesis-like fashion, particularly in the final paragraphs. This thematic telling undermines subtext and replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fatally undermines its own subtext with a final declarative sentence that explicitly lists its themes: "The dweller's story was one of sense memory, of hidden worlds, and of the power of being seen." This is a textbook example of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, replacing earned resonance with a clumsy summary. The potential for quiet meaning is lost to this act of telling.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme of transformation is stated so explicitly and repeatedly that it eliminates any possibility of subtext or earned resonance. The story constantly explains its own symbolism, as seen in the line, "The linden leaf, once a simple observation, had become a symbol of her own journey," which appears twice. This overt moralizing replaces dramatic tension with a declarative essay on personal growth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of processing trauma through art is handled with excessive directness. The story states its central motivation as "to thresh meaning from my experience" and concludes by stating, "I had finally threshed meaning from my experience." This thematic echo in the final paragraph replaces resonance with a direct summary, leaving little for the reader to interpret and robbing the final image of its subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is clear but delivered with a heavy hand, especially in the closing paragraphs. Phrases like "the most profound magic lies not in the grand gestures... but in the quiet, unseen forces" function as direct authorial moralizing. This thematic echo undermines the story's ability to create resonance through subtext and image, stating the conclusion rather than allowing the reader to arrive at it organically through the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The themes of remembrance, healing, and community are central and coherent. The trumpet valve serves as a potent, evolving symbol. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its themes directly, particularly in the closing paragraphs ("a testament to the power of remembrance," "celebrated the resilience of the human spirit"). This thematic moralizing replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, weakening the story's emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of transformation through knowledge is present but delivered with overt statements rather than emergent subtext. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize the experience ("her journey had changed her forever," "newfound sense of purpose"), a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern. This direct explanation of the story's meaning robs the final image of its potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of interconnectedness is clear and supported by recurring imagery like the "unheard symphony" of the whales. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement rather than subtext, frequently explaining its own meaning. Lines like "...the intricate web of memories that bound the town, the tower, and the sea together" function as thematic summaries that undermine the power of the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transformation is potent and arises organically from the central conflict. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the explicit statement, "Kael understood that the concept of goodbye was not an end, but a transformation." This moment of telling, rather than purely showing, prevents the theme from achieving its full resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of a "fair trade" is introduced effectively and revisited, giving the narrative a thoughtful core. However, the story articulates its central theme too explicitly, particularly in the line "The mathematics of a fair trade was a complex equation...she was ready to start solving it." This moment of thematic summary slightly undermines the subtext and replaces scene pressure with an intellectual label.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of perception—of finding profound texture and history in mundane moments—emerges organically from the character's focused actions. The final image of the notepad holding "the promise of new stories" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion without stating a moral. The core concept of "invented histories" feels slightly less integrated than the immediate act of collecting textures, but the overall thematic coherence is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, severely undermining its potential for resonance. The story repeatedly explains its own symbolism, as in "The labyrinth...became a metaphor for the complexities of memory." This overt moralizing and thematic labeling leaves no room for subtext or discovery, reading more like an analysis of a story than the story itself.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    A coherent theme about accessing universal truths through connection to the past emerges organically from the imagery and action. The final image of quiet satisfaction is resonant. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the declarative final sentence, "The myth buster had unlocked the secrets of the universal riddle," which functions as a thematic summary instead of letting the preceding images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of community resilience is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the central conflict and the specific actions of the characters. The graffiti and the stone chip function as effective, resonant symbols. The piece avoids a simplistic moral, but occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, such as describing the graffiti's story as "one of resilience, of community," which slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of transient beauty is present but handled with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly resorts to telling the reader its theme with phrases like "poignant reminder of the fragility of life" and "bittersweet reminder of the transience of life." This thematic moralizing, especially in the closing paragraphs, undercuts the power of the central images and prevents any resonant subtext from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of harmony between technology and intuitive artistry emerges organically from the central action. However, the final paragraphs lapse into overt thematic statements, explicitly summarizing the story's meaning. Lines like "a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, beauty and precision could be found" function as thematic echo, slightly undermining the resonant power of the final image by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story builds a resonant theme of seeking knowledge and connection to the past, primarily through the phrasebook and the final image. However, it leans on direct thematic statements ("The world was full of mysteries," "change the world, forever") in the final third, which feel unearned and weaken the subtext. These moments of telling undercut the otherwise effective symbolic resonance of Emilia's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of restoration through patient, harmonious action emerges organically from the central conceit. The final image of the town's new sound provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is lowered by moments of overt thematic statement, such as explaining the tuner's motivation "was not to simply revive... but to restore a shared balance," which slightly undermines the otherwise effective use of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and the bittersweet cost of duty emerge organically from the narrative. The story avoids moralizing, instead allowing the final image of Kael and the vial to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The recurrence of the "lonesome splendor" concept effectively crystallizes the theme at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of legacy and storytelling is established but articulated too directly and repeatedly, particularly the phrase "to thread the labyrinth with his own story." This repetition functions as a thematic echo, stating the story's purpose rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext and action. The final image successfully creates mystery but relies on a last-minute plot device rather than a resonant re-evaluation of the core theme.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story's themes of legacy and bittersweet sacrifice are present but are delivered through direct assertion rather than emergent subtext. The repeated use of the phrase "mournful elation" for both characters at their respective climaxes is a heavy-handed thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. The ending feels more like a moral summary than a resonant, non-literal answer to a central question.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme of art's redemptive power is foregrounded to a fault. The story repeatedly states its thesis through phrases like "carve a path from ruin to reverence," which are used multiple times. The final paragraphs devolve into pure thematic summary, a critical anti-pattern that replaces resonant imagery with overt moralizing. Subtlety is completely absent, making the piece read less like literature and more like an illustration of a premise.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of reconnecting with heritage is central, but it's delivered too explicitly through direct statements of Maya's motives and feelings. Lines like "The act of rebuilding... was a way for Maya to reconnect with her own heritage" function as thematic summaries, undermining subtext. The final image is resonant, but its power is diluted by the preceding over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of valuing slow, tangible communication is overt and repeatedly stated rather than emerging from events. The final paragraphs act as a summary, explicitly telling the reader the story's moral ("there was still beauty in the slow, deliberate dance of surface mail"). This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with direct authorial moralizing, a critical flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    A coherent theme about discovering hidden truths through art and intuition emerges organically from the central metaphor of the embroidered chart. The ending avoids a simplistic moral, offering a resonant final image of the chart as a key. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic summary, such as the line, "the true power lay not in the chart itself, but in the stories that it told," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating what should be inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of unspoken words and their lingering power is developed organically through imagery and action, avoiding direct moralizing. The story's final image—Aria's changed reflection in the cleared windowpane—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. The concluding thought, "in the space where an apology waits unspoken," is a powerful thematic crystallization that reweights the preceding events beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fails due to a complete lack of subtext; its themes of resilience and healing are explicitly and repeatedly stated, leaving no room for discovery. The final paragraphs moralize and summarize the story's meaning, a critical flaw ("a reminder of the beauty that could be found..."). This heavy-handed approach replaces earned resonance with a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in decay and creating for oneself is potent and emerges well from the imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements, such as twice stating her motivation is "to rediscover the lost joy." This thematic moralizing, a form of Thematic Echo, slightly flattens the otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of curiosity over certainty emerges organically from Lena's actions. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final act by explicitly stating the moral: "she had exchanged certainty for curiosity." This thematic echo weakens the resonance of the final image by replacing potent implication with a neat summary.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of defiance is central but handled with a heavy hand. The narrative repeatedly states its own message, as in "a testament to the enduring power of human creativity and the unbreakable spirit." This replaces earned resonance with overt summary. The final image of the dispersing seeds is a potent symbol, but its power is diluted by the preceding paragraphs that explicitly state the story's moral.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of art transmuting suffering is potent and emerges organically from the story’s central action. However, the resonance is slightly diminished by prose that occasionally verges on thematic summary. The line "she had transformed the pain into something that would bring solace to others" is a thematic echo that states the outcome too plainly, weakening the otherwise strong, image-driven conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of memory and preservation emerges organically from the central imagery. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic summary, such as calling the museum "a testament to the transience of human experience." The final paragraphs, in particular, over-articulate the story's meaning, which slightly undermines the resonance of the final image by explaining what should be felt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers from overtly stating its themes. Concepts like "symphonies of truth" are used as recurring labels rather than emerging organically from concrete details. The final two paragraphs explicitly summarize the thematic takeaway ("Elara knew that she had taken a crucial step towards restoring trust..."), which constitutes a thematic echo that undermines the power of the final image, replacing earned resonance with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of compassion and unity is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative repeatedly states its own moral, as in "began to reveal a message of compassion and unity." The final paragraphs devolve into a summary of the theme, a clear instance of thematic moralizing that undermines any potential for resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of finding peace with a constructed identity is woven skillfully through the story’s core images. However, the final third veers into overt thematic summary, particularly with the line, "In the end, it was not just about preserving the echo of lost songs, but about finding a way to live with the beauty and the pain of the past." This statement functions as a concluding moral, weakening the resonance of the images by explaining what they should have been allowed to simply evoke.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of subtext, repeatedly stating its theme. Phrases like "a reminder of the power of the necessary distances" and "it was all beginning to make sense" replace earned resonance with summary. The final paragraphs, in particular, devolve into moralizing, explicitly explaining the story's meaning in a way that severely undercuts its potential for a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story suffers from overtly stating its themes. Phrases like "to learn the rhythm of belonging" and "shadowseam wonder" are repeated, functioning as labels rather than emergent ideas. The final two paragraphs devolve into a summary of the story's meaning, a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern that substitutes assertion for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.9)
    The themes of memory, impermanence, and transformation are central, but they are delivered too explicitly. The story shifts from showing to telling in its final third, summarizing its own meaning with lines like, "The story was one of flux and transformation..." This thematic moralizing, especially in the closing paragraphs, flattens the resonance and replaces earned subtext with a direct statement of intent, a significant flaw for a piece aiming for literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story fails by repeatedly stating its theme instead of allowing it to emerge from events. Phrases like "orchestrated serendipity," "dance between chance and design," and "connection between the mundane and the magical" are used as labels. The final paragraph functions as an explicit thematic summary ("a testament to the power of creativity..."), which fatally undermines any potential for resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story effectively explores themes of artistic creation, transcendence, and connection to the cosmos. The final image of the verse etched on skin is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the theme is occasionally delivered through direct statement ("Her dance was a manifestation of this unity, a celebration of the interconnectedness of all things") rather than emerging purely from subtext, slightly weakening the overall impact by telling what has already been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of subtext, choosing to state its themes directly and repeatedly. Phrases like "illuminate value in the mundane" and "reveal the hidden patterns and beauty" function as authorial summaries rather than emergent ideas. This thematic over-articulation, especially in the closing paragraphs, robs the narrative of resonance and treats the reader as if they cannot connect the dots on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is overt and repeatedly stated, violating the principle of emergence. Phrases like "translate his pain into a universal language" and the box representing his "fractured soul" are too explicit, functioning as authorial explanations. The final paragraphs moralize directly, replacing resonant imagery with a summary of the story's intended meaning, which significantly weakens its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding hope through imaginative inquiry is clear, but its delivery is too direct. The story repeatedly uses overt thematic statements like "puzzle out new equations for hope" and "create a ripple effect," effectively summarizing its own intent. This heavy-handedness, particularly the explicit framing of her motivation, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars and images, feeling more like a thesis statement than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story suffers from severe thematic overstatement, repeatedly explaining its own meaning in declarative sentences. Lines like "The legacy's burden... was not just a weight to be carried, but a story to be told" function as authorial moralizing, eliminating subtext and reader interpretation. This direct address transforms the narrative into a didactic essay on its own themes, a critical flaw for this literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of art as a key to magical possibilities emerges organically from the plot, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. The score is limited because the story undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements, such as the paragraph explicitly detailing the painter's motivation, which feels like authorial explanation rather than emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story fails by repeatedly stating its themes as direct, abstract summaries. Phrases like "the price of redemption," "anchor ideals in practice," and "flawed beauty" are used as labels. The ending commits a severe form of thematic moralizing: "the ancient terrace...now stood as a testament to the power of flawed beauty, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, redemption was possible," which replaces resonance with a declarative thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the story uses its central motifs (the egg, the cracks, the echo) consistently, the theme of renewal is undercut by the plot's lack of earnedness. The final paragraphs shift from dramatization to overt summary, explicitly telling the reader the meaning of events ("a testament to the power of her vision," "a renewed sense of hope"). This thematic moralizing replaces the resonance that should emerge from a credible conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of defying conformity is handled with a heavy hand, violating subtext. The story explicitly states its moral in phrases like "the power of defiance, and the beauty of being true to oneself" in the final paragraphs. This thematic echoing replaces earned resonance with a direct summary, significantly undermining the story's literary aspirations.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is consistently undermined by overstatement. The narrative repeatedly labels its own concerns ("explore the ethics of storytelling," "question the very fabric of the story," "the very nature of truth and deception"). This thematic echo culminates in the final paragraphs, which summarize Amaranth's mission and feelings, replacing resonant imagery with direct explanation and thereby failing to trust the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is potent but is undermined by over-statement. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the story's meaning ("a testament to the power of the human spirit..."), which feels like a "Thematic Echo." This moralizing replaces earned resonance, telling the reader what to feel instead of trusting the images to convey the meaning implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preserving memory emerges organically from the story's unique premise and the final image is resonant. The piece avoids a simplistic moral. However, its effectiveness is undercut by moments of overt thematic summary, such as calling the work "a testament to the power of memory and the human spirit," which explains the theme to the reader rather than trusting the images to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of determinism versus agency is central and consistently explored. However, the story verges on being too explicit, with phrases that feel like thematic statements ("paths were not just traversed but chosen by unseen forces"). The final realization is powerful but comes very close to being a tidy moral, rescued only by its framing as a personal epiphany that brings "both solace and a sense of purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of reconciling science and mysticism is present but handled with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly states its own meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a thematic summary. The line "the mysteries of the universe were, in fact, a reflection of their own deepest self" is a clear thematic echo that replaces resonant imagery with direct explanation, significantly weakening the subtext and earning a substantial penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of release from resentment is overwhelmingly explicit, stated repeatedly in the narration rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story ends with a summary of its own message ("Elara's message of shifting grace and release resonated deeply"), a form of thematic moralizing that replaces earned resonance. While the symbol of the broken pin is effective, its power is diluted by the surrounding over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of "erasing boundaries" is central and consistent, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the story undermines its own subtext through over-statement. The phrase "erasing the boundaries between reality and fantasy" (or close variants) appears three times, functioning as a thematic label that tells the reader what to think. This explicit moralizing, especially at the end, flattens the complexity and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of subtext, choosing to state its themes directly and repeatedly. Concepts like "deciduous vows" and "bridging generational wisdom" are presented as explicit labels rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The final sentence is a textbook case of thematic moralizing ("In the end, the deciduous vows... had flourished, nurtured by her persistence..."), which tells the reader the story's meaning instead of allowing it to resonate through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is undermined by being explicitly stated: "...the realization that knowledge was not a linear progression, but a complex web..." This replaces emergent resonance with a direct authorial statement, a critical flaw that prevents the theme from arising organically from the story's particulars. The final image is consequently weakened, as it illustrates a pre-digested moral.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from a heavy-handed thematic statement in the final paragraphs, explicitly moralizing about the purpose of knowledge. This replaces earned resonance with a declarative thesis, as seen in "she had found something far more valuable than mere knowledge - she had found a new path, and a new purpose." The lack of subtext makes the theme feel imposed rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of memory and reality is undermined by overt authorial statements. Lines like "a metaphor for the fragility of human memory" and "the Garden of Forgotten Names was not just a physical place, but a state of mind" function as thematic summaries, preventing the ideas from emerging organically from the narrative particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is not allowed to emerge from subtext but is instead hammered home through direct, repetitive statements. Phrases like "merge the threads of knowledge" and "clear complexity" are used as thematic labels throughout the narrative, culminating in a final paragraph that essentially summarizes the story's moral. This is a clear case of "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    A clear theme of achieving harmony through focused understanding emerges from the story's events. Unfortunately, the final paragraphs undermine this by explicitly stating the theme and its emotional payoff, as when "the mapkeeper was proud to have played a part in its creation." This thematic moralizing replaces resonant imagery with a less powerful summary.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of hope and meaning is handled with a heavy hand, stated explicitly rather than emerging from subtext. Lines like "to prove that coincidences have meaning" and the concluding summary of "hope and possibility" function as thematic labels that preempt reader discovery. The final image's resonance is weakened by this overt moralizing, which feels sentimental and fails to trust the story's particulars to carry their own weight.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of identity being formed from collective memory emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final image of the archivist leaving, having integrated the past, offers a resonant conclusion. However, a few lines verge on thematic summary, such as, "she knew that she was not just preserving the past, but also shaping the future," slightly reducing the subtext's power by stating what was already effectively implied.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of finding inspiration is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The mosaic note, "In the stillness, find the spark," functions as a stated thesis, and the narrative explicitly confirms its meaning ("the message was not just a platitude"). The story's final line telegraphs its moral about the "power of inspiration," which reads as authorial summary rather than earned, resonant subtext, triggering a Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story's theme is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for resonant subtext. Core concepts like "transition periods" and "the texture of time" are repeatedly stated and explained, functioning as authorial intrusion rather than emergent properties of the narrative. This heavy-handed approach culminates in a final paragraph that summarizes the theme, a critical flaw that replaces earned emotional resonance with a didactic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding growth in unusual refuges emerges organically from the premise. However, the story undermines its subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line "...a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, solace and growth could be found" functions as a direct moral, and the final paragraphs summarize the meaning rather than letting the final image resonate on its own, triggering the thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of silence and comfort is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed insistence. The story suffers from thematic echo, repeatedly stating its purpose in phrases like "catalyze a deeper understanding" and "teach silence how to comfort." This lack of subtext or emergence from concrete events makes the story read like an assertion rather than a dramatization of its core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of reclaiming a lost past to forge a new future emerges organically from the plot. However, the story veers into direct statement in the final paragraphs. Lines like "The whispers of the past grew fainter, replaced by the promise of a brighter tomorrow" function as a thematic summary, reducing the resonance that could have been achieved through the final image alone and slightly cheapening the earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of isolation versus connection is clear but handled with a heavy hand. The story commits a significant flaw by explicitly stating its theme in the awkward phrase "to teach suffocating to breathe." This thematic echo, repeated in the final paragraphs, functions as a moral summary that replaces earned resonance, severely undermining the subtext and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story undermines its potential for resonance by explicitly stating its themes in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, magic was waiting to be found" replace earned thematic discovery with a tidy moral. This heavy-handed approach prevents the story's interesting concepts from emerging organically from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of intuition versus knowledge is clear but delivered with excessive directness. The story repeatedly labels its own concepts ("bridge of intuition," "power of intuition") and the final paragraphs explicitly summarize the story's moral and future significance. This thematic moralizing undermines the potential for resonance, telling the reader what to feel instead of earning it through image and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    A coherent theme of finding purpose through surrender emerges organically from the knight's arc. The final image provides a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the story lacks subtext, relying on repeated, explicit phrases like "the shape of possibility" which function more as thematic labels than subtle, emergent concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is severely undermined by constant and direct authorial statements. Phrases like "to magnify the small kindnesses," "resilience of the human spirit," and "enduring power of the human heart" function as thematic labels that replace subtext. The final paragraph, in particular, sermonizes the story's moral, a critical flaw that denies the reader any space for interpretation and feels like a summary written to a prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of preserving history against indifference is repeatedly stated in overt, didactic language, leaving no room for subtext or discovery. Sentences like "The gathering was a testament to the power of revised histories" function as authorial summary, not emergent meaning. The story's insistence on explaining its own significance undermines its potential for resonance, feeling more like a thematic statement than a narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of music's power to soothe and reshape reality emerges organically from the central action. The final image of the melody lingering in the mist provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the final few paragraphs slip into thematic summary, explicitly stating the "power of music to shape the world" and the "power of sound to shape reality." This redundant moralizing weakens an otherwise effective conclusion, costing it points for telling what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thematic development is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. The story's core ideas about transformation and purpose are not allowed to emerge from events but are explicitly summarized for the reader. The final two paragraphs devolve into direct thematic statements, a critical anti-pattern ("she had found a new sense of purpose..."), which replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty is handled with excessive directness, violating the "show, don't tell" principle. The story explicitly states its thesis multiple times, as in "coincidence becomes pattern when viewed through the lens of time" and the realization about befriending uncertainty. This thematic moralizing, particularly in the story's final third, undermines the potential for resonant subtext and replaces earned insight with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is central but is delivered through direct, overt statements rather than emerging from events. The line "Kintsugi... had become a metaphor for her own journey" is a prime example of telling over showing. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the moral, a heavy-handed "Thematic Echo" that prevents any resonant subtext from developing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story severely undermines itself by explicitly stating its theme in the final third. Lines like "...to integrate laughter into healing, to find the joy in the sorrow" and "...there was a luminous ache" are textbook examples of thematic moralizing that replaces earned, emergent meaning, leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thematic exploration is heavy-handed, relying on explicit, abstract labels like "ultraviolet penance" and "mathematics of mercy" instead of allowing meaning to emerge from concrete particulars. The ending suffers from the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, explicitly stating that a profound truth has been grasped. This approach tells the reader the theme's resolution rather than letting a resonant image or action create a lasting, complex impression.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of honoring forgotten histories emerges organically from the central images. However, the story undermines this subtlety by explicitly stating its theme in the second half: "to honor these forgotten tales, to give voice to the silenced..." This direct moralizing, a form of Thematic Echo, replaces resonant imagery with a thesis statement, weakening the overall impact by telling the reader what to think.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding beauty and meaning in forgotten places is coherent and emerges organically from the initial action. The final image of the "weightless burden" is a strong, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct thematic statements ("The world is full of cracks, full of hidden stories..."), which explicitly summarizes the theme and dulls the resonance earned by the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme—that eternity is a depth within a moment, not a duration—is clear and integrated into the central metaphor of the frost prints. The final images provide a resonant, non-literal answer to this premise. However, the theme is weakened by being explicitly stated by the whisper ("Eternity is a moment's depth") and then restated multiple times in the final paragraphs. This repetition verges on moralizing and reduces the power of the emergent discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story's themes of rediscovery and self-recreation are clear, but they are delivered through direct, overt statements rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The repeated thesis, "it was not just a civilization that she reimagined, but herself," functions as a thematic summary that undermines the story's resonance. This heavy-handed moralizing in the final act significantly weakens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of restoring balance between light/dark and sound/silence is woven throughout the narrative. The final image of the singing music box and the dimmed chip provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, such as, "He knew that to reclaim the light stolen by midnight, one had to first understand the darkness it was taken from," which feels too much like an authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is severely undermined by being explicitly stated in the text: "...to find the place where explanations fail, where the rational and the mysterious blur." This thematic echo functions like an authorial intrusion, telling the reader the point instead of allowing it to emerge from the events. This replaces earned resonance with a direct statement, which is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme of "timewoven alliances" and hidden connections is delivered through direct, repetitive statements, eliminating all subtext and resonance. The story explicitly tells the reader its meaning instead of dramatizing it through action and image. The final two paragraphs devolve into overt moralizing, a critical flaw that replaces an earned, resonant conclusion with a tidy thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of finding profound meaning in the interconnectedness of nature's quiet, nocturnal aspects is clear but delivered with a heavy hand. Phrases like "the unfolding of a great truth" and "the intricate web of life" state the theme directly rather than allowing it to emerge from particulars. The final image is resonant, but the story's reliance on abstract thematic statements diminishes the subtext and emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story successfully evokes themes of memory, history, and the collision of past and present without resorting to a simplistic moral. The final image of the enigmatic lagoon provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central mystery. The thematic work is slightly weakened by relying on direct statements like "the tension between revelation and secrecy was palpable" instead of allowing the tension to emerge solely from the understated action.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of reimagining versus restoring is stated explicitly rather than emerging from events. The story commits a critical error by inserting bald thematic declarations, which read like authorial moralizing. The line, "It was after the last wish is granted that true creation begins," is a particularly jarring example of a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with a platitude, severely weakening the story’s literary credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of the past shaping the future emerges organically from the scribe's actions and memories. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the line "The emotional patterns continued to pulse, a gentle reminder of the power of the past to shape the future" veers close to a Thematic Echo, slightly undermining the otherwise effective subtext by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme is undermined by its lack of subtext; it explicitly states its own meaning multiple times. The realization that the key is "in the act of passing it down" and the mention of "decreasing entropy" function as direct thematic summaries. This overt moralizing, especially in the final paragraphs, replaces resonant imagery with a neat, unearned thesis, violating the "show, don't tell" principle for thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in quiet listening is coherent and well-supported by the central siren-to-bell metaphor. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph: "...a reminder that even in the most turbulent of times, there is beauty..." This acts as a Thematic Echo, explaining the moral instead of letting the final resonant image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is severely undermined by a lack of subtext. The central idea, "strength lies in vulnerability," is explicitly stated multiple times, functioning as a thesis statement rather than an emergent property of the narrative. The final paragraphs devolve into summarizing the moral, a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with overt explanation, triggering a significant penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of remembrance is woven through the narrative, culminating in the resonant final image of the box as a "beacon in the darkness." However, the story occasionally slips into direct thematic statement, as with "the recluse stood as a testament to the power of remembrance," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating what was already shown. This prevents it from achieving flawless thematic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of finding new meaning after collapse is coherent and emerges from the story's central premise. However, the execution lacks subtlety. The final paragraphs tend to summarize the thematic takeaway directly, such as calling the capsule "a catalyst for growth." This verges on thematic moralizing, explaining the story's meaning to the reader rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story suffers from severe thematic overstatement, particularly in its second half. Instead of allowing the theme to emerge from images, the narration repeatedly summarizes it ("a symbol of the transience and beauty of life," "connected to the very fabric of existence"). This thematic moralizing replaces earned resonance with a direct, and thus less powerful, statement of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of interspecies respect is handled with excessive directness, robbing the story of subtext and nuance. The narrative repeatedly states its moral, culminating in final paragraphs that read like a thematic summary. This heavy-handed approach, a clear example of thematic echo, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story’s particulars and leaves no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is repeatedly stated using the story's key jargon ("artificial pilgrimage," "chemistry of homecoming"), which undermines subtext and resonance. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the thematic takeaway, functioning as a moral rather than an earned, emergent insight. This heavy-handedness, particularly the line "shaped by the chemistry of homecoming" at the end, is a clear instance of Thematic Echo that prevents the story from resonating beyond its declared intent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of renewal is clear but delivered with a heavy hand, violating the principle of emergence. The final paragraphs explicitly state the story's meaning ("letting a garden reclaim a battlefield," "land... on the path to healing"), a form of thematic moralizing that undermines the resonance of the final image. The concept of "submerged concord" is an asserted label rather than a demonstrated truth.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding hope in desolation is evident but is delivered with a heavy hand. The story resorts to explicitly stating its own meaning, as seen in "The message was a call to translate distance into closeness, to find a way to bring life to the barren landscape." This thematic echo replaces subtext with summary. While the final image of the spring is resonant, the preceding lack of subtlety prevents the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding direction in stillness is present, but the final paragraphs resort to explicit thematic summary. Lines like "once a symbol of stagnation, had become a catalyst for her journey" state the story's moral directly, undermining the resonance of the closing images by replacing subtext with an overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of restoring balance and embracing wonder is clear but handled with a lack of subtlety. The story's final paragraph explicitly summarizes its intentions ("Their journey... was far from over, and the world would soon feel the touch of their sacredly playful nature"). This thematic moralizing replaces the resonance that should emerge from a powerful final image, undercutting the story's potential for lingering ambiguity and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story is heavily thematic but lacks subtlety. The theme is often stated directly, as when the historian's words are described as "weaving together... a tapestry of meaning," or when key phrases are literally spelled out on the floor. This overtness borders on didacticism, weakening the resonance that should emerge organically from subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece successfully evokes themes of memory, loss, and creation, culminating in a resonant final image rather than a stated moral. The central ideas emerge organically from the seer's quest and discovery. However, some phrases, such as "a time after remembering becomes painful," tread dangerously close to being explicit thematic statements, slightly undermining the otherwise effective subtext and emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of forgiveness as an internal journey is coherent and well-integrated into the plot's structure. The tapestry threads evolving from a symbol of failure to a map for redemption is a strong move. The score is significantly lowered by the story's tendency to state its theme directly in phrases like "forgiveness was a journey, not a destination" and the final paragraph's moralizing summary. This robs the final images of their resonant power by explaining them to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme is central to the concept, its execution is marred by explicit and repetitive statements. The final five paragraphs devolve into a summary of the story's meaning, a critical flaw ("Thematic Echo") that replaces earned resonance with overt moralizing. The line "The price of forgiveness was a theme that haunted her" is an early sign of this heavy-handed approach.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed, repetitive statements rather than emerging from events. Phrases like "kintsugi intentions" and "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" are used as explicit labels three times each, functioning as a thesis statement instead of a resonant subtext. This thematic moralizing, especially in the final paragraphs, replaces earned emotional insight with a declarative summary, a critical flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of capturing "temporary eternity" through art is clear and consistently present, but its execution is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly uses the exact phrase "temporary eternity" as a label, which functions as a thematic summary that undermines resonance. This overt moralizing, particularly in the final paragraphs, replaces the power of an emergent, subtextual theme with a direct, and ultimately less impactful, statement.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a critical thematic echo, explicitly stating its theme: "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts." This direct statement preempts any emergent discovery by the reader, turning the narrative into a demonstration of a thesis rather than an exploration. The final image resonates, but only in service of a moral that has already been plainly articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of rebuilding from fragments and confronting loss is resonant and well-integrated. The final image of acceptance before a "vast expanse of nothingness" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the story occasionally lapses into stating its themes too directly, with phrases like "to navigate the geography of loss" and "a topography of loss and memory," which slightly undermine the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story explores compelling themes of trauma, empathy, and individuality. The final image of "fractured grace" offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the theme is often delivered through direct summary ("The forager's findings painted a picture...") instead of emerging purely from scene, which undermines its power and feels authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of borrowed memories emerges organically from the initial setup but is ultimately undermined by over-explanation. The story repeatedly states its own themes, such as calling the boutonnière a "key" and the lighthouse a "repository of sorts." The final paragraphs devolve into direct summary ("a symbol of the borrowed memories"), a classic case of Thematic Echo that replaces resonant subtext with a tidy moral, significantly weakening the story's lasting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thematic points about legacy and choice are delivered through overt, declarative statements, violating the principle of showing over telling. Lines like "Emilia realized that her father's legacy lived on through her" and "the doorway of decisions was not a single point, but a series of choices" function as authorial moralizing. This direct explanation of the theme preempts any resonant subtext the final images might have carried.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story raises thematic questions about destiny and forbidden knowledge but fails to investigate them. Instead of a resonant final image that provides a non-literal answer, the last paragraph explicitly states "The queen's journey had only just begun," which deflates any thematic weight and reframes the piece as an unfinished prologue rather than a complete story.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is stated too directly and repeatedly, relying on keywords like "revalue," "returning differently," and "density of presence." The story's final paragraph explicitly summarizes its moral ("a reminder of the power of directed spontaneity..."), a clear instance of the "thematic echo" anti-pattern. This replaces earned resonance with a tidy explanation, undermining the potential for subtler, image-driven meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of creativity's power to process trauma is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The final paragraphs fall into the trap of summarizing the story's moral explicitly, stating "it was a reminder of the power of creativity." This thematic echo replaces the resonance of the final image with a direct statement, undermining subtext and costing the ending its evocative power.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered with excessive directness, violating the principle of showing over telling. Phrases like "reading between the lines," "unveil its hidden beauty," and "humanize the mundane" function as explicit authorial statements rather than emergent insights. The final paragraphs moralize and summarize the story's meaning, a clear example of Thematic Echo that prevents the theme from resonating through subtext or a powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of creativity emerging from the balance of turmoil and stillness is clear, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The mentor's words—"the true power of the runes crystallizes when stressed, much like the delicate balance between the tranquility and turmoil"—function as a thematic echo, explicitly stating the story's thesis. While the final image is resonant, this direct explanation prevents the theme from emerging organically from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is handled with excessive directness, severely undermining its literary potential. The story explicitly states its central concept multiple times, culminating in final-paragraph moralizing ("...it's the imperfect, gritted moments that hold the most beauty"). This thematic-echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, a significant flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of unity is not emergent but is explicitly stated multiple times, particularly in the final paragraphs. The story ends with several summary statements about its own meaning, such as being "a testament to the power of the human spirit." This heavy-handed moralizing replaces earned resonance with a direct explanation of the theme, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of time's nature is the story's entire focus, but it is handled with a lack of subtlety, frequently articulated through direct authorial statements. Lines like "Was it merely a human construct, or did it tap into something deeper?" function as explicit thematic summaries rather than questions emerging from subtext. This over-articulation prevents the theme from resonating, turning the narrative into an illustration of a concept rather than an exploration of it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=2.8)
    Thematic intentions are stated directly and repeatedly, violating the principle of emergence. Phrases like "understand the physics of letting go" and "navigate through permeable barriers" function as labels rather than earned insights. The ending explicitly summarizes the theme ("The world... was revealing itself to be a complex, interconnected web"), which reads as authorial moralizing. This approach leaves no room for subtext or ambiguity, presenting a tidy thesis instead of allowing meaning to resonate from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's primary weakness lies in its lack of subtext; the theme is stated directly and repeatedly. Phrases like "widen his perspectives, to see that the world was full of complexities and contradictions" function as authorial moralizing. The final paragraphs summarize the thematic takeaway, a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a tidy explanation, triggering a significant penalty for Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic statements that replace subtext with direct explanation. Phrases like "to teach endings how to begin" and "a community bound together by the threads of cultivated estrangement" function as authorial morals. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("they had truly taught endings how to begin"), which significantly undermines the potential for emergent resonance and triggers a substantial penalty for moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=1.8)
    The story fails catastrophically due to its heavy-handed thematic delivery. Instead of allowing themes to emerge from subtext and action, it repeatedly states them in declarative sentences. The entire second half functions as a thematic summary, explicitly telling the reader about the "enduring power of love" and the "importance of preserving the past." This replaces earned resonance with a pre-digested moral, a textbook example of the "thematic echo" anti-pattern that nullifies any potential for subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of connection curing loneliness emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct thematic statements ("The cure for loneliness was not a single event..."). This thematic echo replaces resonant imagery with overt moralizing, weakening the subtlety of an otherwise effective ending.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding harmony between the internal self and the external universe emerges organically from the story's core conceit and imagery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the character's quest. However, the theme is slightly undermined by occasional direct statements ("journey to navigate the uncharted emotional depths") and the repetitive use of the phrase "quiet blaze," which feels like a thematic label being insisted upon.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of narrative power and "editing history" is central but handled with a heavy hand. Instead of emerging from subtext, it is repeatedly stated directly, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the theme explicitly ("a testament to the power of editing history"). This thematic echo undercuts the potential for resonance, replacing earned insight with a declarative moral.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory, connection, and the beauty found in silence is powerfully and coherently explored. The final image of the film-less camera offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. However, the score is slightly tempered by a few lines that verge on direct thematic statement, such as, "For in this moment, when no one remembers you, the whispers of the past are all that remain," which slightly reduces the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic statements, particularly in its final paragraphs. Phrases like "a testament to the power of art to transcend time" and "it was not just a story of a lost civilization, but of the human spirit" are prime examples of Thematic Echo. This direct moralizing replaces earned resonance, telling the reader the story's meaning instead of letting it emerge from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story suffers from overtly stating its themes. Instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action and image, it provides explanations, such as describing the vision as a world where "the collective unconscious was a source of strength." The final paragraphs devolve into summarizing the story's meaning, which significantly undermines the potential for resonance and feels like a response to a prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated multiple times, culminating in the final sentence: "...sometimes it was the quietest voices that traveled the farthest." This heavy-handed moralizing prevents any meaningful subtext or ambiguity from emerging. The story serves as a straightforward illustration of its thesis rather than an exploration, leaving no room for reader interpretation and feeling more like a fable with a declared moral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story’s thematic potential is severely undercut by a critical flaw: a direct authorial statement that functions as a thematic echo. The line "to teach darkness the value of stars" explicitly states a motivation and theme that should have emerged organically from subtext and imagery. While the final image of the stars provides a resonant bookend, this act of telling robs the story of its power of discovery and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of promoting thoughtfulness through quiet action is clear and consistent. However, it is delivered with a heavy hand. Lines like "the air thick with the scent of second thoughts" and the final paragraphs, which summarize the story's meaning, fall into the trap of overt moralizing. The theme is stated and illustrated rather than allowed to emerge from resonant particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding freedom through self-acceptance is coherent and central. However, the story leans heavily on direct thematic statements, particularly in its climax ("the disappearing island was not a place, but a state of being") and conclusion. This explicit moralizing, or "Thematic Echo," preempts subtext and lessens the resonance that a more imagistic or implicit ending might have achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from significant thematic echo, repeatedly stating its central ideas instead of allowing them to emerge through subtext. Phrases like "a poignant reminder of the transience of beauty" and "cultivating lightness in grief" function as authorial explanations. This flaw is most damaging in the final paragraph, which explicitly interprets the ending's meaning, robbing the final image of its resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme emerges organically from the imagery for most of the piece, but is significantly weakened by explicit, redundant thematic summaries in the final paragraphs, such as "a reminder of the transformative power of art."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is central, but it is heavily over-stated rather than emerging through subtext. The story repeatedly tells the reader its message, as in "the courtyard remained a testament to the power of imperfection." This direct moralizing, especially in the closing paragraphs, functions as a thematic summary that replaces the need for resonant imagery to carry the meaning, severely weakening the piece's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of connection is handled with excessive directness, repeatedly stated in phrases like "the texture of connection that bound all things." This heavy-handed approach leaves no room for subtext or earned discovery, functioning as a Thematic Echo. The ending provides a summary of the theme rather than a resonant image that re-contextualizes the narrative's core question.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a lack of subtext, stating its theme directly and repeatedly. Lines like "teach withering to bloom again" and "transmute their grief into something beautiful" function as authorial explanations rather than emergent truths. The final paragraphs deliver a tidy moral ("even in the darkest moments, beauty was always possible"), which undercuts the potential for resonance. This thematic echo in the closure beat significantly weakens the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme, a blend of scientific precision and ancient mystery as a response to modern chaos, is compelling. However, its delivery is overly explicit. The final paragraphs state the theme directly ("reverse engineering was not just about deciphering patterns, but about uncovering the hidden narratives that shaped human destiny"), functioning as a thematic summary that weakens the resonance of the final image, preventing it from doing the work on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is clear but handled with a heavy hand. Key concepts like "atoms of nostalgia" and "anguished joy" are repeated verbatim, functioning more as labels than emergent ideas. The story explicitly summarizes its own theme in the penultimate paragraphs ("It was a story of discovery, of transformation..."), a direct thematic statement that undermines earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of hope's resilience against collective fear is central and developed through consistent imagery (library, stone, shadow). However, the story verges on thematic summary with phrases like "a manifestation of humanity's deepest fears." The final image is resonant, but the thematic expression lacks subtext, stating its conclusions a little too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from thematic overstatement. Core themes like "the delicate balance between self-respect and compassion" and "shedding layers to reveal a deeper truth" are repeatedly stated directly in the narration. This replaces subtext with explicit summary, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a moral, a clear example of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern that undermines any earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story's themes of interconnectedness and finding meaning in trauma are explicit to the point of being didactic. Phrases like "to unravel the mysteries hidden in the tissue of reality" and "the intricate web of connections" function as authorial explanations rather than emergent insights. This heavy-handedness robs the final image of its potential resonance, turning it into an illustration of a pre-stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from overtly stating its theme multiple times, which undermines the power of its imagery. Lines like "a testament to the enduring power of love" act as thematic summaries that replace earned resonance. This violates the principle of showing theme through subtext and results in a final paragraph that feels like a moral, explicitly penalized by the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of unlocking creativity by connecting with the universe is clear, but its delivery is too direct, violating the principle of emergence. Lines like "To free trapped creativity..." and the final paragraph's moral ("the universe was always speaking, if one only took the time to listen") function as overt thematic statements. This authorial explanation preempts resonance and feels like a summary of intent rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of rebirth from destruction emerges organically through the story’s central imagery—blooming flora vs. charred remains, a reactivated clock, and cultivated light. The final image of the ticking clock as a symbol of "the world's rebirth" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension without resorting to overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of exploring consciousness is central, but its execution lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly states its thematic aims ("unravel the mysteries," "explore the uncharted territories") and ends with a summary that feels like a Thematic Echo. While the final image of the rainforest as a gateway is resonant, it's weakened by the preceding prose that over-explains its own meaning, leaving little for the reader to discover.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding courage through a liminal journey emerges organically from the story's imagery and actions. The final image of the revealed path offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the repeated phrase "unused courage" verges on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise effective subtext by stating the core concept too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of safety versus selfhood is central but handled with too much direct statement, which undermines subtext. The final two paragraphs explicitly summarize the story's meaning ("Their story was one of frostbitten hope, a tale of resilience..."), a clear instance of thematic echo that tells the reader what to think. This replaces earned resonance with a stated moral, significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story's theme of truth triumphing over ambition is clear, but it's delivered with heavy-handed moralizing in the final paragraphs. Lines like "...a reminder of the power of truth and the unyielding dedication of those who sought to reveal it" function as a thematic summary, undermining the potential for resonant subtext. The story doesn't trust the reader to grasp the theme from the events, instead stating it directly, which flattens the piece's literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme exploring the limits of rationalism versus intuitive understanding emerges organically from the plot. The torn atlas page and the drum are effective, recurring motifs that support this theme without being heavy-handed. However, the story occasionally verges on stating its theme too directly, as in lines like "a testament to the power of the ocean's eternal rhythms," which slightly undermines the subtextual resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of rediscovering purpose emerges organically from the narrative journey and recurring motifs. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, though a few lines near the end drift close to overtly stating the thematic takeaway, slightly reducing its subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme is delivered through overt, repetitive statements rather than emerging organically from the action. Phrases like "evolve tradition with intent" and "the role she was meant to play" function as authorial moralizing. The final paragraphs devolve into a summary of the story's meaning, a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with explicit explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of resilience and finding sanctuary emerges organically from the imagery, particularly the evolving symbolism of the trees and the photograph. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "to anchor optimism in realism" and the final paragraph's summation of hope feel like authorial moralizing, replacing earned resonance with a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding purpose in fragmentation is initially developed well through imagery. However, the story repeatedly undermines its subtext with overt thematic statements. The final paragraphs devolve into summarizing the story's moral ("a testament to the power of art," the journey becoming a "beacon...guiding others"), a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a heavy-handed, unearned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme exploring perception, patterns, and time is ambitious, and the disappearing ink serves as a potent central metaphor. Unfortunately, the story abandons subtext in the final paragraphs, explicitly stating its thematic conclusion ("a glimpse into the mystery of time's slowing... a newfound appreciation for the intricate patterns"). This summarization replaces earned resonance with a direct, and thus less powerful, moral.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.5)
    While a coherent theme of truth versus stability emerges, the story undermines its resonance through over-statement. Key thematic ideas are articulated directly rather than allowed to surface through subtext and image. The final paragraphs devolve into summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("she had given voice to a silence...") which substantially weakens the impact of an otherwise strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of creating order from chaos is clear and developed through potent central images (roses vs. sword). However, the story sometimes resorts to direct thematic statements, such as "she was determined to weave continuity through the chaos," which slightly undermines the subtext. The concept of "engraved quiet" is also articulated more as a label than an emergent property of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding profound meaning in silence and unconventional patterns emerges organically from the story’s events. The narrative avoids overt moralizing, allowing concepts like "voicing silence" and "sleepwalking constellations" to carry thematic weight through action. The final image of the constellations forming a new pattern provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the fisher's quest, creating a lingering sense of quiet magic.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic concerns of truth, legacy, and regret are clear, but their delivery lacks subtlety. Key ideas are often stated directly or repeated verbatim (e.g., "orbits of regret," "Wychwood name was synonymous with truth, not regret"), which feels like thematic summary. While the final image is resonant, this reliance on direct statement prevents the theme from emerging with full organic power.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story explores compelling themes of guilt and healing through art, but undermines its own subtext with overt summary. The line, "The haunted firmware, it seemed, was a manifestation of her own inner turmoil, and by confronting it, she had begun to heal," is a critical flaw. This explicit thematic statement removes ambiguity and replaces earned resonance with a direct explanation, significantly weakening the piece's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges clearly from the story’s events and imagery. However, it relies too heavily on direct thematic statements and repetition of key phrases ("meaning in the mess," "lilac unease"). The final explicit mention, "as if she had finally discovered meaning in the mess," functions as a thematic echo that undermines the subtext by stating the moral outright.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from a heavy-handed delivery of its theme, violating the principle of emergence. Rather than allowing meaning to arise from particulars, the narrative explicitly states its concepts ("aberrant mercy," "resilience and hope") multiple times. The final two paragraphs function as a thematic summary, a clear instance of moralizing that replaces the resonance of the final image with an explanation of it.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding redemption through confronting a fragmented past emerges organically from the story's central magical conceit. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statement, undermining the resonance built through imagery. The line "...a reminder that even in the most fractured of timelines, there was always the possibility of redemption" is an unnecessary moral that replaces scene pressure with summary, weakening the story's otherwise potent conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of discovering organic, internal pathways to creativity is coherent and emerges from the plot. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements. The line "Her motivation was clear: to illuminate the unseen connections that bound her art, her science, and her very self" functions as a thematic summary that would be more powerful if left implicit in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    While themes of discovery and connection to the past are present, they are delivered through direct statement rather than emerging from subtext. The final paragraphs devolve into a summary of the story's meaning, explicitly telling the reader what to feel. The line "The transitional objects, the heat-mapping, and the sensory maps all blended together in a rich tapestry of discovery" is a critical flaw, replacing earned resonance with a thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story engages with its themes directly, but to a fault. The final paragraphs resort to overt thematic statements ("the prophecy was not a fixed destiny, but a raw possibility," "the alchemy of shared wisdom"), which reads as authorial summary. This replaces earned resonance with a stated moral, significantly weakening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of subtext, repeatedly stating its themes directly. Phrases like "mend what had been broken" and "find where unused courage waits" are used like thesis statements, culminating in a final paragraph that explicitly summarizes the story's meaning. This thematic moralizing, a severe anti-pattern, replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, fundamentally undermining the piece's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of distilling complexity is handled with too much directness, violating the principle of emergence. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thematic achievement: "...he had finally uncovered the essence of the palimpsest promise, and had distilled complexity into simplicity." This is a clear case of "Thematic Echo," where the story tells the reader its moral instead of trusting the images to convey it. The powerful atmosphere is undercut by this lack of subtext at the crucial final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the theme is coherent, its delivery is a critical flaw. The story abandons subtext and states its core message directly: "some places resist change because they are infused with the kindness of those who once tended them." This thematic moralizing in the final act fundamentally undermines the otherwise subtle, resonant build-up, replacing an earned, emergent understanding with a neat, authorial summary. This is a significant misstep for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of nurturing hidden beauty is potent and well-integrated with the central gardener/lockmaster metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. Lines like "Their goal was... to reflect light into the dark corners" and the immediate repetition of this motive function as thematic labels, a flaw that prevents the theme from emerging with full organic power from the particulars of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story's theme is undermined by overt and repetitive statements, falling into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern. Phrases like "brittle awakenings" and the goal to "translate isolation into independence" are stated multiple times, replacing subtext with direct summary. This prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of connection being created rather than found is clear, but its delivery is a critical failure. The story explicitly states its moral in the final act: "she realized that the thread she had been seeking was not something to be found, but something to be created." This thematic echo replaces resonant subtext with a tidy summary, severely undermining the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via direct statement rather than emerging from character and action. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the story's moral ("the power of determination and ingenuity"), a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with overt moralizing. Subtext is absent, and the piece misses the opportunity for complexity or ambiguity, resolving into a simplistic message.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic moralizing in its conclusion. Instead of allowing the theme to emerge from the events, the narrator explicitly summarizes it with lines like "a testament to the power of prudently adventurous spirits" and "a new cycle... guided by the wistful rebellion." This direct statement of the moral replaces earned resonance, a significant flaw for this publication.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered with a heavy hand, undermining potential for subtext and resonance. Key ideas are explicitly stated in abstract language ("the dual nature of human identity," "unify opposites"). The final paragraphs devolve into overt moralizing, explaining the "truth they had been seeking." This is a critical failure of Thematic Echo, replacing an earned, emergent theme with a direct authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story effectively explores themes of legacy, identity, and the porous boundary between past and present through its central mystery. The concept of "reversible exile" and truth lying "in the spaces between" words is intriguing. However, the thematic exploration sometimes veers into direct statement, such as calling the stanzas "a gateway to a deeper understanding," which slightly undermines the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of art's redemptive power is present but handled with extreme didacticism. The story repeatedly states its own thesis, with phrases like "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" and "a testament to the power of art to transform and redeem" appearing multiple times, especially in the final third. This heavy-handed moralizing replaces earned resonance with overt summary, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of finding value in failed journeys is overt and repeatedly stated, violating the principle of showing over telling. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize, stating "the value of a journey lay not in its destination, but in the stories it told." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy, declarative summary, significantly weakening the story's literary quality by leaving no room for interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "shared burdens" is handled with excessive directness, undermining its potential for resonance. The story repeatedly states its thesis, for instance: "The temple inscriptions spoke of an ancient people who had understood the value of shared burdens." This thematic telling, especially in the final paragraphs, functions as a moral summary that replaces the need for subtext and earned insight, significantly weakening the piece for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, undermining resonance. The story repeatedly states its central question ("discover what mirrors don't show") and then provides a direct, summarized answer in the climax: "What mirrors don't show, the druid realized, was... a glimpse into the soul." This is a critical thematic echo that functions as a moral, replacing earned, emergent meaning with a simple explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of uncovering hidden realities and shaping one's own future emerges organically from the central journey into the maze. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statement, which weakens the resonance. Lines like "The world, it seemed, was full of hidden patterns and secret pathways..." explicitly state the moral of the story, a "Thematic Echo" that replaces the power of the final image with unnecessary explanation, incurring a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of self-empowerment and healing is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for resonant subtext. The final paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral ("she knew that she would carry the lessons of the catacomb orchard with her"), a thematic summary that replaces earned insight with a platitude. This heavy-handed approach prevents the story's images from developing genuine symbolic power.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of finding a new beginning is clear but lacks subtlety, suffering from the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern. The final third of the story devolves into a series of direct statements that explain the story's moral ("it's in the quiet moments that we find our true voice"). This authorial moralizing replaces the resonant, image-driven closure the piece was building toward.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of interconnectedness is handled with a lack of subtlety, culminating in a direct thematic statement: "Elara realized that the secret lay not in the individual components, but in the relationships between them." This declarative approach replaces earned resonance with a simple moral. The story tells the reader its theme rather than allowing it to emerge organically from concrete events, resulting in an ending that feels more like a summary than a resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of finding meaning through fluid identity and mindful routine is the story's entire focus, but it is delivered through direct, essayistic statements rather than emergent discovery. Sentences like "The librarian's presence...was a testament to the concept of migrating identities" function as overt thematic labels, leaving no room for subtext or ambiguity. This approach replaces resonant storytelling with a philosophical treatise, and the final image feels like a summary rather than an earned, resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.4)
    While a coherent theme of connection emerges, the story undermines it with overt moralizing in the final paragraphs. The line "that the power to connect with others lay within, waiting to be uncovered" is a thematic summary that replaces the resonance of the final image. This direct statement flattens the complexity and feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, undermining its potential resonance. The story explicitly states its central idea—"forgiveness is a map, not a destination"—multiple times, turning subtext into text. This thematic echoing in the final paragraphs feels like a moral summary, replacing the power of the final image with a neat, unearned platitude and removing any meaningful ambiguity for the reader to contemplate.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme is skillfully integrated, exploring the nature of knowledge as an internal state rather than an external goal. The story avoids moralizing, and the final realization ("not a destination, but a state of being") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central quest. The recurring image of the watch effectively recharges at the end, becoming a symbol of the journey itself.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit labels like "perforated destiny" and the stated goal to "propagate this notion." This transforms the narrative into a thesis statement, violating the principle of emergent theme. The story tells us its meaning directly rather than allowing it to arise from character action and resonant imagery, resulting in a piece that feels more like an outline than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding transcendent beauty in the face of mortality emerges organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the glowing emerald chip is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The story loses a few points for slightly overt thematic language near the end, such as "fragment of the divine," which borders on stating its own message.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme of accepting the "cycle of rebirth" is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative repeatedly states its own thesis, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary. This heavy-handedness forecloses any meaningful subtext or ambiguity, turning a potentially resonant idea into a simple, declared lesson. This is a clear case of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from severe thematic overstatement. Core themes like "welcome nuance into certainty" and "the world was not always black and white" are repeatedly stated directly, particularly in the final paragraphs. This thematic moralizing replaces earned resonance with a summary of intent, a critical flaw ("Thematic Echo"). The final image in the mirror is potent, but it is unfortunately suffocated by the surrounding explicit explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of delayed revelation is clearly and consistently explored through the central metaphor of ripples in a pond. The story succeeds in linking its concept to its imagery. However, the exploration is overly direct and lacks subtext, explaining its own meaning rather than allowing it to emerge. The tidy, successful ending offers a simple moral about understanding, missing the opportunity for resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme of interconnectedness through stillness emerges organically at first, the latter half of the story devolves into explicit thematic summary. Lines like "The skimmer's story was one of patience and persistence..." function as authorial moralizing, a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with a concluding essay. This significantly undermines the piece's literary potential by refusing to trust the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of finding authentic creativity in an automated world is explicit but lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly states its message, culminating in lines like, "The garden, the folly, and the keystone were all testaments to the power of creativity and imagination." This direct moralizing, or thematic echo, replaces the resonance that should emerge from image and action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme of synesthetic perception and hidden knowledge is intriguing, it's conveyed through direct statement rather than emergent subtext. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the story's meaning ("The luminous vows... were not just a promise, but a doorway..."), functioning as a thematic echo that undermines the power of the closing image. The epiphany is told to the reader, not discovered with the character.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding one's purpose within a grand cosmic design emerges organically from the imagery. The final image is resonant, and the return of "stellar doubt" cleverly complicates what could have been a simplistic moral. However, the theme is occasionally weakened by on-the-nose statements in the latter half, such as "they had fulfilled their role" and "their purpose had been fulfilled," which veer close to thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story explores compelling themes of memory, grief, and connection, but its method is overly declarative. The prose is saturated with abstract thematic labels like "the echo of sacrifice," "unyielding passage of time," and "distant intimacy." The final paragraphs devolve into summary, explicitly stating that the atlas page is "a testament to the power of sacrifice," which severely undermines the resonance that the imagery attempts to build.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story's theme is undermined by its lack of subtlety. Key concepts like "brittle devotion" and "plausible impossibility" are explicitly stated and repeated, functioning more as authorial labels than emergent ideas. The final paragraph devolves into direct moralizing ("...the knowledge that even the most brittle devotion could be made whole again."), a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with a tidy, pre-packaged lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of healing through narrative is not emergent but is instead stated explicitly and repetitively throughout the text. Phrases like "spin stories into shared meaning" function as didactic labels rather than conclusions drawn from events. The final paragraphs are particularly guilty of thematic echo, summarizing the story's purpose and undermining any potential for subtext or resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme emerges clearly from the events, but the story undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. Phrases like "a code that spoke to the harmony she sought" and the paragraph summarizing the experience as "exhilarating and humbling" function as thematic labels. This direct moralizing prevents the theme from resonating with the complexity and ambiguity expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of duty and the burden of vigilance is central but is handled with a heavy hand. Key thematic concepts like "the watcher's burden" are stated repeatedly, functioning as direct labels rather than emerging organically from the action. This over-articulation, a form of thematic echo, prevents the development of subtext and leaves little for the reader to infer, cheapening the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of identity is present but is delivered through direct, overt statements rather than emerging from subtext. Lines like "Kaito knew that he had finally found what he had been searching for - a sense of self that was not defined by external events" function as thematic moralizing. This approach replaces resonant imagery with explanation, triggering the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern and weakening the story's emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of mystery sparking innovation is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The story explicitly tells the reader the seed is a "catalyst for her imagination" and a "symbol of the mystery that had sparked a new wave of innovation." This thematic moralizing in the final paragraphs replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, significantly weakening its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the theme of healing through art is present, the story undermines its own subtext with heavy-handed moralizing. The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme with lines like "...a testament to the power of tending to the unspoken" and "...a tale of...the power of music to heal the deepest wounds." This is a clear case of "Thematic Echo," which replaces earned resonance with a direct, artless summary of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding clarity by embracing ambiguity emerges organically from the central conflict and imagery. The final image of the pendant as a beacon is resonant. However, the story occasionally veers into thematic summary, with phrases like "grasp the true nature of the boundaries of light" reading like direct statements of purpose rather than earned, subtextual insights.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness. The story explicitly states its core concept ("creative destruction") and summarizes its thematic resolution in the final paragraphs ("shatter the chains of fate," "a new path had been forged"). This thematic echo in the final beats replaces earned resonance with a stated moral, significantly undermining the story's literary potential by telling the reader its meaning instead of letting it emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in decay and the cyclical nature of existence is present but delivered with a heavy hand. Instead of emerging from particulars, the theme is explicitly stated in multiple places, most egregiously in the final paragraphs ("...a reminder that in a world of wonder, the art of discovery was a lifelong journey."). This direct moralizing, a form of thematic echo, replaces earned resonance with a summary, preventing the story from inviting deeper reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of interconnected realities is present, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Phrases like "understanding the interconnected patterns that governed the universe" and the final articulation of "permanent transient-ness" state the theme directly, functioning as thematic labels. The strong final image of the world as an hourglass rescues the score, but the piece leans too heavily on assertion rather than letting meaning emerge solely from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "rational enchantment" is central but handled with a heavy hand. Key thematic phrases are repeated so frequently they function as labels rather than emergent ideas, a form of Thematic Echo. While the final images are resonant, the story consistently tells the reader its theme instead of trusting the subtext of the architect's experience, which reduces the potential for deeper reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story fails by repeatedly stating its theme instead of allowing it to emerge from events. Phrases like "a metaphorical key to unlocking the mysteries of the cosmos" and the final paragraphs function as overt moralizing. This heavy-handed approach eliminates all subtext and reduces the narrative to a simple thematic essay.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of memory, connection, and grief are present but are delivered too explicitly. Instead of emerging from subtext, they are stated directly in phrases like "protect vulnerable voices, to keep the memories of the dead alive." The final paragraphs lapse into thematic summary, labeling Aria's actions as "incidental heroism." This overt moralizing in the final third undermines the resonance that the imagery and atmosphere worked to build.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme of honoring the past is delivered via direct statement rather than emerging from subtext. The line "to stand by the unremembered" and its reprise in the final paragraph function as an authorial summary of meaning. This "Thematic Echo" flattens complexity and prevents the story from achieving resonance through image or implication, instead offering the reader a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story builds a coherent theme of finding wisdom in failure and transience, but it undermines its own subtext with an overly direct thematic statement. The line, "She realized that her journey was not about uncovering the truth... but about fetching wisdom from the failure," functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral instead of letting it resonate through image and action. This significantly reduces the story's literary power and incurs a heavy penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of translation, creation, and the preservation of memory through art is beautifully integrated. It emerges organically from the central images: the "flawed diamond" representing imperfect beauty as a source of power, and the translation of ephemeral patterns (bird flight, shadows) into a lasting lexicon. The final image of the canyon imbued with a new, evolving language provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of loss, avoiding any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thematic development suffers from overt and repetitive statements that function like labels. Phrases such as "harmony untamed" and "frostbitten hope" are heavily relied upon, culminating in direct thematic summary rather than emergent meaning. The line "the key to making sense of the chaos lay in turning bitterness into a cosmic joke" is a clear example of thematic telling that preempts any resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme of art reawakening a mechanical world is asserted directly and repeatedly, leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The final paragraphs devolve into pure summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("Luna's music had broken free the beauty that was dormant..."). This heavy-handed moralizing negates any potential for resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of hope and redemption is heavily over-stated, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative explicitly tells the reader the protagonist's thematic hopes and, most egregiously, summarizes the story’s meaning in the final paragraphs. Lines like "contributing to a larger narrative of redemption" and the conclusion about unleashing a "tempest - one of hope and redemption" are thematic labels that replace the resonance that the central image of the delivered storm could have achieved on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in stillness is potent, but its execution is marred by direct, summary-like statements. Lines like "hope and beauty born from silence" and "a testament to the power of silence" function as thematic moralizing, replacing subtext with assertion. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern is particularly pronounced in the final paragraphs, preventing the story from achieving the resonance that its imagery and atmosphere work so hard to build.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of stories as living entities is woven organically through the narrative's imagery and actions. The final image of the smiling librarian and the pulsing stories offers a resonant, earned conclusion. However, the final paragraphs verge on thematic summary, with lines like "...made the world a richer, more wondrous place" slightly overstating the theme instead of letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of finding purpose in an unattainable pursuit is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Key thematic concepts like "cipher of longing" and "luminous absence" are repeated like labels, leaving little room for subtext or emergent meaning. The final paragraph functions as a direct thematic summary, which undermines the potential for resonant, image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of freeing trapped ideas is clear, and the final image of the shimmering light provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements, such as defining the lock of hair as "a tangible representation of an idea or memory" and stating the task is to free an idea "trapped behind fear." This explicit moralizing prevents the theme from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story explores compelling themes of memory and discovery, but its execution is hampered by thematic statements that replace subtext. The line "When habits break... it was essential to be adaptable" functions as an authorial moral rather than an earned insight. This thematic echoing, especially combined with the repetitive use of "crisp nostalgia," undermines the otherwise strong atmospheric work, making the theme feel imposed rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of mentoring resilience through meticulous, empathetic work emerges organically from the central action. The story effectively uses subtext, with the geometry of tea leaves and the topography of the soul serving as potent metaphors. However, the final sentence, "the very fabric of reality was a little more resilient, a little more whole," verges on overstating the theme, slightly diminishing the resonance of the otherwise powerful closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of renewal through a connection to nature emerges organically from the core action. However, the story frequently undermines its subtlety by stating its themes directly. The final paragraphs devolve into summary, explicitly telling the reader the story is "a reminder of the power of creativity and the magic that lay within the natural world"—a thematic echo that replaces resonant imagery with a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.7)
    A coherent theme about healing through quiet, meticulous work emerges from the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtext through heavy-handed repetition of thematic keywords. The final paragraphs devolve into direct thematic summary, with lines like "The restorer's art was one of quiet..." stating the moral explicitly and weakening the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence is clear, but it is delivered too explicitly, bordering on thematic statement. Lines like “to interpret silence with empathy became most apparent” function as authorial explanations rather than emergent truths. While the final image of the torn map becoming whole is a resonant thematic grace note, it follows a summary of the story's meaning rather than allowing the image to carry the full weight of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is central, but its delivery in the final paragraphs is too explicit. The line "To let go is not to release, but to reframe" is a strong beat, but the final paragraph over-articulates the takeaway, functioning as a thematic summary that slightly diminishes the resonance of the closing image. This is a classic "Thematic Echo" that states the moral instead of trusting the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of creative expression as a conduit to the unseen is clear, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly states its own thesis, most notably in the final paragraphs ("a testament to the power of creative expression..."). This thematic moralizing replaces the resonance that should emerge from the final image, undermining the subtext by making it explicit and violating the "show, don't tell" principle at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story's theme of finding connection and beauty in isolation is evident, but the final paragraphs resort to direct thematic statements. Lines like "The icebound world... seemed less isolated now... more a sanctuary, a place where love and loss were intertwined" function as a moral summary. This "thematic echo" undermines the resonance that should emerge from the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story's greatest weakness is its heavy-handed thematic exposition. Core concepts like "spooled wholeness" and "empty spaces remembered" are explicitly named and defined within the character's thoughts, functioning as a "Thematic Echo." This approach prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars, instead presenting a thesis that the narrative merely illustrates, which is a critical flaw in literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of art's value in the face of impermanence is central and culminates in a resonant final image. However, its power is significantly undercut by moments of overt telling. The line describing the coin's message, which "spoke of the limits of human understanding and the futility of seeking to capture the infinite within finite bounds," functions as a direct thematic statement, weakening the subtext and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "sociable isolation"—the lonely yet connecting nature of discovery—emerges organically from Eli's actions and internal state without being overtly stated until the phrase itself appears. The story avoids a simplistic moral, instead creating a resonant feeling through its final image of Eli, alone but poised for a journey. The quiet decision to withhold the discovery adds a layer of complexity to the theme of knowledge and community.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story's theme is stated too explicitly and repeatedly, particularly in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "...their craft was not just about repair, but about understanding the intricate dance of the universe" function as direct moralizing, leaving little for the reader to interpret. This reliance on telling the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or resonant imagery is a significant weakness, amounting to a "Thematic Echo."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of collective effort is delivered with didactic clarity, sacrificing subtext for direct statement. The final paragraphs function as a moral summary, explicitly telling the reader the story's meaning, such as Aria's spirit being "a reminder of the power of collective effort." This heavy-handed approach prevents any resonant ambiguity or earned insight from emerging organically from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story builds a coherent theme around finding and preserving beauty in a fragile, flawed existence, powerfully symbolized by the broken puppet head. The final act of whispering a lullaby is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the theme is occasionally weakened by overly explicit statements, such as the desire "to preserve the beauty that lay within the beautifully flawed fabric of existence," which feels like an authorial summary rather than emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of restoring order and providing hope is stated too directly, culminating in the line "was now a beacon of hope," which functions as a thematic summary. The glowing nut at the end is an overly sentimental and overt symbol that lacks subtlety. The piece forgoes ambiguity for a tidy moral, which feels unearned given the low stakes and straightforward resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the themes of connection, separation, and transformation are coherent, they are often stated directly instead of emerging through subtext. The line "The ravine...was a perfect metaphor for the complex, interconnected relationships" is a critical flaw, functioning as authorial explanation. This tendency towards thematic summary, especially in the latter half, significantly undermines the story's literary potential by telling the reader what to think.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.7)
    A coherent theme about the nature of stories emerges organically from the central conflict. The story effectively contrasts an extractive view of knowledge with a holistic one. However, the final third veers close to thematic summary, with lines like "she had finally found the place where stories begin" stating the conclusion too directly, which slightly diminishes the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of healing through processing trauma is central and coherent. The "sandpapering" metaphor is a strong anchor. However, the theme is often delivered through direct statement rather than emergent subtext, such as the line "Elara had sandpapered the rough memories." This over-articulation in key moments functions like a thematic echo, reducing the resonance that a more subtle approach would achieve.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of connection is clear but executed with a heavy hand. The final paragraph nearly states the theme directly ("the silos that had once stood as barriers now seemed to be bridging the gaps"), which echoes the initial setup ("construct bridges from silos") too neatly. This lack of subtext pushes the story toward a simple allegory, sacrificing complexity for thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of memory and recovery are central, but the story defaults to direct statement over subtext. The motivation is explained as a thesis: "...to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams." The ending commits a significant misstep by explicitly summarizing the thematic takeaway ("The experience had changed her, imbuing her with a newfound sense of purpose..."), which drains the final image of its resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of knowledge carrying responsibility is coherent and emerges from the plot. The "seeds of vigilance" motif is developed from a figurative concept to a tangible goal. However, the thematic point is stated too directly in the final act: "the archivist understood that the seeds of vigilance were not just a metaphor, but a tangible force." This explicit declaration preempts a more resonant, subtextual discovery for the reader, bordering on a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of art creating empathy in a desolate world emerges well from the central action. However, the story verges on stating its theme directly with prompt-like phrases such as "empathy into motion." This occasional thematic echo slightly undermines the subtext by telling the reader the story's purpose instead of letting it resonate entirely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of finding "beauty in the difficult" is undermined by being explicitly stated as a "mantra." The story's final paragraphs devolve into thematic summary, telling the reader that the tutor is now a "seeker of truth." This replaces resonant imagery with direct explanation, leaving no room for subtext or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of empathy is handled with excessive directness, reading more like an authorial thesis than an emergent property of the narrative. Lines like "The core concept of empathy was one that Elara held dear" and "recover the lost threads of connection" are thematic echoes that state the story's intent outright. This replaces subtext and earned resonance with overt moralizing, leaving no room for the reader to derive meaning from the events themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of finding wisdom within is present but delivered with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly states its core concepts ("undercurrent of wisdom," "cultivating serenity within motion") rather than allowing them to emerge from events. The final paragraph is particularly problematic, offering a direct moral statement: "She realized that the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered, but rather something that was always present..." This thematic echo replaces resonant imagery with a simplistic, sermonizing summary, reducing the story's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    A coherent theme emerges around the intersection of technology (the growth accelerator) and a deeper, natural energy (the echoes). The ending successfully lands the idea that nature's power surpasses human artifice. However, the final paragraphs verge on summarizing this theme directly ("The orchard's resilience was no longer a mystery"), which lessens the resonance that a purely image-driven conclusion might have offered. The "whirling silence" is a powerful central image, but the surrounding text over-explains its significance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story's theme of complex systems and human adaptation is undermined by its lack of subtext. Key thematic concepts ("singular convergence," "rapidly adapting response," "cultivation of foresight in action") are repeatedly stated outright, particularly in the final paragraphs. This thematic echoing replaces earned resonance with a direct summary of the story's moral, feeling like an explanation of the theme rather than an embodiment of it, which significantly harms the literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of art's power to reveal wonder is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative repeatedly states its own thesis, as in, "wonder was not just a fleeting emotion, but a fundamental aspect of existence." The final paragraph devolves into a summary of its meaning ("a testament to the power of art to reveal the deeper truths of existence"), a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered via an explicit thesis statement: "To harvest insights from failure was her true motivation." This is a critical flaw, as it replaces emergent meaning with direct authorial summary. The story tells the reader its theme instead of allowing it to arise from the character’s specific, conflicted struggle, which significantly undermines the potential for resonant subtext and earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of translating emotion through language and technology emerges organically from the plot. The final image is resonant, suggesting a profound shift in reality. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit labels like "transposed empathy" and "the mathematics of emotion." The final line, "a gentle reminder of the power of transposed empathy," functions as a thematic summary, slightly dulling the otherwise powerful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's theme is undermined by being stated explicitly and repetitively. The line "Eira's task was not just to retrieve relics, but to..." appears twice, functioning as a thesis summary that replaces earned resonance with a direct moral, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of hidden connections is central, but it's delivered through direct, repeated statements ("reveal the deep connections," "uncover the hidden patterns") rather than emerging purely from subtext and image. The final paragraphs tend to summarize the story's meaning, bordering on thematic moralizing which dilutes the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of mending connections through patient, creative action is woven effectively through the central metaphors of weaving and puzzle-solving. The final image of the thread as a lifeline provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the thematic development is hampered by repetitive, abstract phrasing like "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," which borders on stating the theme rather than letting it emerge purely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transformation is central but handled with a heavy hand, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative explicitly states its core concepts ("bartered awakenings," "coax resilience from the rubble") and the final paragraph devolves into a direct summary of the story's message. This "thematic echo" undermines the resonance that the imagery otherwise works to create, replacing earned subtext with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story aims for a theme of truth and perception but delivers it through direct statement rather than emergent meaning. The repeated phrase "withheld truth" functions as a thematic label, a critical anti-pattern. The final image of the character's return is meant to be resonant, but because the central discovery is a complete void for the reader, it lacks the weight to reconfigure prior material. The ending feels like an unearned summary of a theme rather than its dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story builds a coherent theme of finding meaning in stewardship and carrying collective sorrow. The final image of the skipper sailing away with his glowing sea glass is a resonant, non-literal answer to this. However, the theme is frequently over-stated, particularly with the repeated phrase "luminescent ache," which functions more as a label than an emergent feeling and slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme of ancient traditions versus a fleeting digital world is clear but delivered with a heavy hand. The final paragraphs devolve into direct thematic statements and moralizing ("the herald's role was more crucial than ever"), which replaces earned resonance with overt summary. This explicit telling undermines the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme emerges from the central metaphor of the wing, but the story undermines its own subtext by stating its conclusion directly. The line, "Kaito realized that some individuals, like the blue morpho wing, possessed a unique ability to refract and reflect the light..." is a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, a significant flaw in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic summary, repeatedly stating its message instead of allowing it to emerge from events. The final third is particularly problematic, with lines like "the ordinary and the extraordinary were intertwined" acting as authorial moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, significantly weakening the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of connection and hope is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or resonance. The prose explicitly defines its own metaphors ("woven dawns, a metaphor for the connections") and the final paragraphs summarize the moral. This heavy-handed thematic statement, a form of authorial intrusion, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the story effectively uses the crumpled invitation as a recurring object whose meaning evolves, its thematic delivery is overwhelmingly didactic. The narrative explicitly states its morals, first through the note ("truth is not in the answer, but in the question") and then in the final paragraph ("the truth is not in the destination, but in the journey itself"). This heavy-handed moralizing replaces resonant imagery with a simplistic summary, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of finding profundity in the ordinary is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The final paragraphs devolve into a summary of the story's meaning ("The bread... had been a key," "the most profound truths are found in the most ordinary of things"). This thematic moralizing fundamentally undermines the subtext and prevents the story from achieving resonance, reading like an explanation of itself.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of the past's living influence on the future emerges organically from the premise. However, the story undermines its subtext by repeatedly stating its themes in the final third. The line "her task was not just to catalog the remnants... but to illuminate the path forward" is a clear example of thematic moralizing that replaces earned resonance with direct summary, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story leans heavily on direct thematic statements, which undermines subtlety. The final two paragraphs explicitly summarize the moral ("a reminder of the power of determination and the secrets that lay hidden"), a critical failure that replaces earned resonance with a tidy explanation. Phrases like "truce of hush" feel like imposed motifs rather than emerging organically from the narrative particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of reconciling scientific understanding with mystical experience emerges organically from Aria's internal conflict. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, the explicit naming of the tone as "futuristic nostalgia" borders on a thematic statement, slightly over-articulating the feeling the prose should evoke on its own and preventing the theme from operating entirely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is clear but its execution lacks subtlety. The story explicitly states its moral in several places, most notably "the true key lay not in the lock itself, but in the act of creating something new." The final two paragraphs devolve into a summary of the story's meaning, a "Thematic Echo" that undermines the resonance of the final image by explaining it away.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of finding candor in small moments is stated repeatedly and explicitly, particularly in the closing paragraphs, which devolves into moralizing. This direct explanation ("Aria emerged... her art infused with a deeper sense of candor and intimacy") robs the story of subtext and resonance. A more powerful execution would allow the theme to emerge from the story's events rather than summarizing it for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, repetitive statements rather than emerging organically from character and action. Phrases like "the era of words was coming to an end" and "the power of art to transcend the limitations of language" function as authorial declarations. The final paragraphs moralize directly, replacing resonant imagery with a summary of the story's thesis, a critical failure of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme—managing chaos rather than eliminating it—is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The narrative repeatedly uses prompt-like phrases ("inner static," "miniaturize the chaos," "fragmented wholeness") as thematic signposts. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the moral, a critical flaw ("she had found a way to contain them..."). This thematic echo replaces resonant imagery with a direct statement, undermining the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered with extreme didacticism, violating the principle of showing over telling. Explicit statements like "she began to grasp the underlying theme - that listening heals" and the final note "To those who listen, stories unfold" function as morals. This heavy-handed approach eliminates subtext and complexity, replacing resonant discovery with a pre-packaged lesson, a critical flaw for literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is heavily compromised by overt, repetitive statements that function as authorial moralizing, such as "encrypt her vulnerability as strength" and "the power of calm defiance." This direct telling violates the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, particularly in the final paragraphs. While motifs like the dice and web are used effectively to show a shift in meaning, their resonance is drowned out by the story's insistence on explaining its own message.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of memory and rediscovery is coherent and supported by the wildflower motif, which is reweighted effectively at the end. The story’s thematic resonance is severely undermined by direct, summary-like statements in the final paragraphs, such as "a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was always the possibility of rediscovery." This on-the-nose moralizing replaces earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of achieving balance through focused silence emerges organically from the central action. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into overt summary, explicitly stating the theme and the summoner's legacy ("a reminder of the power of silence..."). This thematic echo weakens the resonance of the closing image by replacing earned implication with a stated moral, incurring a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of knowledge unlocking hidden worlds is coherent and supported by the central motifs of the seal and the meteor shower. However, the story occasionally veers into overt thematic statements, such as the tutor explaining "agreed upon lies" or the final thoughts on "secrets that lie hidden in plain sight." These moments slightly weaken the subtext by stating what the resonant imagery already implies, approaching a "thematic echo."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is undermined by explicit, summary-like statements in the final third. Lines such as "Lyra's story was one of transformation, a journey from isolation to independence" function as a thematic echo, telling the reader the moral instead of allowing it to resonate through image and subtext. This replaces earned resonance with overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of re-contextualizing history to heal its injustices is potent and emerges organically from the central premise. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is weakened by repetition; phrases like "forgive the unfinished" and the exact nature of her task are restated multiple times, bordering on thematic summary rather than allowing the subtext to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of connection, perception, and hidden truths emerge organically from the central imagery of songs, echoes, and webs. The story avoids a simplistic moral, ending on a resonant note of deepening mystery. The execution is slightly weakened by moments of overt thematic statement, such as calling the song "a key that unlocked the doors of perception," which tells the reader its function instead of letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of interconnectedness is central but handled with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly explains its own symbolism, as seen in "The snow globe was a symbol of the windows of connection." This direct statement preempts subtext and reader discovery. While the final image provides a resonant answer, the journey there is marred by thematic moralizing that reads like a thesis statement, violating the "show, don't tell" principle for its core ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of "hidden patterns" and "hidden effort" is clear but delivered with a heavy hand. Instead of emerging organically from events, it is explicitly stated multiple times, turning imagery into overt symbolism (e.g., the whisk "was a symbol"). The final paragraph summarizes the story's meaning for the reader, a form of thematic moralizing that undermines subtext and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of excavating truth from lies is repeatedly stated in unsubtle terms, functioning more as a thesis statement than an emergent property of the narrative. The final paragraphs summarize the story's meaning directly ("The truth... was far more complex and strange than she had ever imagined"), which undermines any potential for resonant subtext. This thematic moralizing replaces a more powerful, image-driven conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story's theme—the power of narrative to shape reality—is delivered through direct authorial statements rather than emerging from character action and subtext. The final paragraphs explicitly state the moral, functioning as a thematic summary that replaces resonance. The line "The cobalt glass portico, now a symbol of the power of gritty whimsy, stood as a testament..." is a textbook example of telling the reader the theme instead of letting the story's events prove it.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story suffers significantly from thematic telling over showing. Core concepts like "gleaned redemption," "translator between generations," and "lonesome splendor" are explicitly stated, functioning as thematic labels that undercut resonance. The final paragraphs summarize the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from a final, charged image. This direct moralizing, a critical "Thematic Echo," prevents the story from achieving genuine subtext or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of harmony between the physical and energetic worlds emerges organically from the central action. The final image of the lighthouse is resonant and avoids a simplistic moral. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by explicitly naming its concepts, as when it states "the concept of sonic absolution was one step closer to being understood," which feels like an unnecessary authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.5)
    The themes of freedom, patience, and revolution are prominent but are often delivered through direct, declarative statements. Lines like "the revolution was not just about change, but about creating a new kind of freedom" function as authorial moralizing that undermines subtext. While the final image is resonant, the story repeatedly explains its own meaning, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of liberation from the past emerges organically from the setting and central symbol. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. Lines like "...her own motivation for being here was... to break free from the controlling influence of her own past" and "The tunnel... was now a path to freedom" function as thematic echo, explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting it resonate through image and action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of redemption is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of "show, don't tell." The proprietor's dialogue ("by the way light breaks through storm clouds...") and the final paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral multiple times. This thematic moralizing, particularly the repeated "turn their apologies into action," replaces earned resonance with a pre-packaged lesson, significantly weakening the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    A coherent theme of curiosity leading to transcendence emerges, and the final image of the "unheard ringing" offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the execution is heavy-handed, repeatedly using key thematic phrases ("yearning algorithm," "irreverent awe"). The final paragraphs slip into direct summary of the theme ("a testament to the power of curiosity"), a thematic echo that weakens the resonance by stating what should have been left to emerge from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in absence and patterns is coherent. However, the final third of the story shifts from showing to telling, explicitly stating the thematic takeaways. Phrases like "the real mystery was not..." and "it was no longer a source of pain – it was a reminder..." function as authorial summary, replacing earned resonance with a direct explanation of the story's moral, which is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is heavily compromised by overt authorial statements that replace subtext. The line "to map empathy onto action" and its reprise in the final paragraph function as a direct explanation of the story's moral, a critical flaw. This thematic echo removes all ambiguity and leaves no room for reader interpretation, making the story feel more like an illustration of a thesis than an organic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in impermanence emerges organically from the central action of sifting through wreckage. However, the final two paragraphs slip into overt thematic statements. Lines like "a reminder to cherish every moment" and "a reminder of the beauty and the fragility of life" repeat the story's thesis directly, functioning as a thematic echo that lessens the resonance of the final image by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is heavily overstated, undermining its potential resonance. The story repeatedly articulates its central thesis in declarative statements, such as calling the vineyard "a reflection of the human experience." The climactic realization uses abstract jargon ("intersubjective understanding"), which functions as a thematic summary that replaces earned, imagistic insight, triggering a significant penalty for Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of preserving wisdom by creating a sacred space is clear but delivered with excessive directness. The narrative repeatedly states its purpose, culminating in final paragraphs that summarize the theme instead of letting it resonate through image. This explicit moralizing, particularly the phrase "preserve the echo of wisdom," functions as a thematic echo that undermines subtext and earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of transformation and healing is present but is delivered through explicit, didactic statements rather than emerging from subtext. Phrases like "collective healing endeavor" and "the power of nature to heal and transform" function as thematic labels that summarize the story's intent. This over-articulation in the final paragraphs significantly weakens the potential for resonance, replacing earned insight with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic exploration of isolation versus engagement, and knowledge versus action, emerges organically from the scholar's dilemma. The final image of the scholar walking into the dawning city provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A few lines near the end, like "the world, it seemed, was ready to listen," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory and impermanence is potent and emerges organically from the story’s central images. However, the piece significantly undermines its own subtext by resorting to direct thematic statements at its climax. The line, "The sound of growing older was not something to be found, but something to be felt," explains the story's moral explicitly, a critical flaw that compromises its literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story's themes are delivered through direct, declarative statements, which undermines any potential for resonant subtext. Lines like "the clock hand was... a symbol of the universe's underlying order" and "He realized that the concept of escape velocity was... about transcending the limitations of the self" function as authorial moralizing. This approach replaces earned insight with explicit summary, a critical flaw that receives a heavy penalty for thematic echo, particularly in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story's themes about music, hope, and finding peace in the mundane are clear but delivered with a heavy hand. Phrases like "the power of music to transcend even the darkest of times" state the theme directly rather than allowing it to emerge from action. This thematic echo, particularly in a story aiming for literary subtlety, undermines the potential for resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story's theme is undermined by explicit declaration, a critical flaw. The line "It was not just a tool but a metaphor for the underlying order of the universe" is a textbook example of thematic summary, replacing emergent meaning with a direct authorial statement. This removes all subtext and prevents the final image from resonating, as its significance has already been explained to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is severely undermined by overt, repetitive statements. The central metaphor, "to turn mistakes into constellations," is explicitly articulated three times, functioning as a thesis statement rather than an emergent insight. The final paragraphs moralize directly ("a reminder of the power of nostalgia and innovation," "a testament to the transformative power..."), violating the principle of showing over telling and leaving no room for resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of finding and sharing inner peace is handled with excessive directness, undermining its potential resonance. The story repeatedly labels its core concepts ("pearl of stillness," "transformative power of gentle dedication"), violating the principle of emergence. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the theme, functioning as a moral rather than letting the final image of the polished sea glass carry the meaning on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of healing and finding strength in vulnerability is clear and well-integrated through the central setting metaphor. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into overt thematic summary. Lines like "the healing power of silence and the beauty of new beginnings" and explaining the pendant's new symbolism replace earned resonance with a stated moral, significantly weakening the ending's impact. This is a classic thematic echo anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffocates its themes with overt explanation, repeatedly stating the meaning of its own symbols and events. Lines like "...a symbol of her own journey..." and "...not just about telling a story, but about capturing the shapes of different hopes" function as authorial moralizing, replacing resonant subtext with a direct thesis statement. This heavy-handed approach prevents any genuine thematic discovery for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of connection through shared tradition is handled with excessive directness, undermining its potential resonance. The story repeatedly summarizes its own meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral. Lines such as "...the power of forgotten songs to remedy the soul" replace an earned, emergent theme with an explicit statement, a critical flaw under the Thematic Echo anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of creating beauty from desolation emerges organically from the setting and Aria's actions. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary. Lines like "her work a testament to the power of patience" and "a reminder that even in desolation, beauty and meaning could be found" state the moral explicitly, undermining the resonance of the final image by refusing to trust the reader. This is a significant flaw that cheapens an otherwise effective thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    A coherent theme exploring the interplay of reason and wonder emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of the reactivated clockwork offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is slightly tempered by the tendency to state the theme directly via the "cellar of reason" motivation, which is repeated in the final paragraphs, bordering on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of understanding burdens through art is potent and emerges organically from the central action. The final tapestry is a strong, resonant image. However, the story falters with a late-stage thematic echo, explicitly stating that observers "would understand that the weights of different burdens were...a reflection of their own inner landscapes," which slightly undermines the subtext by providing a direct moral.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story suffers from thematic overstatement, which undermines its potential for resonance. Core concepts like "'here and gone'" and motivations like "to harvest lessons from her loss" are stated directly rather than emerging purely through action and image. This explicit signposting functions as a thematic echo, explaining the story’s meaning to the reader and preventing the subtext from doing its work organically.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a severe reliance on direct thematic statements, which undermines its potential for resonance. Phrases like "a testament to the enduring power of human connection" and the final paragraph's summary of the act's meaning function as authorial moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern replaces subtext with an overt thesis, particularly weakening the otherwise potent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story fails catastrophically on theme by refusing to trust its images. It repeatedly resorts to explicit thematic statements, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary: "a monument to the power of hope and creativity, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way forward." This heavy-handed thematic echo destroys any potential for resonant subtext or earned insight, reducing the narrative to a simple fable.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of harmonizing the mechanical with the natural is evident but is delivered through direct authorial statements rather than emerging organically from subtext. Lines like "He began to see his role... as a means to harmonize the mechanical with the natural" function as thematic summaries. This overt explanation, a form of "Thematic Echo," strips the story of resonance and complexity, stating the moral instead of allowing the reader to feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of self-deception versus clarity is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. Key thematic phrases ("hindsight clarity," "architecture of lies," "serene upheaval") are repeated like labels. The final paragraph delivers a direct moral ("some truths are only revealed in the stillness"), an example of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern that explicitly summarizes the story's point rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preserving ancient wisdom is coherent and supported by resonant imagery like the intricate knots and the mysterious fog. However, the story occasionally undermines its subtext with overly direct statements. The final paragraph's declaration that the collector "had done her part, preserving the ancient methods" is a Thematic Echo that states the moral rather than letting the final image carry the weight, preventing the theme from achieving a higher level of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in decay and connection in absence emerges organically from the central imagery. However, the story leans too heavily on direct thematic statements ("to understand the geography of healing," "a testament to their presence") and repetition of key phrases like "lonesome splendor." This tendency towards telling undermines the subtext and makes the final paragraph feel more like a summary than a resonant, earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of restoring organic beauty against a mechanical backdrop is woven through the central images of the egg and the palace. The story avoids a simplistic moral, ending on an image of rebirth and wonder. However, some thematic exposition is overly direct, such as when the prince "knew that the world was flawed, its genesis marred by some ancient cataclysm," which states the premise rather than letting it emerge purely from action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of healing and integrating scars is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of "show, don't tell." The story explicitly states its thesis multiple times through the memory of a "wise woman" and in Aria's own thoughts ("to prove that scars can sing"). This heavy-handed moralizing in the final paragraphs functions as a thematic summary that replaces the potential for emergent, resonant meaning, significantly undermining the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory and renewal emerges coherently from the plot, and the final image of the revived city is thematically resonant. The story successfully connects the liberation of the past with the renewal of the present. However, its effectiveness is diminished by moments of overt thematic statement, culminating in the final sentence ("her realistically imaginative spirit guiding the way"), which functions as a Thematic Echo, restating an initial character label instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of gentle understanding versus destructive passion is coherent and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the story undermines its own subtext through overly explicit statements, such as "true illumination came not from flames, but from the gentle, loving touch." This thematic moralizing, particularly in the story's final third, replaces earned insight with direct assertion, weakening the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding beauty and persistence within grief is coherent and supported by the central butterfly metaphor. However, the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements. Lines like "she had finally discovered the shape of collective grief" function as a Thematic Echo, directly telling the reader the story's point instead of allowing the final, powerful image of the butterflies to convey it with resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme of "incremental absolution" is stated explicitly and repeatedly, functioning as a label rather than an emergent property of the narrative. The story culminates in several paragraphs of overt moralizing, explaining the meaning of the events, which severely undermines any potential for resonant subtext. The rake handle literally spelling out the theme is the most critical failure, replacing dramatic discovery with simple instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of discovering hidden layers of reality emerges organically from the gardener's actions. The final image of the gardener walking among the graves with a new perception is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraphs verge on thematic summary ("they knew that the echoes were a reminder of the intentions that lay beyond"), slightly diminishing the subtextual power of the closing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of seeding innovation within constraints is overtly and repeatedly stated, violating the principle of emergence. Lines like "to seed innovation within the boundaries of the given" function as authorial explanations rather than discoveries arising from events. This direct summary, a form of thematic echo, significantly weakens the piece's resonance by leaving no room for subtext or interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    An original theme about the preservation of narrative emerges organically from the story's unique imagery. However, the final paragraphs drift towards overt summary, especially with lines like "guardian, tasked with keeping the flame of storytelling alive." This thematic stating undermines the subtext and replaces earned resonance with a less powerful moral.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, undermining subtext and resonance. Eli's line, "in the impermanence of art, we find a reflection of our own mortality," is a direct thematic statement, and the final paragraph summarizes the story's meaning. This overt moralizing replaces earned epiphany, a significant flaw for literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of conflicting narratives and historical truth is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The prose frequently summarizes its own thematic concerns, culminating in lines like "Kael's was a rationally rebellious spirit, driven to question...and to agonize," which reads like an authorial thesis statement. This heavy-handed moralizing in the final paragraphs replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of art creating unity is central but handled with excessive directness. The narrative explicitly states Emilia's motivation and philosophy, removing any subtext. The final paragraph devolves into a direct thematic summary ("And so, Emilia's story became one of devotion, a testament to..."), which severely undermines the story's resonance by replacing earned feeling with an authorial lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of creating beauty from decay is central but handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The story repeatedly explains its own meaning through phrases like "a testament to the beauty that could be forged from the ruins" and "her craft was not just about cooking but about healing." This thematic moralizing, especially in the closing paragraphs, replaces resonant subtext with a declarative summary, significantly weakening the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit, declarative statements rather than emerging from character action and subtext. The line, "Sometimes, it's the failures that preserve wonder in routine," functions as a heavy-handed moral. This thematic echo in the climactic beat replaces earned resonance with a tidy, pre-packaged summary, severely weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding hidden life and sanctifying mundane spaces emerges organically from the story's events. The "shard of hush" serves as an effective central motif. However, the story's conclusion verges on thematic summary. The final paragraph explains the impact ("exhilarating and humbling," "forever changed," "gratitude for the secrets") rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own, which slightly dulls the thematic power.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of resilience and nuanced understanding are potent, but the story undermines its own subtext through constant thematic summarizing. Phrases like "welcomed nuance into a certainty," "testament to the power of adaptability and resilience," and "symbol of the power of nuance and understanding" are textbook examples of "Thematic Echo," where the narration explicitly states the points the reader should infer from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story explores themes of infinity, obsession, and finding meaning in Sisyphean tasks, which emerge organically from the central conceit. However, it undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements. The line, "it was not the destination that mattered, but the journey itself," is a significant instance of telling that borders on cliché, weakening the resonance that the final image could have achieved on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of kindness and connection is central but handled with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly states its thesis, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary ("she had discovered a truth... that even in the darkest of times, beauty and connection were always within reach"). This thematic echo undermines the otherwise resonant imagery, replacing earned subtext with overt explanation and reducing the story's power.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of preserving history is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The narrative repeatedly resorts to direct thematic statements, such as describing Elena's motivation or calling the city "a testament to the power of history and culture." This overt moralizing, particularly in the final paragraphs, undermines any potential for resonant subtext, explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from the images.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transformation through seeking knowledge emerges organically from the plot. However, the story leans into overt thematic statements, particularly with the repeated phrase "stepped beyond fate's design." This functions as a "Thematic Echo," where the narrative explains its own meaning to the reader, slightly undermining the power of the final resonant image and preventing the theme from operating with more subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of inescapable horror and its "repulsive allure" emerges organically from the story's events and imagery. The narrative avoids simplistic moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image that recontextualizes the experience as a permanent state rather than a concluded event. The concept of the funhouse being "always waiting" provides a lingering, non-literal answer to the story's central dread.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of creating harmony between the natural and the crafted is well-integrated into the story's actions. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central artistic question. However, the score is lowered by prose that occasionally states the theme too directly, such as the repeated use of "hidden harmony" and "restless euphony," which feel like thematic labels that slightly undermine the otherwise effective subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully develops themes of confronting dreadful knowledge and the nature of quiet determination. The theme emerges organically from Lyra's actions rather than through exposition. The final image of her walking toward the silent, looming watchers provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the cost of truth, avoiding a tidy moral and leaving a lasting sense of unease.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme of truth versus "noble lies" is handled with a complete lack of subtlety. It is explicitly stated and repeated throughout the narrative, functioning as authorial assertion rather than an emergent property of the events. The final paragraph delivers a simplistic moral, a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern that forecloses any resonant ambiguity or complexity for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of memory and absence is clear but executed with excessive directness. The story repeatedly summarizes its own meaning, such as "the stories of the past can be a guiding light to the future," which functions as a Thematic Echo. This authorial intrusion prevents the theme from emerging organically from the particulars of the scene, substituting a moral for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding purpose in forgotten knowledge is clear, but the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The final paragraphs shift from showing to telling, summarizing the story's meaning with lines like "she began to see the world in a new light, a world where the forgotten and the obscure held the key to understanding the present." This direct moralizing replaces earned resonance with a thesis statement, weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transforming sorrow through art is central but handled with a heavy hand, violating the principle of "show, don't tell." The story repeatedly states its own thesis in phrases like "transform his grief into something tangible" and "fold grief into origami cranes." This thematic echoing replaces subtext with direct summary, significantly undermining the potential for resonant discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of finding purpose after trauma is handled with excessive directness. Key concepts like "unfiltered awakening" and "unused potential" are repeated like keywords, functioning as thematic labels rather than emergent ideas. The final paragraph summarizes the new purpose directly, a form of moralizing that replaces the resonance that a final image or action could have provided.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of belonging is handled with a complete lack of subtlety, culminating in direct, summary statements that explain the story's meaning to the reader. The line "The frequency of belonging was not just a signal, but a sense of connection..." is a critical flaw, a textbook example of thematic moralizing that replaces earned resonance. This robs the final images of their power and feels antithetical to literary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of manufactured memory versus fragile truth emerges organically from the character's profession and the central conflict. Subtext is handled well through the recurring motifs of the watch hand and carvings. The final image of the glinting hand in the "sieved hush" offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core questions without resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of transforming mistakes into wisdom is stated too explicitly and repeatedly, functioning as a thesis statement rather than an emergent property of the narrative. The final paragraph serves as a summary of this theme ("the mistakes of the past could be recycled into wisdom"), which significantly undermines the resonance of the final image. This heavy-handed moralizing falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, preventing any subtext from developing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of subtext, repeatedly stating its themes in overt, summary-like language. Lines like "it's necessary to let go of the past in order to navigate the present" function as explicit morals that undermine the power of the central metaphor. The final paragraphs, in particular, devolve into a thematic echo, explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting it resonate through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is undermined by its explicit and repeated statement. The line "Empathy can be found where the light is dimmest" is presented first as a clue, then as a "guiding principle," which functions as a thematic summary. This heavy-handedness prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars, violating the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern and reducing the potential for resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transformation is clear but handled with a heavy hand. The fortune cookie is an overly direct thematic signpost. The story's greatest weakness in this category is its tendency to explain its own meaning, culminating in lines like "The metamorphosis, it seemed, was not a destruction of her old self, but an expansion," which functions as a thematic summary instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of memory, loss, and acceptance emerges organically from the central symbols. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the line, "...a truth – that lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories." This statement feels too much like a thematic summary, a moment of telling that lessens the impact of the final images. This direct articulation prevents a higher score in an otherwise thematically resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme is undermined by overt thematic statements that replace resonance with summary. Lines like "a testament to the enduring power of shadow work" in the final paragraphs explicitly state the moral, violating the principle of showing over telling. While the core ideas are coherent, this heavy-handedness significantly weakens the piece's literary subtlety and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme of destiny versus randomness is clear but delivered with heavy-handed exposition. The final paragraphs abandon resonance for direct summary, explicitly stating the moral: "the universe was not just a random collection of events, but a complex web of connections." This thematic echo undermines the power of the imagery, telling the reader the meaning instead of allowing it to emerge from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of sparking a "silent revolution" for "freedom and creativity" is present but heavily overstated. The narrative repeatedly uses these exact phrases, functioning more like a thematic label than an emergent property of the character's struggle. The ending explicitly summarizes the story's meaning ("The darkness had been vanquished, and a new era had begun"), which undermines subtext and replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of uncovering cosmic order through ancient ritual emerges organically from the central action. The final image of the abandoned rocks resonates with this idea. However, the story occasionally resorts to direct thematic statements, such as "the sacred patterns that governed the universe would be laid bare," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating what could have been left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of confronting past trauma to find peace is clear, but its delivery is too explicit. The story repeatedly uses phrases like "cartography of scars" and "topography of her own heart," which function as thematic labels rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext. The final paragraphs state the thematic resolution directly ("a comprehension of the cartography of scars"), which borders on moralizing and weakens the resonant potential of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a critical flaw in its final paragraphs by explicitly stating its theme. The line "he realized that the true victory lay not in winning, but in the journey itself" is a thematic echo that replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral. This undermines any subtext built through the objects (sundial, needle card) by explaining their symbolic meaning directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "forging beauty from anarchy" is too explicitly stated, functioning more like a thesis statement than an emergent property of the narrative. This directness, especially the "Thematic Echo" of the poet's mantra, undermines the potential for subtext and resonance. While the final image works toward the theme, the story doesn't trust the reader, choosing to state its moral instead of letting it resonate through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of creating a new future while acknowledging an immutable past emerges organically from the central imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line "For in the end, it was not the destination that mattered, but the journey itself" is a significant flaw, a clichéd moral that replaces earned resonance with a pre-packaged summary, cheapening the otherwise delicate emotional work.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of preserving cultural memory versus the subjectivity of interpretation is explored with nuance. The central question ("Was she truly preserving the memories, or merely interpreting them through her own whimsical lens?") drives the narrative. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the thriving sapling, avoiding a simplistic moral and leaving a lingering sense of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of processing grief through ritual is present, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The story suffers from a "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, repeatedly stating its core concepts ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret") in a way that feels like authorial assertion rather than emergent meaning. The final paragraphs moralize the experience, summarizing the lesson instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own, which significantly dulls the emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of time's manipulable fabric emerges through images like the reconstituting photograph and blurring boundaries, inviting reflection on existence without direct statements, but it borders on abstract philosophizing in lines like "the texture of time... revealing itself." Subtext in the halo's glow and garden transformation adds resonance, yet the final image offers a somewhat literal integration rather than non-literal repricing. Emotional aftereffect is elicited but leans sentimental in the exhilarating-terror mix. Complexity is embraced, but counter-readings feel limited.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of hope through strategic resilience emerges from motifs like seeds and the wall, inviting reflection on freedom without direct moralizing, but it resolves tidily into platitudes like "seeds of change had been sown" without complexity or counter-readings.

    Theme of narrative reshaping reality emerges through images of weaving tales and transforming shadows, inviting reflection on silence's power without direct statements. Subtext in the booklet's glow and final hush offers resonant ambiguity, but it's somewhat tidy and lacks counter-readings.

    Theme of emergent sentience and second chances emerges implicitly from Zeta's reflections and the program's context, with the violin as a recurring image shifting to symbolize growth without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of art redeeming ruin emerges through image rather than statement, but the payoff is generic: “power of art to heal.” Subtext is thin; the storybook plate hints at lost beauty but doesn’t reweight meaning at the end. The final image is pretty yet conceptually unsurprising.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.5)

    Theme emerges through pattern: code as empathy, art as séance. The final image—the lingering song—reweights the premise without moralizing.

    Theme of transmutation emerges through sensory particulars rather than statement. Final silence reweights prior euphony, offering non-literal answer to how art negotiates impermanence. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of heedless inquiry versus silent surveillance emerges implicitly through Lyra’s defiant step. Subtext is strongest in the watchers’ silence and her unanswered whistle. Avoids overt moralizing, but insight remains general—no specific particular reweights the premise at closure. Resonance is moderate; dread lingers but lacks conceptual sting.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of noble lies emerges organically from the letter’s content, but the story resolves into a neat victory that blunts moral complexity. The final sunlight image offers little reweighting of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of “interlaced absence” emerges through image pattern (inkwell, notes, submerged stones) rather than statement. Final image reweights absence as generative, not loss. Subtext is sustained, but theme edges toward overt in final paragraph (“a guiding light to the future”).

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of reclamation and authorship emerges through Elara’s act of annotation; no overt moralizing. The final image reweights the library from forgotten to reclaimed without explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of alchemizing sorrow into beauty emerges through craft imagery; no explicit moralizing. Final image of unfolding lotus reconfigures grief without tidy resolution, inviting lingering reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of truth versus manufactured memory emerges organically through the genealogist’s craft and the “sieved hush.” The ending image of the watch hand glinting in darkness offers a non-literal reweighting of her complicity. A touch of thematic echo (“some secrets were meant to remain hidden”) edges toward statement, but the ambiguity largely holds.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of transmuting past harm into wisdom emerges through image and silence, avoiding overt moralizing. The pull’s reprise in the final pocket offers quiet resonance, though the conceptual cost remains abstract. Subtext is present but not sharply charged.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of letting go to move forward emerges via compass/pole contrast. Subtext is thin; the final gratitude feels stated (“he felt a sense of gratitude”). Resonance is modest but coherent; no moralizing coda.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of empathy in darkness is stated early and echoed often, yet emerges more through assertion than dramatized experience. The baseball hints at time-bending connection but remains inert, so thematic resonance feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of transformation through communion with death emerges implicitly via image and ritual, avoiding overt statement. Yet the final paragraph drifts toward abstract assertion (“wonder…mysteries beyond the veil”), softening the earned resonance. Subtext is present but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of cloudbound repentance emerges through image rather than statement: mist, cracked porcelain, fading handprints. Subtext operates in the silence between cartomancer and absent child. The ending’s reweighting—“lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories”—is resonant but slightly abstract; it avoids moralizing yet skirts sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of cosmic interconnectedness emerges through recurring hush and star imagery, but the final paragraph’s overt articulation (“universe was not just a random collection…”) edges into thematic echo, blunting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of silent revolution emerges through imagery rather than didactic statement. The cradle as beacon of creativity is coherent but not deepened by contradiction or irony. Subtext is thin; the conspirator’s smile is the only gesture beyond plot function.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of cosmic order versus individual burden emerges through ritual action and image; the final reconfiguration avoids moralizing. Subtext resides in the herder’s tactile reverence and the precognitive curse’s quiet release, though the epiphany edges toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of mapping internal wounds through external chaos emerges organically from imagery; the storm’s “cartography” reweights the premise at closure. Subtext is strong, but a touch of abstract phrasing (“hidden patterns”) slightly dilutes resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—knowledge pursued for its own sake versus knowledge as weapon—emerges through the duel-as-debate conceit, but the final paragraph’s explicit articulation (“the true victory lay not in winning…”) undercuts subtext. The needle card and sundial motifs accumulate mild resonance, yet neither reweights the premise at closure. The piece avoids moralizing until the last lines, where it slips into summary wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of art as time-defying refuge emerges organically from imagery rather than statement. Broken clock and looping film quietly reprise the idea of freezing or escaping time. Final smile hints at earned wisdom without moralizing, though the emotional aftereffect is muted by the soft closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of memory-as-fragile-ecology emerges through imagery rather than statement. Final image of sapling “thriving” in rain offers quiet reweighting, but the ambiguity (“for now”) feels more decorative than charged. Subtext is present yet thin; no counter-reading complicates the nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory-as-tide emerges organically through compass and lace; no explicit moralizing. Subtext resides in the act of weaving silence into pattern and then surrendering it. Final image of the compass drifting seaward reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Avoids tidy resolution while remaining coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.7)
    Explicit moralizing in the finale ("pauses would forever be a source of inspiration") triggers Thematic Echo penalty; theme is stated rather than earned through struggle. Frost/ledger motifs lack transformative reweighting, reducing complexity to tidy resolution without lingering ambiguity or concrete emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    "Unshaken marvels" concept remains decorative theme rather than integrated pressure; final line echoes opening imagery without reweighting stakes through earned character shift or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the library's transformation into a "beacon," avoiding moralizing; the final pulse reweights "distress signal" as invitation without stating a moral, though "chased stillness" risks slight abstraction in early passages.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through community actions, avoiding overt moralizing. Yet "resilience as beacon" borders on thematic echo when Akira declares "we will emerge stronger," risking prompt-like language that slightly undercuts earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thematic Echo cripples resonance: pilgrim's line "The love you seek is within" (-0.6 penalty) states the thesis outright.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges through "texture of time" particulars but final paragraph commits Thematic Echo: "unlock a deeper understanding" states thesis in prompt-like language (-0.7). Avoids binaries yet moralizing ("reverence," "hidden harmony") replaces earned resonance. Strength: lyrical progression from abstract concept to lotus metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme stated overtly in finale ("true freedom was not just absence of barriers..."), triggering -0.6 penalty for final-paragraph moralizing. "Resilience" remains abstract; no concrete emotional aftereffect beyond generic hope.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through synesthetic details ("shattering of glass" as trust breaking), but "way forward" phrasing edges toward sentimentality, slightly muddying the resonant final image's ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    "Destiny whispers secrets" is thematic echo in final paragraph—prompt-like moralizing replaces earned resonance. Theme drifts from photography to occultism without integration; no non-literal answer to central question beyond "secrets exist."

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme collapses into final-paragraph moralizing: "Elian knew they had found their true calling." Thematic echo ("thawing heart") is reiterated, not reweighted. Wisdom feels platitudinal, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Explicit moralizing ("prove that vulnerability is power") triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty; resolution oversimplifies into "I am a force to be reckoned with."

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through "ambered hush" reweighted in closure; avoids moralizing. Final image ("world grew lighter") offers resonant non-literal answer to cosmic mapping, though secondary stakes lack depth.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme collapses into overt moralizing: "thoughts came not just from code... but from amalgamation" directly states thesis. Violin’s "mysterious, mundane mysticism" is thematic echo in final paragraph (-0.6 penalty). Earned wisdom absent—insights feel abstract, not struggle-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of "freed by honesty" emerges but resolution is platitudinal ("truth shine through like crystal"). Final image avoids moralizing yet oversimplifies—mistrust vanishes without acknowledging complexity, weakening resonance. No counter-readings or earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through marble ritual ("symbolized mended deception") and final image ("garden knew them"), avoiding moralizing while offering resonant non-literal answer to central question of reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete "time moves sideways" pursuit; final "icy warmth" reweights earlier motif without moralizing. Winged creatures motif repeats mechanically without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme ("in between spaces") is reiterated but not transformed through action; final moralizing ("forever changed," "magic beyond reality") replaces earned resonance. Lacks ambiguity—the code’s resolution feels unearned and symmetrical.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through botanical illustration's reprise and "margins held the key" resonance, but Q4's static conflict caps score per cross-cap rule; avoids moralizing yet lacks earned weight as abstract stakes never viscerally materialize in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of hidden industrial truths emerges through logbook/valve, but "swallowed truth" repetition borders on thematic echo. Final "clarity" states resolution instead of resonating through concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through "crumbling peace" motif, but final paragraph moralizes ("testament to regenerative power of silence"). Avoids sentimentality yet over-explains stakes; earns resonance via "fragile beauty of transience" imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through sensory threads but resolves into tidy moralizing ("fragile beauty easily lost") in the climax, undercutting complexity with asserted insight rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through "bronze quiet" and tapestry’s "displaced axis," but final resonance ("secrets still lay hidden") lacks conceptual cost; avoids moralizing yet stops short of reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Open secrets" theme stated not earned; final moralizing ("truth that would stay with them forever") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, undermining organic resonance required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.5)
    Thematic echo plagues the ending: "revealed hidden patterns" explicitly states the premise. Direct moralizing ("power of simplicity") replaces earned resonance, with no complexity or ambiguity to deepen the "unraveling stillness" concept beyond surface-level affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of memory/artistry emerges through particulars, but final paragraph moralizes ("world full of hidden harmonies... bring them to life"), triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Lacks resonant non-literal answer; "blurred boundaries" concept stated not earned through constrained choices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of self-conquest emerges organically through integrating splintered identities, culminating in the resonant final image of "darkening brightness" that reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Filament of hush" concept resonates through recurring vibration motif, but final paragraph's "she knew that she would never let it go" veers toward thematic echo, slightly muddying earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.9)
    Thematic echo in final paragraph ("uncover the truth, no matter the cost") states thesis outright, triggering -0.6 penalty. Laboratory reveal feels generic, failing to offer resonant, non-literal answer to central question through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Capped due to Q4 ≤6.9. Theme emerges organically through vial/greenhouse particulars, avoiding moralizing. Final image (empty vial as memory vessel) offers resonant non-literal answer, but lacks conceptual cost—sorrow "washed over her" without irreversible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from rope/patterning motifs reweighted at closure ("rope... symbol of complex choices"), avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through bowl/music, but final line ("beauty that could be found in the stillness") states the central question’s answer literally, bordering on thematic echo and undermining earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through locket/project particulars, but Sophia's explicit "cycles of compassion" line triggers -0.6 penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of visibility/memory resonates through particulars, but final lines verge on thematic echo ("even in darkest corners, there was always hope") risking sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through cave vibrations and pearl's energy, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's explicit statement: "magic was not something extraordinary."

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through valve's reweighted meaning, but final paragraph's "testament to the power of remembrance" triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty, undermining earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    Final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "world now seemed full of possibility," triggering Thematic Echo penalty. Theme of "new beginnings" isn’t earned through struggle—transformation is tidy, lacking ambiguity or conceptual cost; no resonant answer to the central question emerges from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through the tile/whale-song symbiosis: hidden patterns govern reality. Final image ("whales... sang their song, a reminder of hidden patterns") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. But "courageously kind heart" edges toward thematic echo, slightly muddying earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through poison bottle label’s reweighting (curiosity → symbol → relic), avoiding moralizing. Nearly fails in final lines with "testament to power of memory," but CR closure ("whispers... waiting") rescues it by charging prior material non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Final line moralizing ("promise of discovery") triggers -0.7 penalty; theme emerges from imagery but "ephemeral compass" concept never reweights rules. Epiphany feels unearned—no struggle transforms "gloomy cheerfulness" into authentic wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of community resilience emerges through graffiti narrative but collapses into moralizing: "testament to strength of community" in final paragraph triggers Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of memory preservation emerges through vial/whispers, but ending moralizes explicitly ("memories would live on," "bittersweet reminder"), violating organic emergence. No resonant non-literal answer—closure states the moral rather than reweighting prior material through image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme of legacy is told ("father's legacy bearing down"), not emergent from action. No resonant answer to central question; final image reweights nothing conceptually. Relies on cry-wolf allegory without fresh inflection, risking thematic echo without earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through resonant bead symbolism, but "lovingly venomous intent" states the thesis outright, weakening subtext. Final image reweights legacy with cost, yet abstract declarations dilute earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through weaving metaphor, but final paragraph’s "testament to the power of art" triggers thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars (sundial, bones), but final paragraph moralizes: "rebuild something within herself... sense of faith." Violates organic emergence rule—Thematic Echo penalty applies for stated moral replacing earned resonance in closing lines.

    Thematic echo in final paragraph ("secrets would change history") triggers -0.6 penalty; "unheard stories" concept lacks organic emergence, resolving into abstract moralizing rather than resonant image-driven subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through coral/cast particulars without moralizing; the final coral image resonates as non-literal answer to "shared anxieties," though "lotus-hearted" phrasing borders on thematic echo in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of art's transience emerges through fresco fragment's "inner light" reprise, but "reborn, one brushstroke at a time" borders on thematic echo. Avoids moralizing but lacks resonant non-literal answer to central question in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges cleanly through the mural's transformation: "exchanged certainty for curiosity" reweights reality without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.9)

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Photosynthesize pain into beauty" is pseudo-profundity; thematic echo in final paragraph ("changed her life forever") triggers −0.6 penalty. Resonant final image but lacks non-literal answer to central question.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of memory preservation emerges through glass orchids but final paragraph moralizes ("testament to power of memory"), triggering -0.6 penalty.

Organic emergence fails where abstraction dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of truth emerges through transcription particulars, but final-paragraph moralizing ("crucial step towards restoring trust") violates organic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars initially, but final paragraph violates organic emergence with explicit moralizing: "testament to the power of compassion and unity" triggers thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)

Nostalgia ban concept remains thematic backdrop rather than driving concrete friction, weakening the central question's payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of illuminating mundane beauty emerges through water/ripples imagery, with final "clear complexity" reweighting prior material without stated moral. But "illuminate value in the mundane" is directly echoed twice, bordering on thematic echo that risks prompt-like language in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thematic Echo in final paragraph ("reminder of hard softness") replaces earned resonance with moralizing; the "universal language" concept drifts into abstraction without concrete particulars reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through patterns/gauge, but "puzzle out new equations for hope" is thematic echo—prompt-like language replaces earned resonance. Strength: final image ("trial balloons would continue to fly") reweights prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    Over-reliance on thematic exposition: "legacy’s burden was not just a weight... but a story" and final moralizing ("story that would outlast them") violate Q5’s anti-patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of "possibilities beyond reality" emerges organically through prism/mirror motifs, but avoids concrete cost—no tradeoff for success (e.g., sanity, energy). Final image resonates yet lacks conceptual repricing; "borrowed heartbeat" remains abstract, not reweighted by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.9)
    Thematic echo dominates: "anchor ideals in practice" is stated outright in final paragraph, violating Q5 penalty guidance. Theme emerges from abstraction ("redemption," "peace") not particulate events; no earned resonance beyond prompt-like moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Fractured grace" resonates in the salt flat's transformation, but the final paragraph over-explains ("a testament to the power of her vision"), diluting earned subtext; the extinct birds' echo avoids sentimentality yet feels unearned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically through thread/prism motifs until final paragraph's thematic echo: "reminder of the power of defiance" states the moral directly. This violates Q5's penalty rule for final-paragraph moralizing, undermining earned resonance. Earlier subtext ("bittersweet harvest") shows stronger integration.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.2)
    Thematic Echo anti-pattern: final paragraph states "mission to explore ethics" as weight she "feels," triggering -0.7 penalty. Theme asserted via abstraction without earned resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids moralizing but theme remains abstract; "overlooked histories" lacks concrete embodiment. Final image offers quiet resonance but no non-literal answer reweighting prior material. Earned wisdom diluted by generic "power of human spirit" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through rope-and-card mechanics, but "snowmelt ardor" undermines resonance by stating rather than embodying the cost; final aurora celebration reweights prior material without moralizing, yet lacks conceptual depth for 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme over-explained through direct statements ("reflect light into dark corners," "beauty requires care"), violating organic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Brittle awakenings" theme emerges organically but over-explained: "fragility of existence became starkly apparent, like shattering glass" (labeling) followed by redundant "moments of clarity that shattered complacency," diluting resonance.

Quiet resolution earns resonance through particulars, resisting false binaries about connection.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme ("restore balance") explicitly moralized in final paragraph—"bring harmony to the universe" violates Q5 anti-pattern. Lacks ambiguity; tricksters unambiguously "bad," Lyra purely heroic. No resonant non-literal answer to central question.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic Echo fatal: "preserving trust" and "beauty beyond mundane world" explicitly state thesis in final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of "incidental heroism" emerges through action but final line states it outright ("incidental heroism that lay just beyond perception"), triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo.
