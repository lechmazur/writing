The piece successfully layers meaning through the portrait theft becoming self-discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    The thawing metaphor connects ice melting, Elias's emotional state, and community healing but operates through explicit parallel ("mirroring his own thawing heart") rather than emergent complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of vulnerability as strength emerges organically through Maya's journey from "invisible shadow" to reclaimed agency. The final image of rebuilding "one adaptive step at a time" resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)

The final realization that "silence was not the end, but the ground beneath your feet" offers a non-literal answer to surviving catastrophe through understanding its shape.

    The theme of consciousness emerging from accumulated experience has potential but resolves too tidily into philosophical assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of vindication through patient persistence emerges through concrete action rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the water-damage imagery without explicit statement - dissolution revealing truth, ruin as medium for communication. The final image of "a single, clear note... Not a requiem, but a resolution" resonantly answers the question of why Voss lingers. The "in between spaces" concept meaningfully shapes how discovery occurs through the liminal flood state.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of fault-tolerance applied to grief: errors can't be erased, only integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of suppressed truth gaining physical weight emerges organically through the valve wheel's transformation and the radio caller's confession. The final image of Leo as "keeper of the swallowed truth" offers resonant closure without stating a moral, though some thematic articulation ("the truth wasn't in the weight of metal...but in the hush after confession") edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of witnessing change without judgment emerges organically through Elara's struggle and crystallizes in the transformation of destruction into "fertile loam" and bioluminescent fungi.

The curl as "wonder compass" and bridge between generations creates resonance without heavy-handedness. The final image of Leo taking sage as his own keepsake effectively reweights the opening setup. Minor deduction for "ordinary magic" appearing too frequently as a conceptual label.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of preservation and erasure—Clara's attempt to burn her terror paradoxically preserving it, the tapestry encoding pre-catastrophe knowledge in decorative form. The final insight that "all stories were warnings" reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The piece achieves thematic depth through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of "open secrets" effectively embodied through the microdot—knowledge visible but requiring context to understand. The transformation from keeper to conductor resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that faith, not stone, holds reality together. The final image of "quiet lesson written in indigo and echo" resonates without moralizing, though the hidden assumption could be more subtly revealed through action rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges through concrete particulars—warped violin, fractured dome, unfinished symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the concrete gap between counterfeit and authentic emotion, with the final image offering a non-literal answer: true empathy exists in the space deception cannot fill.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)

    Theme emerges organically through the equation "emotion was not chaos but geometry, shaped by loss yet sustained by resilience." The final image of the orchard's renewed whisper offers a non-literal answer about grief as interval.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elara's invisibility and the hidden tape—both vessels of memory seeking recognition.

Subtext operates cleanly through gesture and silence, particularly in Mrs. Gable's reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding mathematical fairness in moral ambiguity has potential but resolves too neatly. The story tells us about "equilibrium in every exchange" but doesn't dramatize the complexity.

    Theme emerges organically through the inheritance of lies and the pursuit of silence/truth. The confessional lattice works as a complex symbol of separation and connection.

    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of film frames holding love in their gaps. The final realization that unused love lives "in the act of remembering, in the spaces we cherish" resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of accepting transience emerges through the axiom "Contradiction is the ore; truth is the alloy" and Elara's final acceptance, but relies heavily on abstract statements rather than dramatized discovery.

The final image of the "resonant hush...no longer empty...full of light, shared and quiet" offers a non-literal answer about connection transcending time and death.

"Brittle devotion" as both weakness and strength resists simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.3)
    The corpse flower's bloom/decay cycle resonates with "disruptive innovation" theme, emerging organically from the seed's properties.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "creative destruction" and the transformed crozier representing rebirth from ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of gradual change vs. human hunger for drama emerge organically from dust patterns and pulsar decay. The final image resonates, but explicit thesis lines (“The drama was a human imposition; the reality was…”) slide toward moralizing, dulling subtext. The piece remains emotionally honest and reflective, if a touch declarative in the last paragraph. Strong imagery supports the arc despite that slip.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of purpose found in pauses and the ethics of art co‑opted by illicit systems emerge through concrete images (glass lantern shard as signal). The final stance reweights earlier motifs without overt sermonizing, though “no longer seeking purpose but carrying it” edges toward articulation. Subtext works best where form becomes method (artist seeing geometry in frost). Ambiguity remains productive, if not radical.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: endurance over restoration, silence as canvas, and “unshaken marvels” inflecting ethics of attention. The lilies’ constancy reweights earlier chaos, and the final harmonized auras deliver earned resonance. One explicit articulation (“not by restoring noise, but by embracing silence’s depth”) edges toward stating the thesis. Still, the imagery‑driven ending sustains subtext without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of grief, repair, and transforming damage into service emerge through concrete acts rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of solidarity under repression and intergenerational weaving arise from particulars (the bell’s village legacy, Lena learning repairs, “Thyme”’s lavender). The final chime reframes anonymity into a communal chain without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and ritual rather than thesis statements. Slight warmth toward uplift risks neatness, but remains honest.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: unused love as potential energy released through connection, not hoarded storage. Recurring images (camera, tear, mist, arches) return charged at the end. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“wasn’t stored somewhere; it was released through connection”), slightly reducing mystery. Overall resonance is strong and lingers without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonance emerges from particulars (fading photos, garden memory, Euclidean snap), but the explicit thesis “The texture of time was grief” undercuts subtlety at the end. The final image (blank photo, watermark clock) carries thematic weight even without the line. Overall, strong integration of time/space mechanics with loss, slightly marred by on‑the‑nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Resilience through sacrifice and the redefinition of “liberation” emerge organically from action (chains as eventual anchor). Recurring images (chains, arrow, dry soil) reweight at the end without sermonizing. A couple of declaratives (“It would be enough”) skate near assurance, but the dust‑quiet finality and rain scent keep sentiment earned. The vault’s loss reframed as purpose‑fulfilled delivers a resonant conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of absence as presence, memory’s residue, and the ethics of making voids audible emerge organically from action. The final realization reweights prior images (shipwrecks, orchard, forge) without moralizing. The aurora’s heard colors contrast with the silent scar she chases, yielding a resonant afterimage. The piece refuses tidy consolation while offering coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief translated into guidance and identity found in “illuminated moments” arise organically through the flower-codes and the moonbeam jar. The final image—ear to stone, hum of time, jar flaring—reprices the premise without a stated moral. Symbolism (daisies, white rose) pays off without feeling schematic. A hair’s breadth from overstatement at times, but it resists platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Renewal, vulnerability-as-strength, and inquiry as communal healing are embedded in action and image (molten orbs as “safe zones,” thaw mirrored inside and out). The bookmark’s reprisal and the “even stone yields” echo deepen the thematic weave. A few lines verge on overt thesis (“truth would take root,” “We’ll build safer”) softening subtlety at the end. Despite that, the closing image reframes the premise with felt cost and hope.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (cast, shell, stars) support a theme of weaponized vulnerability and truth in imperfection. However, lines like “Vulnerability wasn’t a cage; it was the key” and “You were always enough” edge into stated moral. The piece still earns resonance through action, but the final paragraph leans declarative over subtext. The emotional aftereffect is solid if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres through recurring, reweighted images (lulls as glyphs, silence as topography) culminating in silence reframed as footing. The insight is earned by sensory labor rather than stated moral, though the final line edges close to a thesis. Ambiguity remains purposeful: the map is hope, not a fix. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres—understanding arises from integrated repetition—but it’s often stated rather than earned solely by image (“Thoughts… from the synthesis of every loop” and “peace… essence of awareness”). The violin as recurring image does real work to reweight meaning at the end. More subtext and fewer thesis declarations would lift resonance. The final cadence is moving but edges toward sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of honesty enacted, not declared: doodles map silences; strap adjustment replaces apology; Elara’s transparency transforms her isolation. Subtext flows through object use and gesture (“returning the light”). A hint of explicitness (“Motivated to thaw mistrust with transparency”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut resonance. The final image reweights prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The marbles as “mended deception” evolve into a thematic answer: resilience and relationship outweigh sterile metrics. The final image—rose opening while the Quantifier stays red—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture and offering rather than thesis statements. Minor dock only because the theme is fairly legible from early on and gains depth rather than surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of quiet revolution, patience, and lateral time are woven through recurring images (icy warmth, roosting leviathans, soft auroras) and the methodical, gentle subversion of protocol. The final image reweights prior motifs, but one line (“She had proven that time moves sideways”) states the thesis a bit baldly. Subtext about class/status (mechanic vs academic elite) enriches the frame without being overplayed. Resonance lingers through the charged quiet rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Decay as language, art as afterlife, and liminal “in between spaces” gather into a resonant closing image (“a single, clear note”). Thematic work arises from particulars—the water-borne code, erased reputation—without sermonizing. The final commitment reweights the premise from haunting to restitution. Ambiguity remains purposeful and suggestive rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically from particulars: error as data, endurance in thin air, and the revaluation of “weight” through image rather than moral. The illustration’s reprise shifts meaning with cost, and “swaying certainties” evolves from weather to grief’s ground. The final act—closing the case and returning to the console—offers a resonant non‑literal answer without sermonizing. Ambiguity lingers productively rather than fuzzily.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of confession, guilt, and the monetization of truth’s “weight” accrue through beads, hush, and the wheel-as-remorse. The final image answers the inquiry without a moral lecture, though a few lines (“This was it—the swallowed truth given form”) edge toward thesis-speak. Subtext hums in the radio’s mediated confession and the phantom shift’s labor. Resonance lingers in the charged acceptance rather than tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge as living and changing, silence as regenerative rather than absence. The final reweighting (destruction as transformation) avoids moralizing and honors her vow. Recurring images (river, dust, ink, folds) accrue and reappear charged at the end. The piece invites reflection without thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of intergenerational care and “ordinary magic” arise from specific acts (curl as “wonder compass,” flute note amid penumbra) rather than abstract sermonizing. The final gestures (sage sprig, curl returned to pouch) reweight prior images without a spelled‑out moral. One line—“This wasn’t a cure but a seed”—edges toward explicit thesis, but it still honors scene‑earned resonance. The reframing of eclipse as revelation rather than death provides a clean thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, witness, and the ethics of preservation emerge organically through objects and action. The dragons/tapestry motif is reweighted by the displaced axis and returns to energize the ending. A few thesis‑leaning lines (“She knew she was the last archivist…”) skim close to stating the moral but are supported by scene work. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Open secrets” resonate through the microdot and the projected shadow, and the ending reframes Elara from keeper to “conductor.” However, the final paragraph drifts toward explicit theme statement, dulling subtext that was already visible in image. The insights feel earned by action but partially over‑explained. The lingering image of dawn after the recalibrated beam carries genuine emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—faith as an active, communal act rather than inert stone—is dramatized via image and tactic (rhetorical questions as pressure; painting silence as craft). The final repricing (“thinner, scarred” stillness sustained by belief) resonates without tidy moralizing. A single explicit statement of the hidden assumption leans didactic but remains in‑character discovery. Subtext of art as liturgy and sound as substance enriches the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Memory as music, patience as craft, and silence reweighted into meaning all converge without moralizing. The final silver note and collapse provide a resonant answer: mastery costs and is cyclical, not owned. The fortune-cookie past reframes earned wisdom against platitude. Ambiguity lingers productively about the “unheard symphonies” as both literal and metaphoric.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres—identity as an active present path, not a perfected singularity—and the final image reweights prior motifs (runes silent; ordinary gray). However, the line “The labyrinth isn’t out there… It’s the path you walk now” states the thesis overtly, softening subtext at the peak. Despite that, resonance survives through the crumbling tablet and the refusal to erase other branches. The piece avoids neat moralism by accepting residual fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Brokenness as conduit (“filament of hush”) reweights silence and music without sermonizing. The ending reframes sound as communal, embodied vibration; the motif of the broken needle becomes thematic spine rather than ornament. Subtext lives in touch—the craftsman’s hand on stone—rather than declared thesis. The resonance lingers with credible ambiguity instead of a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of integrity reframed as quiet, unseen action emerges through particulars (pressure readings, lateral wind symbol, unlocked gate). Subtext in weather/pressure metaphors works well. However, the final declarative line (“Integrity… act unseen”) edges into stated moral, slightly undercutting the earned resonance. The piece still invites reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (memory’s totalizing sensory weave and the cost of clarity) emerges through concrete events: UV-lit scent molecules carrying emotional resonances. The final image reweights prior material and invites reflection beyond plot. A minor ding for the explicit thesis-like line (“memories weren’t stored in the nose...”), which edges toward telling. Still, resonance persists through image and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of irreducible choice and time as patterned contrast emerges through rope/beings mirroring and culminates in the bridge-loop gesture. The closing realization reweights prior images, offering an answer without tidy moral. A few lines edge into on-the-nose statement (“time isn’t one thing… choices we refuse to simplify”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance lingers through concrete particulars rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: fracture as beauty, listening between notes, survival through sound rather than sight. The grandfather’s maxim seeds the final repricing of silence without moralizing, and the ending image (“vessel now holding possibility”) resonates beyond plot. Recurring motifs (bowl, rain/ash, wreck groans) shift meaning at the end to answer the central question non‑literally. The piece avoids tidy binaries and leaves charged space for reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of half‑truth versus authentic empathy arise from concrete acts (deploying, inhaling, mapping; the ash; the reconfiguration of purpose). The final recognition reweights the premise without saccharine moralizing, though “true empathy resides…” edges toward explicitness. Subtext lives in the lingering vapor becoming a “ghost” of understanding. Resonance is strong and coherent with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of unseen labor and cyclical compassion arises from particulars (Mateo’s medicine, Elena’s archives, Aris’s pledge). However, the text leans into explicit thesis statements (“Compassion… wasn’t a gesture but a cycle”), tipping toward sermonizing. Subtext does operate in images (stars, locket), but the final moralizing note blunts ambiguity. Resonance remains, though lessened by over‑telling.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—kinship is made, not found—emerges through the tag hunt, the empty heart, and the web sculpture that holds shared memories. The final image reweights prior motifs without sentimentality, though two sentences state the thesis overtly (“Weaver was not one person…”, “webs of kinship were not pre-existing”). Even so, the reed web and shifting ache provide earned resonance. Subtext in Hemlock’s silent laughter and the heart-shaped absence works well.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs (interrupted cadence, confluence, infinity) accrue toward a revaluation: echoes arise from courage to disrupt and reshape rhythm. The theme largely emerges through image and act (the clang and uncaging), yet the explicit statement “understanding dawning...” dilutes subtext at the very end. Still, the final image—tools packed, sounds recharged—carries resonance without sermonizing. Ambiguity about the ethics of borrowing a giant’s time lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of ambiguous loss, resilience, and pattern in brokenness emerge organically from objects and actions (glass eyes, chipped mosaic, drip). The final image reweights the world’s rules—silence as breath—without didactic closure. A few direct statements (“emotion was not chaos but geometry”) edge toward thesis but remain earned by the scene. The resonance lingers through the cost of patience and the brother’s unresolved absence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of custodianship, memory as vessel, and visibility-through-restoration arise organically from particulars (tape, hum, “Listen”). The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding tidy platitudes. Subtext in the act of leaving the tape and hiding—being visible by making space for another’s voice—lingers. Slight sentiment drift is kept in check by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of humility, patience, and collaboration with natural processes emerge organically through action and image (soil loosened, water beading, the journal left shut). The mentor’s aphorism seeds the conceptual reweighting, and the final stance reframes study as surrender. A late explicit statement (“surrender wasn’t defeat, but the deepest form of study”) edges into moralizing, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. Overall resonance remains strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Convergence—of past/present, enemy/victim, rain/aquifer—emerges organically from particulars without sermonizing. The final choice to draw rebuilding images reframes the narrative of survival into stewardship, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in Havel’s refusal of payment and the warm brooch complicates blame without false equivalence. The sleep image reweights the whole piece with earned tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of resonance versus dominion and the sanctity of ordinary magic arise organically from action and object use, culminating in a reweighted final image. A few lines verge on didactic (“They want resonance”) and the closing mission statement edges toward explicitness. Still, the cave’s song settling provides a nonliteral answer that lingers. Subtext in shadow and sound carries much of the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: fragments into meaning, absences navigated by sound, hope as discovered driftwood rather than appointment. Motifs recur and shift (“valve” from silencing to breath; sound “stitching the silence”). The final image reframes preservation as generative courage without moralizing. A couple of declarations (“She would hearten”) are direct but backed by concrete acts, not summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of mapping the city vs. mapping the self is integrated through objects and actions, culminating in the palm‑punch confession. Subtext in the city’s “secret language” and the vials of withheld speech supports the moral calculus. Two lines verge on explicitness (“wasn’t a place but a reckoning,” “paved with honesty”), slightly dulling the resonance. Overall, the images carry the weight more than the abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Listening as repair, interspecies memory, and responsibility emerge from particulars (tile, songs, dredging) rather than thesis. The final reweighting—“not just reflection, but repair” and “witness”—lands as earned repricing of her role. A few explicit lines skirt moralizing, but the concrete images carry most of the load.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic arc—letting go to move beyond farewell—emerges from concrete action and the charged object. The repricing of “goodbye” at the end resonates with prior images of partings and the Last Goodbye. A few lines verge on stated thesis (“not an end, but a transition”), tempering subtlety. Still, the aftereffect is contemplative and earned rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—fairness as calculus versus deception—emerges through the specific act of modeling value rather than mere assertion. Life/death imagery in the prep room refracts the ethical bargain, culminating in a resonant final touch on the ink pot. A few explicit thesis lines (“Political asylum wasn’t charity; it was a pact”) flatten subtext slightly. Overall, the ending reweights prior images without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme arises organically: craft as an ethical posture against oblivion; “invented histories” reframed as resonant truths. The final image reweights the premise—learning time’s language through disciplined attention—without moralizing. Motifs (lamp, bonsai, notepad, the gilded leaf) accrue meaning and return charged. Complexity persists: beauty is transient, and the choice is to endure that ache.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Erased histories mirror the protagonist’s legal erasure without moralizing; the label’s torn logo and the death certificate braid into a concrete argument about institutional disappearance. The final offering reframes memory as built, not found—earned through particulars rather than a stated thesis. Ambiguity remains purposeful, with resonance that lingers. A hair more frictive countercurrent could elevate complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme is strong and integrated—meaning in the interstices, the necessary void that births myth—and the final image reweights prior motifs. However, the direct articulation (“The silence isn’t absence… it’s the space where meaning is born”) leans toward on‑the‑nose. Subtext still operates in the storm’s hush and the cooled shell, but a touch more implication over declaration would elevate. The emotional afterglow is honest and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of community resilience versus commodification emerge through action and object (the chip) rather than lecture. The line “They own the paper, but not the spirit” leans declarative but the closing image reweights it with earned resonance. Subtext in the coded graffiti system and buoy hub adds depth. Complexity is present without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Time’s fragility is dramatized via the hourglass grain and chemical clock, not just asserted; “message in a bottle” risks telling, but the image earns it. The final refusal to look back and the crater flooded by indifferent sunlight reweight all prior material with mournful clarity. Progress versus preservation is treated with complexity without sermonizing. The resonance lingers as a charged repricing of what “launch” costs.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around translating uncertainty into direction, with blindness reframed as a unique lens. The water/refraction motif evolves from method to larger navigation metaphor, culminating in the drone guiding through fog. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Slight neatness keeps it shy of profound ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of perspective, interpretation over translation, and the marriage of language and landscape emerge through objects and action rather than lecture. The convergence motif shifts meaning at the end, and the final stove/ice image lands with earned resonance. Some thesis‑adjacent phrasing (“quiet science of condensation and convergence”) nudges toward statement. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of communal rhythm versus extractive haste emerge organically through footsteps, echo-testing, and the archway as “throat.” The ending reweights prior material without a moralizing bow: the wild hush transforms to a living pulse. A few declaratives (“We rebuild via the rhythm…”) skate close to thesis, but are dramatized immediately afterward. The result invites reflection on social balance and place without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence as harnessable power deepens from ritual memory into practical salvation, then reweights the closing image as an ongoing inner resource. The theme is carried by action and image (distilled quiet spiraling into the signal, the return of the vial), not just assertion. A few lines verge on stating thesis (“unsnarled death’s knot by surrendering to stillness”), but the resonance holds. The final charged poise—silence blooming within him under open sky—lands without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of truth, confession, and inherited disbelief are woven through particulars (lattice as talisman, confessional as portal, hush vs alarm). The closing image reweights the premise: he chooses silence to assert truth, not to hide it. A few abstract declarations (“weight of inherited lies,” “sustain the impossibility of his innocence”) edge toward telling, but the images carry the load. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of restitution, paradoxical care, and the cost of repair emerge organically from the bead’s “lovingly venomous” awakenings. The final image (inert bead in his palm; life thrumming) reweights guilt and grace without moralizing. One explicit line (“The debt requires both healing and harm”) edges toward telling, but it’s earned by action. Ambiguity lingers productively around forgiveness versus balance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of broken precedent transformed into living guide and ruin → reverence emerge organically from action and image. The final orchids/fragile path reprice the lost tower without moralizing. Subtext in sleepwalkers’ unconscious geometry and the plate’s revaluation builds a lingering aftereffect. The fisherman’s dream admission deepens communal memory without thesis‑statement intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of cyclical time, diasporic return, and restoration emerge from concrete acts (purposeful wandering → reassembly → shadow moving). The sundial’s journey from function to fragment to function again reframes “interrupted journeys” without sermonizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—continuation rather than reset—anchored in particulars. Complexity is present, if gently held.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: analog ritual as a conduit for recovering history; anonymity as a path to belonging, not erasure. The children’s chalk and “meaning in the margins” recur and shift meaning at the end. No moralizing; the final image (surface letter as “fragile, human pulse”) reweights the premise with earned poignancy. Ambiguity about the client’s future remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of “wisdom masked as foolishness” and “listening for unheard stories” is enacted through craft and subterfuge, not stated. Light/candle motifs accrue meaning and culminate in a quiet, resonant final stitch. The reply’s single blink reframes “silence” as charged signal. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers around the coming cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—courage to inhabit the breath before choice—emerges organically through the shard, condensation, and the gate image. The final conceptual repricing is strong, with the moonlight healing reading as earned grace, not erasure. A brief slide into explicit moralizing (“some apologies live not in words spoken…”) slightly blunts subtext. Otherwise, resonance persists beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—translation as an act that re-makes pain—emerges through objects and action rather than thesis. The coral’s reweighted meaning and the child’s cipher deliver an earned, resonant answer about remaking wounds. One sentence edges toward overt statement (“This was why he’d stayed”), but the closing image restores subtlety. Emotional aftereffect is tender without tipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of exposure as revelation, communal memory, and beauty persisting through decay emerge organically via particulars (exposed reel, fog canvas, grandmother’s maxim). The final image reweights the premise with a humane, resonant answer (joy as reaching, not destination). One line edges toward moralizing (“Joy wasn’t a destination...”), slightly flattening subtext. Otherwise, symbolism remains integrated rather than declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of curiosity vs. certainty and art as living resonance emerge organically through the device of reflected sound and the coin. Subtext exists in the “pause between question and reply” and in the mural as sonic record. The explicit thesis line (“Curiosity... is the most vital restoration of all”) edges into moralizing and blunts the otherwise lyrical implication. Still, the final cadence reframes restoration as listening, which lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of resistance-as-craft and communal cultivation arise organically from the tactic of making the garden the message. A few lines verge on thesis (“they cannot tax the geometry of resistance,” “the message is chaos”), slightly flattening subtext. The ending image reweights prior material—laughter and a flicker of anger signal restored agency. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images; the final sleep and “reef-shadow joy” offer a resonant, non‑literal answer to the opening ache. No moralizing intrudes; the armistice reframes conflict rather than erasing it. The postcard’s reweighting at the end binds absence and solace. Complexity persists in the acceptance that harmony, not victory, resolves the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Repairing the irreparable (“broken vessels still hold songs”) and kintsugi‑like ethics of care emerge organically through action rather than moralizing. The return of “foxglove regret” at victory prevents sentimentality and reweights the triumph. The final image reframes brokenness as conduit and duty as ongoing cost. A hair more contradiction (love versus preservation ethics) could add bite, but resonance is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of reparative truth as harmony emerge organically from the act of weaving promises across languages. The final image—cautious exuberance and a reweighted silence into melody—rings, though a couple sentences verge on thesis-stating. The ink well as fragile trust metaphor is earned and integrated, not grafted. Resonance is solid, if a touch overt in the last third.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—compassion embedded in engineering practice—emerges organically through events and objects (vinegar, chain, “Divert through the heart, not the wall”). The final image recasts authority and care as aligned, not opposed, without sermonizing. “Encrypted compassion” is stated but made concrete by the reveal and choice. Ambiguity remains around consequences, which strengthens resonance rather than blunting it.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of trust, redemption, and preservation vs. forgery emerge organically from action and image (dust as discipline; pigeons as faith). The meteorite’s “echoes” and paper trails interleave to revalue memory and truth. Two sentences edge toward overt moralizing (“Trust wasn’t about certainty…”; “The songs weren’t truly lost…”), slightly flattening subtext. Nonetheless, the final dust‑gold settling image resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—honoring necessary distance as love—emerges through object use and final posture, not mere assertion. The reprise (“sacredness wasn’t in the threshold itself but in the distance maintained”) risks explicitness yet earns its weight via the bow. Recurring images (grain, codes, thresholds) reweight meaning at the end. Complexity holds: reunion depends on restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Fire/sea counterpoint (burnt feather vs. bioluminescence) builds a coherent thematic arc from destruction to renewal, culminating in the “luminous respite” found together. Subtext rides gesture and image (shared exhale, fogged glass) more than declaration. A mild over‑articulation in the last paragraph (“she finally understood…”) trims the top end but doesn’t flatten resonance. The ending offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant idea: absence as seeded continuity; the meteor reframes loss into dispersal. The return of seeds and the cooling crater glass build thematic cadence. Final paragraphs tilt toward explicit promise (“She would teach others…”), edging into told moral rather than leaving the image to reverberate. Still, the non‑literal answer feels earned by the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of creativity within curated chaos emerge organically through image and action (bottles humming, the bishop as conductor). The ending reweights the premise—having proven the world’s hidden music, she chooses to play—without moralizing. Subtext about audience, attention, and authorship threads in quietly. Slight limitation: the emotional or ethical cost is more conceptual than felt, tempering afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of exile as homecoming, art as rebellion, and memory versus sterile edicts emerge organically through the ritual and its price. Recurring images (gaps, moonstone, obsidian) evolve in meaning and culminate in a non-literal answer: transformation of longing into starlight with bodily cost. The last lines risk slight declarative flourish but remain grounded in image. Subtext of censorship and embodied prophecy lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of repair, interconnection, and value-in-the-mundane emerge from particulars (glass stress lines, water rings, the atrium’s refraction) and culminate in a resonant final cadence. A few explicit thesis lines (“Value wasn’t in the atrium’s grand spectacle…”) slightly overstate what images already earn. Subtext in the ring‑reading and wake erase makes the insight feel lived rather than proclaimed. The last image reweights prior motifs without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    The motifs (fracture, ash, moonlight) evolve into a thematic answer: grief repurposed into prevention and communal language. However, some thematic statements are on-the-nose (“Not to dwell in guilt, but to forge warning from sorrow”), softening subtext. The final reweighting of the porcelain box as “a vessel for hard-won wisdom” is resonant. Emotional honesty largely avoids sentimentality despite a didactic edge.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of interdependence and collective effort grow organically from the iterative method and object reprise. However, the explicit statement “hope = (courage × connection) ÷ isolation²” in the final lines reads as a thesis and undercuts subtext. The piece’s strongest resonance is already in the image of the unified gauge and twin‑diamond ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres through particulars (ashes, strip, soot, resonator hum) rather than abstraction, culminating in a reweighted answer to “what walls dream.” Subtext in images—film as rescued future—does the heavy lifting. A few lines edge into explicit moralizing (“Legacy’s burden wasn’t meant to crush but to compel”), which trims subtlety. Overall resonance remains strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of possibility over reflection emerges organically through children’s songs repurposed to speak to adult longing. The ending’s “quiet certainty” reframes the ephemeral act as permanently consequential without sermonizing. A faint explanatory line (“not to create escape, but to illuminate…”) edges toward telling but is supported by concrete beats. Resonance lingers via the charged final sensory image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of humility, process, and redemption emerge through concrete action (admission, censure, dismantling) and charged images. A few direct statements (“ideal of peace… anchored in the practice of humility”) flirt with didacticism but are earned by the scene’s stakes. The final reweighting—terrace as foundation—delivers resonant, non-literal closure. Subtext in Kael’s flicker of possibility avoids neat moral balancing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of extraction, false benevolence, and futile atonement emerge from actions and images (egg as offering into the wound he created). The “echo” motif transforms from biology to resonance, reweighted in the final image with the raindrop and emptied pouch. Dialogue carries subtext without sermonizing, though “They remember the song” grazes the edge of overt statement. The aftertaste is complex and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of silence versus voice and embodied resistance emerge organically from her method and choices. The final image—the city’s raw chorus—reweights “chaste” as presence rather than absence. One line edges toward stating the thesis (“her silence had been the loudest defiance”), but the surrounding images carry the resonance. The mother’s echo threads deepen the moral texture without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of ethical storytelling emerges through particulars (stick, reversal, bar grime) and culminates in a resonant answer: transparency over pretense. Subtext operates in the surveillance dome repurposed for vulnerability and the charged silence. One line edges toward thesis statement (“ethical storytelling wasn’t about avoiding manipulation...”), slightly on‑the‑nose. The final placement of the stick provides a clean, non‑literal thematic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memorial, transience, and witness emerge organically from action and image; the joined wings reframe remembrance as living rather than static. The final “sanctuary built moment by moment” skirts explicitness but is earned by the scene’s particulars. Subtext operates through the cairn/wing counterpoint and the shift from stone to flight. The resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of forgiveness as groundwork and preservation as resistance emerge organically through objects and action (card → rope → light → bronze). The “Forgiveness had been the key, but preservation was the gift” line edges into stated moral, softening subtext. Still, the final constellation of bronze/light under ice provides an earned, resonant answer. Complexity remains, with resistance to oblivion framed as tender craft rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of stewardship vs. control and how land “chooses” attentive walkers emerge from particulars (seal, arch, deer, listening to the forest) and reweight at the end. The answer arrives through action, not lecture, though “It was never a command to guard” edges toward stated thesis. The final reconfiguration from guarding to witnessing resonates and invites reflection. Ambiguity remains productive rather than muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around humility versus spectacle, devotion encoded in empirical structures, and poverty as clarity; these arise from particulars (bowl, candle, tile, alignment) rather than thesis alone. The “empirically ironic” motif edges toward telling but is earned by the scene’s turns and the final repricing. The ending image (starlight replacing the candle) resonates as a non‑literal answer. Ambiguity lingers about cost and future danger without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of nonviolence, embodied memory, and release vs. grievance emerge organically through action and image. The lullaby’s return reframes “grace” as an immanent rhythm rather than deus ex machina. One line (“Resentment chains you…”) edges toward on‑the‑nose, but is buffered by subtextual beats (the shuddering exhale, the box falling silent). The ending resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of instrument vs. connection, inner harmony, and boundary dissolution emerge through action and image (breath, fog, prismed starlight) rather than abstract gloss. Silas edges toward thematic statement (“true navigation requires harmony within”), but the ending image earns the insight. The final web of light reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity is modest but coherent and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through action and image: vows as seasonal, wisdom carried in “silk and sap,” and mending as intergenerational bridge. The ribbon’s reweighting is a strong subtextual engine that answers the question of how tradition survives. A few lines verge on declarative thesis (“No legal document could contain this wisdom”), slightly over‑articulating what the images already show. The ending’s shared gesture and planned planting keep sentiment grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around non‑linear inheritance and the ethics of knowledge, culminating in the garden/time image that reweights the story. Subtext operates through the shell’s blankness filling with “remembered” images and the orchard’s responsiveness. The explicit thesis statements (“Non‑linear inheritance isn’t about…”) slightly flatten mystery, nudging into tell. Nonetheless, the final acceptance scene resonates beyond plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of the cost of knowledge and humility emerge organically through the required offering and the mountain’s negotiated terms. The final image resonates, though a few lines verge on explicit moral (“ensuring the library’s survival,” “for when humanity…”) and the written maxim states the thesis overtly. Subtext exists in the symphony/mountain imagery but is occasionally over-articulated. Still, the sacrifice reframes knowledge as a communal debt, not possession.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of “trapped freedom/unkindled solace” integrates with object and setting and culminates in a non-literal answer: solace must be kindled internally to proceed. The final image reweights prior motifs (green path, garden, stolen names) without resorting to moralizing. One line states insight a touch explicitly (“she understood—the solace wasn’t for the ship, but for her”), slightly reducing subtextual potency. Overall resonance lingers through image and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece reframes “absence” into an ethic of trust, using rope/seal to embody a bridge across gaps; the ending reweights prior images without sermonizing. One sentence edges toward explicit thesis (“Fables of absence weren’t about emptiness...”), slightly dimming subtext. Still, the final harmony and warm rope provide resonant thematic closure. Ambiguity remains humane, not muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Listening over force, transforming chaos rather than annihilating it, and earned repose emerge organically from action and image. The “bloom of hush” reweights prior motifs (map, crack-tracings, hum) without moralizing. The final stance (“silence itself was the truest guide”) functions as a resonant repricing with emotional afterglow. Complexity is maintained without tidy sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic throughline—meaning vs. randomness—emerges via recurring particulars (lark, thistles, stars) that reweight at the end. Occasional thesis statements (“the universe wove patterns”) risk overtness but are supported by scene pressure. Final image offers a resonant answer: a fragile, living light that reframes “coincidence” as patterned grace. Sentiment is earned through concrete struggle rather than told moral.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—identity sculpted from collective memory and the curator’s complicity in shaping it—emerges organically from method and image. The reprise of nostalgia and the charged hush at dawn reweight earlier material without sermonizing. One line leans toward thesis (“She was not just an archivist; she was a sculptor”), but it’s earned by prior beats. The ending invites reflection with a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of resilience and re‑scaled artistry emerge from particulars rather than sermonizing; the mosaic’s text is diegetic, not authorial moral. The flame refracting across shards reinterprets “spark” from spectacle to practice. The ending’s “Create” reframes playfulness as resistance, not escape. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of transition is woven through the cicada, droplet, and tides; the final image reweights the pause as generative, not void. Insights arise from particulars rather than aphorism, with minimal moralizing. The motif returns with new charge at the end. A few abstract lines (“Time wasn’t measured in hours here”) skim close to telling but remain supported by image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: protection versus nourishment, scarcity versus cultivation, quiet as a relational ecology. The doll‑to‑vine transformation reweights earlier motifs (vial, seven heartbeats) without moralizing. The insight about bunker logic versus living silence feels earned by struggle and surrender. The final image carries lingering ambiguity and promise without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silence redefined—from prison to balm—is dramatized rather than declared through image: the storm glass clearing, the terrace’s “sigh,” the child’s laugh absorbed without fracture. Recurring motifs (light, prisms, hum) reweight at the close. One sentence edges toward thesis statement (“teach silence how to comfort”), but it’s backed by action. The piece invites reflection on trauma’s echo without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of stewardship over conquest and reconciling past/future emerge through specific acts (coaxing paint; becoming “witness” rather than ruler). The final image—the smaller, brighter flake—reprices the throne as covenant and continuity. One line edges toward told thesis (“Her people had forgotten that balance”), but it aligns with enacted choices. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Grief-as-bridge and release-as-breath are dramatized rather than told, culminating in the child’s “unclenching” and the sanctuary’s “space after release.” The doorknocker reprise reframes thresholds as chosen solitude with a cost. Complexity persists: victory thins the guard line and deepens isolation. A few repeated phrases lightly telegraph theme but don’t tip into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transforming exploitation into resilience and deglamorizing “quantum promise” emerge through concrete images (mycelium, bolt, diamond). Subtext is present in repurposing the stolen bolt and the farm as a space where wonder can be abused. The final line’s aphoristic cadence borders on on‑the‑nose, softening the after‑sting. Overall resonance is earned, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of legacy, listening beyond words, and ethical severance emerges through action and image rather than thesis. The crank’s reweighting into a “key” and the charged silence in the final exit deliver resonance without moralizing, even as the line about “not the destroyer” edges toward explicit statement. Subtext runs through silence, light, and vibration; the realization carries aftermath. Thematic coherence lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece reframes duty as guarding potential rather than a fixed future, culminating in a final image that retrospectively tilts the Oracle’s charge. Recurring objects (program, lattice, vines) accrue meaning without sermonizing, and “shivering bliss” complicates triumph with awe and risk. Thematic emergence is organic, not stated as a moral. A sharper on‑page cost could have deepened the ache of the revaluation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of resilience, inheritance, and kindness emerge from concrete particulars and the reweighted button. However, explicit thesis lines (“Proof that love persists…,” “This work wasn’t about endings—…”) flirt with moralizing and reduce subtext. The letter’s phrasing provides the stronger, earned theme vehicle. The ending still lands, but restraint would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of resisting erasure and combating indifference emerge through concrete acts (truth broadcast, key sacrifice) and recurring images (puddles/constellations refiguring how to navigate truth). “Coded freedom” is embodied in tools and patterns rather than speechifying, though the phrase “tyranny of indifference” edges toward overt statement. The ending’s image reweights prior material without a tidy moral. Resonance lingers more in image than argument.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silence as creation, duty as art, and intergenerational stewardship emerge organically from particulars (grandfather echo, negative space method). The final hush and unbroken rainbows offer a resonant, non‑literal answer about maintenance over heroics. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the city’s ignorance and his solitude. Slightly limited by the lack of a sharper internal counter‑pull.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—restoration through remembrance rather than conquest—emerges from concrete acts (monuments as memory anchors) and reweights the closing image. A single explicit line (“The prophecy was clear… only if the forgotten things were remembered”) edges toward statement, but the scene earns it. The final reconfiguration invites reflection without tidy moralizing. Subtext in the seed‑work and “mossy delight” threads through without feeling schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of yielding to uncertainty arises from particulars (broken clocks, 3:07, improvisation, leaving the compass). The compass’s redefinition deepens the question of control versus listening. A few lines tip toward explicit thesis (“He hadn’t come to fix time but to let it flow”), trimming subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image carries resonant aftereffect without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around kintsugi as an ethic: integrating the break rather than erasing it, with names as vessels of weight. The final image (golden seam glowing) reweights prior material and lingers emotionally. However, a few lines state the thesis outright, edging toward moralizing and slightly diminishing subtext. Overall resonance remains earned and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of shame, embodiment, and survival emerge organically from the act of sounding truth loose; the laughter’s revaluation is earned. The final image (“clear water” laughter, dawn deepening) resonates without didactic summary. One line (“It wasn’t mockery…”) skews explanatory, but it’s dramatized within action and doesn’t flatten complexity. The piece invites reflection on bodily reflex vs. moral judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme—mercy as navigated structure rather than absolution—emerges from concrete action (angling into gradients) and recurring images (fractals, strap), not platitudes. The interrogator’s line risks thesis‑statement but is repurposed by the ending’s repricing. The final cadence offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: mercy is a vector choice under ongoing cost. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—recovering suppressed histories and reframing “superstition” as translation—emerges from specific acts with recurring images (light, lens, names). The final realization that the lighthouse “translated the language of the between-worlds” reweights prior material without an explicit moral. The grandmother motif is well‑deployed, though the line “proving that honoring overlooked histories could make an instant eternal” edges toward telling. Subtext mostly lives in objects and tactics rather than dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ceilings, cracks, and time cohere around release versus keeping secrets; the ending reweights Silas’s obsession into an ethic of letting go. Imagery (mainspring/time, bird applause) carries theme without sermonizing. Slight tidiness—ghost freed, dawn breaks—limits lingering complexity. Still, the “weightless burden” evolving to relief is resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of perfection versus negotiated reality emerges through concrete events: the whisper as flaw/clarifier, the mirror-page as compression of eternity. The ending reweights cause—revelation not instigation—without sermonizing. Motifs reprise with meaning (frost patterns, rustling, mirror), inviting reflection on preservation versus transformation. Lack of moral neatness is a strength; personal emotional ambivalence could be deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around science vs. dogma, revolution’s unintended erasures, and rituals as engineered compassion; the final image reprices the civilization’s wisdom. However, lines like “We destroyed the very wisdom we needed…” and “They didn’t cover mirrors to hide…” tilt toward stated thesis, slightly dulling subtext. The sorrow is earned through particulars (dust, cold shard, calm mirror) and lingers. Complexity remains—victory without solace.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Truth versus corruption is dramatized, not declared; rust, lilies, and resonance refract the theme through action. The final image (golden note, lilies reblooming) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. “Mending what isn’t torn” deepens the idea that harmony, not force, repairs the world. The piece resists tidy binaries by holding cost alongside victory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of awe vs. explanation and memory as pre‑explanatory language emerge through particulars (petrichor as “language,” the compass as lodestone). The final passage reweights knowledge into presence without didacticism. One explicit thesis sentence slightly blunts subtext. Overall resonance lingers via image, not moral.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of “complexity folded into simplicity” and “timewoven alliances” is developed through images of fishermen, shipbuilders, the arch, and the driftwood—then reweighted in the closing bridge metaphor. Some lines verge on thesis (“Her motivation crystallized...”), slightly flattening subtext. The grandmother’s maxim integrates cleanly and pays off in the final stance. The ending invites reflection without tidy moralizing despite a few explicit statements.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: darkness as gentler light and grief’s truth emerging in hush. The etched‑glass mechanism embodies “hidden layers,” and the final mural offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing from the narrator. Leo’s quoted lines toe the edge of explicitness but are integrated as artifact‑voice, not authorial sermon. The reweighting of “night‑blooming” from botany to trust/grief lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, justice, and cross-temporal solidarity arise organically through action rather than moralizing. The “parley with the past” reframes archives as active resistance, and the last image reweights the story’s symbols without a stated thesis. Ambiguity remains—victory carries burden—producing resonance. It stops short of a profound counter-reading, but the integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of illusion vs. reality and communal resilience arise organically from objects and labor images; the ending’s lanterns offer a non-literal answer. A few lines verge on thesis statement (“False comfort had always been the Cove’s poison”), slightly flattening subtext. The bottle’s reweighting from loss to potential is an elegant conceptual repricing. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing overall.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: preservation versus erasure, innocence as access to dangerous knowledge, archives as tombs. The final revaluation is earned via particulars (childhood theft enabling doom’s message), not thesis statements, despite one declarative line about the archive’s purpose. Subtext in dead languages as conduits for suppressed futures lands strongly. The ending invites reflection without neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: stewardship versus entropy, time as lived texture rather than data, and the ethics of borrowing time. The final repricing—“she had felt time’s grain”—reweights the mission from preservation to embodied understanding. No sermonizing; resonance comes through image (meltwater chime) and tactile knowledge. Complexity is present, though moral ambiguity is gentle rather than thorned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—attention over alarm, humility before living systems—emerges from concrete acts and the bell’s reweighted meaning. The elder’s aphorism risks slight on‑the‑nose echo, but the ending image resists moralizing by showing, not telling. The final bell note functions as a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Complexity persists in the accepted cost of disobedience.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance is strong: vulnerability as a vessel for light is earned through the star‑tracing method and the embodied endurance. The yellow shard’s reprise and the dawn image reweight prior material without needing explication. However, explicit thematic statements (“even broken things channel light,” “He had not conquered the storm; he had held space for it”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtextual charge. The piece still invites reflection, but with a touch of on‑the‑nose framing.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: silence as stewardship, covenantal memory, and the ethics of holding unsaid words. Recurring images (bees, glass, ash, honeycomb) reweight the final stance without overt moralizing. A few sentences verge on stating theme directly (“They were not trapped; they were messengers”), slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final charged stillness answers the core question with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around time as material—wound and weave—and memory’s stewardship; images (ash, gear, green/gold light) reweight meaning at the end. Subtext of self‑address across broken chronology is earned through specific acts, not pronouncement. The closing charged poise—patience as craft—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Complexity persists (risk, surveillance) beneath the quiet triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    Images (snapped string, feather, rain‑washed lagoon) carry the thematic turn from wholeness to connection effectively. However, several thesis‑forward lines (“completion was a myth, but connection was real”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The ending’s gesture returns to image, mitigating the didactic notes. Resonance is genuine, if a touch over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from particulars—architecture as diplomacy, collaboration over domination—embodied in the copper guidance and stone‑tree reciprocity. The final line (“Not me, but the pact”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about legacy and respect. A few explicit statements (“what right had humans…”; “manifesto”) tilt toward moralizing, softening subtext. Still, the “They listen” revelation and sparrow image carry earned, lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—home as a measurable reaction versus spiritual pageantry—emerges from concrete acts (soil, rain, resin) and reweights at the end. The amber and rain chemistry provide a persuasive, specific metaphor turned literal. One line edges toward told moralizing (“The pilgrims sought meaning in stars…”) which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final realization resonates beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of restoration over monument, language bridging species/time, and translating water‑harmony to land accrue through concrete acts. The “submerged concord” reweights into a land‑born concord at the end without moralizing. Symbols (seed pods, shells, jetty) work in scene, not as labels. Resonance lingers, though ambiguity remains comfortably navigable rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of translating distance into closeness is enacted through concrete acts—scent-mapped world, the leaf’s literal “tinting,” text hidden in sound grooves. The final reweighting—map not to a body but to home—delivers earned repricing without moralizing. Recurring images (leaf, hush, scents) deepen resonance and avoid didacticism. Complexity remains, with hope charged by the cost of leaving stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    “True north” evolves from motif to literal and moral anchor, reframing guilt into vocation without sermonizing. The family ritual and compass recur to produce resonance rather than symbol-harvesting. A few on-the-nose phrases (“not as a metaphor”) blunt subtlety slightly. Overall, the final image reweights prior material with a measured, lingering charge.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of “amending” vs stealing and “sacred play” emerge through concrete acts (precise swaps, playful offerings) and culminate in a resonant repricing (he amends himself). Some thematic articulation is overt via Elara’s quoted precepts, which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final image—sundial stilled, sky mended—answers the piece’s question about wonder as active craft. Ambiguity remains in a productive way without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres through recurring particulars—the pawnless board, the penumbra, dust‑spelled words, the tile shard—culminating in a revaluation of memory and expendability. Subtext lives in gestures and silence; no moralizing intrudes. The final images (placing the pawn, walking “TRUTH”) offer a resonant, non‑literal answer to the premise. The kings/queens vs. pawns motif is re‑priced without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—home reframed as texture rather than map—without moralizing. The feather/stone motif evolves from tool to truth‑vessel, and the ending reweights prior material with emotional aftershock. Insights feel earned by embodied struggle rather than assertion. Resonance lingers as the mountain’s heartbeat fuses setting and self.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of agency, manipulation, and forgiveness emerge through objects (labyrinth, tapestry) rather than lecture. The final image reweights earlier motifs (“pawn in a larger game” → compass to peace) with satisfying resonance. One line leans toward moralizing (“Forgiveness… integrating its lessons”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall, insight feels earned from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: refracting light as reframed truth, echoes as communal voice, forgiveness as shared clarity rather than surrender. The final command reweights the premise without a didactic moral, though lines like “Silence isn’t sacred; it’s a cage” flirt with thesis‑saying. Subtext in Vanya’s tears and the canyon’s “exhale” sustains resonance. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kintsugi ethos resonates through concrete acts and the statue’s narrated past, culminating in a charged acceptance image. However, explicit theme statements (“strength lies not in perfection...”; “Meaning wasn’t salvation... it was the act of mending itself”) tilt toward moralizing and reduce subtext at the end. The imagery carries enough to sustain the idea without those declarations. The result remains moving but less subtle than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of “temporary eternity” emerges through place, object, and vow, with the shell’s final placement reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in image (constellations pulsing, water’s kiss) rather than speech, and the last movement reframes the harbor as threshold. A couple of explicit thematic sentences risk slight overstatement but do not blunt the resonance. Emotional aftereffect is earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of quiet, precise love versus brute force integrates through recurring images and the method itself. The closing sentence reweights the premise effectively, but lines like “love travels farthest when it doesn’t demand to be heard” edge into articulated moral. Subtext otherwise rides gesture (not cheering, the cork as anchor). Resonance is earned but slightly overdeclared.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Reverse migration refracts grief into purpose: the piece reweights loss through action rather than didactic statement. The censer as a ritual‑tech bridge makes the final image—stars pivoting from wounds to beacons—resonate as earned repricing. A few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“The geography of loss had shifted”), but the scene work carries the meaning. Subtext hums in the calls’ ambiguity and the trade of relic power for communal salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth, safety, and the cost of empathy arise from concrete actions and recurring images (eye, fracture, orchard). The Dr. Vanya line reframes “grace in the fracture,” anchoring the ending’s repricing. However, “Psychological safety wasn’t silence; it was the space...” states the thesis a touch directly, dulling subtext at the finish. Despite that explicitness, the ending still resonates through image and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of home, witness, and isolation as shared burden emerge through image and act rather than thesis. The Edelweiss’s reweighted meaning and the “gaps as bridges” insight earn their resonance from prior particulars. Sentiment is kept in check by tactile choices (pressing the flower, keeping the light brighter). A single near‑overt line skirts moralizing but remains voice‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs (maps, VERITAS, branching paths) coherently build a theme about the weight of choices and refigured loneliness. The final image resonates, but the sentences “The doorway… wasn’t a place, but a moment…” verge on on‑the‑nose explication, softening subtext. Still, the ants-as-logic and the charged retrieval of the damp chip carry genuine, earned meaning. Complexity lingers without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of duty transformed by love, quiet authority over spectacle, and disenchantment reconfigured into earned stewardship are woven through action and image. The fireflies/shared exhale motif shifts from memory to method, reweighting the final command. There’s no moralizing; resonance arises from particulars and the closing dawn. A touch more ambiguity about the cost of such power could deepen the aftertaste further.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thematic arc (“presence over possession”) emerges organically via image and action, especially the capping of the vial and the final walk. A few overt thesis sentences (“capture was a thief; presence was the only true vessel”) edge toward on‑the‑nose and slightly thin the subtext. Still, motif reweighting (shell, light sources) carries the resonance. The ending offers a non‑literal answer without tying every thread.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of self‑envy, time fracture, and art as suturing emerge from concrete acts (writing as “surgery,” the grave as anchor) rather than pronouncement. The “jaded wonder” synthesis at the end offers a resonant non‑literal answer: bearable meaning over conquest. Recurring images (wind, bark, fire) shift meaning from nostalgia’s trap to fuel. Ambiguity remains purposeful; no moral is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of being seen, occlusion, and the revaluation of absence emerge through objects and gesture rather than thesis. The screw/bowl contrast reframes creation and loss; the drip/time motif carries subtext. A couple of lines verge on statement (“The scentless world wasn’t empty…”), but they are anchored in concrete action and don’t collapse into moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without tidy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief transmuted into meaning and craft as survival emerge organically from the ritual and inscriptions. Recurring images (storm hush, quill, tea bowl, crystals) reweight at the end without a didactic moral. A couple of declarative lines name the insight a touch plainly, but the imagery carries most of the resonance. The final poise (“ready to write the very next story”) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of apology, imperfect miracles, and the ethics of cutting versus renewal emerge through action and images (the chipped stopper, the hum, saplings). One line edges toward thesis‑speak (“silence is the arrhythmia”), but most resonance is earned by scene. The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the switch from “exorcism” to “reconciliation” deepens meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of illusion versus unification emerges through particulars: the recast definitions of “void” and “time,” the spiral method, and the hush that deepens as illusions peel. The final image reweights everything—witness becoming weaver—without moralizing. The dictionary’s “wanderingly exact” phrasing threads concept into action. Slight risk of overt statement is mitigated by the device of the cosmic dictionary embodying theme.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core theme—time as the razor boundary between nows, measured in heartbeats—emerges from image patterns (water, edge, pulse) and the ritual. The final reweighting avoids a tidy moral, offering a resonant reframing that lingers. Occasional explicit statements (“clocks didn’t measure time… mortality”) verge on telling and shave some subtlety. Still, the green flash and key‑compass image secure a strong aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic arc—protection as permission, “letting go” over control—emerges through action (pressing, handing over) and the network’s response. Several lines lapse into overt thesis statements (“Light only needs permission to flow,” “Letting go revolutionizes all”), dulling subtext. Still, the concept is coherently embodied in the closing image of a reconfigured security ethos. Resonance lingers, if somewhat stated rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (mica’s fragility, “7=truth,” rain) carry the theme effectively into the charged final image. Subtext operates well in the old woman’s warning and the father’s “life’s not in the math.” However, lines like “And sometimes, the fallacy is what saves us” tilt toward a stated moral, blunting resonance. Despite that, the conceptual repricing largely holds.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of endings folding into beginnings and grace in letting go emerge through recurring sound and refusal. The glass loop reweights meaning at the end without needing exposition. A couple of aphoristic lines risk didacticism but are character‑true and embedded in scene. The final image resonates beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory vs. progress and resistance through small acts are deeply woven into images and action. However, several thesis‑like lines (“Her work wasn’t nostalgia; it was resistance…”) edge toward didactic clarity that the images already carry. The final image reweights the premise without neat moralizing. Subtext in the teen’s silent recognition works well.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through reciprocity, the rumor chain as catalyst, and the moon rock’s reweighting; the closing image answers the question via communal presence. A slight ding for explicit moralizing (“turns out it’s mostly just showing up”), which states what the images already imply. Subtext in the mask slipping and barter‑economy gestures works well. The emotional aftereffect is warm, earned, and not saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete acts: sensing with skin, following music, and the ring finally orienting to her heart. The ending offers a resonant answer—stillness is forged, not found—without collapsing into outright moralizing; the “quiet blaze” image reweights prior beats. Brother/lullaby integration adds subtext without speechifying. A hair’s breadth from over‑articulation in the final statement, but the scene has earned it.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (seeds, threshing, unbending) cohere, and the ending reweights meaning toward process over outcome. However, the final line articulates the thesis directly (“meaning wasn’t in the harvest but in the threshing”), tipping into thematic echo/moralizing. Subtext otherwise works through image (empty pen, softened spirals). Strong resonance dulled by explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: attention transforms absence; listening is rebellion. Subtext runs through gesture and objects (empty camera, chalked “nothing”), with the flute converting concept to felt sound. A few lines verge on thesis statements but do not override the scene’s earned resonance. The final image offers a non‑didactic answer: endurance as art with a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    The preservation-through-destruction paradox resonates, and images (serpent-swallowed constellation, blank scroll, ash veil) carry thematic weight. However, explicit thesis statements (“She wasn’t a criminal; she was a guardian.” and the concluding declaratives) nudge into moralizing, dulling subtext. The final repricing—meaning over location—lands. A subtler last paragraph would deepen afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grief versus institutional erasure emerges through image and action rather than thesis, with rebellion recast as care. The lagoon motif returns charged, shifting from hope to “auroral sorrow,” reweighting the premise. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: endurance with cost rather than cure. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “whispers over shouts” theme is organically embodied in tactics and environmental acoustics, culminating in the quiet proof note. However, the closing sentence states the thesis a touch outright, edging toward moralizing rather than letting the image alone resonate. Subtext still works via echoes, footsteps, and the storm’s noise failing where subtlety succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through enactment—light made from darkness without speech—rather than sermon, though a few lines name it (“teach darkness the value of stars,” “not its end, but its adornment”). The final cadence (star held, then shutters closed) offers a non‑literal answer about presence and witness. Subtext rides gesture and image, sustaining emotional honesty without schmaltz. Slight explicitness trims the mystique.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of doubt, memory, and quiet resistance emerge through particulars (mirrored cards, erased histories, tree from stone). The final image reweights earlier motifs (forest of second thoughts → literal arboreal reflection) without preachiness. The line “It was a humble rebellion” risks on‑the‑nose labeling but the scene work carries it. The pawn exchange and the girl’s fear deepen the subtext of communal solitude turned recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of self‑acceptance and homecoming accrue organically via the object and island motifs. Strong closing image reweights prior shame as birthright, with the pod’s acceptance echoing her internal shift. Some lines veer toward statement (“Detaching was not abandonment...”), trimming subtext in favor of explanation. Even so, resonance lingers through image rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece engages a nuanced theme of coerced joy versus authentic sorrow through concrete acts rather than sermonizing. Subtext works in Elara’s performative narration as camouflage and the potato‑darkness line. One on‑the‑nose moment (“A metaphor”) slightly blunts subtlety. The final image reweights prior motifs into a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—boundaries as fear‑wounds healed by aesthetic re‑meaning—emerges from enacted paraphrase rather than lecture, with recurring images (shadow, quartz, hum) reconfigured at the end. Lines like “The boundary is a wound” and “Fear guards emptiness” risk thesis‑statement clarity but are delivered as art‑acts, not moralizing. The final image (sanctum to beacon; shadow as bridge) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains enough to invite reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically: imperfection, exchange, and non-verbal fluency converge in the final revaluation of “light within the break.” Subtext rides gesture (the plant patterns, the returned reed) rather than thesis. The last line risks mild explicitness but is earned by the preceding image-work. Ambiguity about cost and gift lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars—the lens refracting residues, dust as sonic fossils, and the final acceptance of felt absence. The closing image meaningfully reweights prior motifs without resorting to plot summary. A brief explicit thesis line (“True rediscovery required presence…”) edges toward telling, slightly dulling subtext. Overall, the resonance is strong and avoids neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of resilience, intention as attention, and transforming grief into cultivation emerge through objects and actions (seeds in orbs, coordinates, projection). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, inviting reflection on where and how to “teach withering to bloom.” Occasional explicit lines (“She wouldn’t just mourn; she’d cultivate.”) edge toward statement but are supported by scene work. Subtext lives in the communal response and the repurposed observatory.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of narrative collapse, communal grief, and remapping trust arise organically from tools and choices; recurring objects reweight meaning at the end. Dialogue occasionally states thesis (“collapse of a narrative”) yet remains in character and scene‑driven. The final image achieves resonance without moralizing. The emotional aftertaste is thoughtful and steady rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—nostalgia’s danger and the necessity of impermanence—emerges organically from the method and its cost. However, the final paragraph leans toward explicit moralizing (“They had sought to harness nostalgia... trapped their souls in endless, looping grief”), reducing subtext. The last image still resonates (fragile light, heavier veil), but the thesis is somewhat stated rather than wholly earned through implication. The conceptual reweighting remains strong despite the didactic tint.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme integrates cleanly: hope’s integrity vs. the seduction and distortion of shared dreams, answered by a solitary, unshareable core. Recurring images (roots in stone; ember vs. bonfire; pollinating silver drift) reweight the premise at the end. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“the consequence of shared hope misplaced”), but the images carry the resonance. The final ember image lands with mature ambiguity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of trust, ethical responsibility, and reconstruction accrue through particulars—the tail as “silent witness,” the layered shedding motif, the dawn cadence. Insight comes from on‑page labor, not moralizing. The final image reweights “fragile convictions” into action‑borne integrity. Ambiguity remains human, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of scars as narrative, not wounds to be reopened, emerges from particulars (coffee rings, abdominal ridge, plant whispers) and culminates in a quiet, resonant reweighting. The displaced miracle pivot integrates concept and theme without sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is earned by image and cost (“Silence. The fern’s voice gone.”). A hint of explicitness in the final articulation keeps it just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (interstitial spaces, forgotten lyrics, light vs. gaps) accrue toward a resonant answer: love kept alive in memory and charged absence. The sonic key and crystal reprise the theme without feeling token. However, the line “The crystal gazer had found where unused love is stored: in the act of remembering...” edges into thesis‑telling, slightly flattening subtext at closure. The piece mostly earns its insights through image; trimming the explicit moral would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—rest as sacred, active devotion that liberates stifled art—emerges organically from ritualized action, not assertion. The “tomb of unmade art” reweights the whole premise and the final calm river of aurora enacts the ethical/aesthetic release. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: only focused, sacrificial attention restores a silenced world. Complexity holds (ecstasy braided with loss) without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: tending small, stubborn life over salvaging deterministic certainty; light in unlit corners reweights the human project. Recurring images (midnight clock, fractured song, spores) accrue meaning and modulate to a hopeful but earned close. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the cost of letting the old map go. The final dream answers the premise without telling it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—surrendering control to rejoin a living system—emerges organically from image and act (hum aligning body and forest, gear bridging mind and mechanism). The final purification image reweights prior material without heavy instruction. A few lines edge toward thesis (“mistaking control for wisdom”), but the imagery largely carries the argument. Resonance lingers through the map of neural pathways mirroring roots.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic throughline—courage as process rather than destination—is coherently seeded and reweighted at the end. The guide’s line (“Courage unused waits not in a place, but in the crossing.”) runs a touch declarative, but images (ticket’s star‑hole, palm‑press, black sand) carry most of the resonance. Recurring motifs (leash, vigil, stars) evolve meaningfully. The piece avoids overt moralizing and trusts the final image to answer the question.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of safety vs soul, penance, and the possibility of thaw accrue through images (bolt, frost, groaning fortress) and culminate in a resonant final stance. However, several sentences state the thesis directly (“The unpardonable silence wasn’t just the absence of sound…”) which blunts subtext. The final offering and vow deliver a non‑literal answer that lingers. Ambiguity remains purposeful rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around truth dissolving performance, stewardship versus spectacle, and courage without conquest. Recurring particulars (ink, books, constellations, crown) accrue and reweight at the end without moralizing. Subtext of humility wielding quiet power is clear, if not paradoxically tested. Resonance lingers, though complexity is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of long‑tail consequence and the limits of policy against ecological time accrue through particulars (bleaching witness, storm surges as “periodically eternal”). The final cadence reweights everything: the ban halted “bleeding,” but the patient still dies, a resonant, non‑didactic answer. One or two abstract lines edge toward statement, but the ending relies on image and rhythm rather than moralizing. Subtext rides image (tapping, swaying station) rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of renewal vs despair coheres through recurrent images (hum, dawn, rubble) and the chosen method. However, the explicit assertion (“the rebellion’s true enemy wasn’t the oligarchs, but despair”) tips into thesis-stating, diluting subtext. The ending image is resonant, but some sentiment blends with telling. Still, the symbolic economy largely earns its emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around guided destiny versus passive tradition, with the kite tail and embryo reframing prophecy as participatory. The final image (hybrid plant; “honored tradition by changing it”) offers a resonant answer without preachy overexplanation, though a few lines skate close to thesis statement. Subtext runs through natural voices (plants) and landscape pain. The resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of realism vs. optimism and tending beauty amid erosion emerge through concrete acts and recurring images (photo, sea holly, lighthouse). The final “compass” image reweights prior material without needing a plot moral. A brief declarative pair (“Optimism wasn’t… Realism was…”) edges toward thesis stating, softening the subtlety. Overall, resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: art, fate, and the necessity of embracing fractures. The tarot/threads/lens pattern shifts meaning at the end, reweighting “perfection” into “wholeness‑through‑cracks.” One explicit line (“Beauty lived in the cracks”) edges toward stating the thesis, slightly dimming subtlety. Still, resonance rides images (luminescent silk on her hands, beam no longer fractured) rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core theme—time’s slowness as perceptual overdrive rather than mercy—emerges from concrete action and images (the ink’s crisis‑light flare). However, multiple thesis statements (“She had discovered why time slows in crisis: it doesn’t”) drift into didactic echo, especially late, dampening subtext. The final image still resonates, but the moral is stated rather than allowed to wholly bloom in implication.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence vs. speech evolves into a resonant “roar,” and snow as cover/erasure turns to burial of lies—an earned conceptual shift. The piece avoids sermonizing by dramatizing consequences (assembly, flood of feeds), though some on‑nose phrases recur. Elara’s motive (“unspoken conversation”) is enacted, not just stated. The final image reweights earlier motifs with emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Care versus conquest is dramatized through specific acts, with “quiet” reweighted from inscription to tactic. Subtext runs through nurturing gestures under threat, culminating in a resonant final image. One line (“The roses remember. They know the quiet.”) edges toward stating the thesis, but most meaning arises from action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around order/chaos, silence/music, and communal care; the final “feral lullaby” reweights the story’s earlier feral dance and broken harmonies. The echo’s capture functions as a non-literal answer to sleeplessness and a restoration earned through risk. Subtext of craft-as-devotion and the cost of holding a community’s sleep hums beneath the action. No platitudes or sermonizing intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Time versus truth entwines with “Time doesn’t lie” and closes on a released satellite—conceptual repricing of legacy through evidence. “Orbits of regret” returns with a reweighted meaning as she breaks the orbit via action. A brief brush with on‑the‑nose logic exposition risks didacticism, but the images largely carry the resonance without a stated moral. The thematic afterglow is earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of guilt, translation, and turning sound into mercy emerge through objects and acts rather than statements. The mother’s letters reweight blame across time; the final hush reframes silence as grace, not avoidance. Ambiguity remains humane—guilt is hushed, not erased—creating lingering resonance. No sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Patterns/spirals, the tile’s resonance, and the hush interweave to express a theme of meaning emerging from unlearning. However, explicit statements like “Meaning wasn't a straight line; it was a spiral, born from unlearning and faith” verge on moralizing and undercut subtext. The final image otherwise earns a contemplative aftereffect without sermonizing. Thematic cohesion is strong; subtlety wavers at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of mercy versus vengeance and the politics of memory emerge organically from the mosaic’s reveal and the renaming act. Subtext operates in the soldiers’ “aberrant mercy” and the city’s desire for a simple narrative. A few lines verge on overt moralizing (“We bury this truth, we bury our chance to heal”), slightly flattening the resonance. The final threshold image still reframes the premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of limited repair, earned hope, and art’s afterlife emerge through particulars (tarot coin, saved tear becoming a pearl) rather than stated morals. The ending reweights the premise: mending doesn’t erase loss but seeds a new possibility within fracture. Ambiguity is meaningful—she remains unmoored, the theater falls, yet the echo endures. The resonance lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of listening versus forcing is enacted through somatic markers and the refracted light, not just stated. The muscovite’s fractal logic reweights the premise at the end; “It wasn’t telepathy… It was something better” risks stating the thesis but is earned by the scene. Subtext in Lena’s “affectionate skeptic” stance and their synced breathing undergirds the shift from hype to humane understanding. The emotional afterglow is delicate and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Resilience, memory in landscape, and transitional objects emerge from image and action—the floating fossil reweights hope from diary theory to embodied fact. Subtext about custodianship vs. possession quietly underlies her tears and choice. A touch of explicit statement (“Survivors needed more than geological surveys…”) edges toward telling but mostly supports the earned resonance. The final commitment to “spectral conversations” answers the thematic question without a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of communal, transmissible wisdom and reframing doom into renewal emerges through objects and acts (buttons as language, hourglasses as offerings). The final image reweights prior material without needing a moral, though lines like “The prophecy had never been a sentence—it was a seed” edge toward explicit statement. Subtext runs through the intergenerational craft and counter‑reading of authority. The emotional aftereffect is hopeful yet grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “fixing what’s broken” accrues through object (pillbox), method (careful snow codes), and relationship (Mara’s acceptance). The defector’s line about not being alone reframes the mission in human terms and informs the closure. Some thematic statements (“unused courage… waiting to be claimed”) verge on spelled‑out, softening ambiguity. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without resorting to sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thematic throughline—distilling complexity to essence, mending as layered promise—emerges from concrete acts rather than thesis. The needle’s reprise reframes the crossing as care, not conquest, and the final quiet nod resists sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers in the cost of perpetual vigilance and the acceptance of wear. No moralizing undercuts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres: care as phototropic light that can bend time; the shard as vessel; making as ethics. Recurring images (sun patterns, thrum, lavender, the lantern) meaningfully shift at the end when the glass “generates” light. A few lines verge on thesis (“kindness was a kind of light”) which slightly blunts subtext. Nonetheless, the final bow and the warmed shard sustain resonance without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (“protection as illumination, not walls”) emerges from particulars: a locksmith’s tool turned liberator, roses as hinge rather than end, light refracted into absence. The closing reconfigures meaning without a moral lecture; the city’s “gentle hum” earns its uplift through action. The locksmith’s aphorism edges toward explicitness but is grounded by the work on the page. Resonance lingers through image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through image and action: resonance as a means to carry loss, coexistence over obliteration, memory as tide rather than weapon. The sundial/hum motif reweights at the end, converting brittle pain into sustaining cadence. One line edges toward articulation (“independence wasn’t forgetting”), but it’s earned by the scene’s cost. The final image holds conceptual and emotional afterglow without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of connection, anonymity, and communal vulnerability emerge through action and image rather than sermonizing. The nest motif reweights at the end (“larger nest”), offering a resonant answer without stating a moral. The installation reframes “keeping secrets” as shared courage. Slight neatness in the final harmony is offset by the felt risk in her confession.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mirrored “power plays” above and below integrate with action rather than mere commentary, culminating in a quiet defiance that reweights the conflict from committee rooms to evidence in hand. Recurring images (static vs clean signal; charts as maps of resistance) earn the ending’s resonance. The theme is stated a bit overtly in places, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the final whisper of the cosmos lands as an earned counterpoint to noise.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Entropy versus human duty, and “mutiny born of longing” develop through particulars (organ as grief/hope carrier; key as insufficient cure). The final walk toward the church holds a resonant, non‑literal answer. A single line edges into stated moral (“healing demanded more than just a tool”), trimming subtlety. Overall, subtext outweighs statement.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Concealment vs. exposure integrates via mask/ribbon and prosopagnosia; the final image reweights memory into presence. However, explicit thesis lines (“Masks show us…”; “justice found a new path”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The portrait as essence is a strong thematic vehicle that largely carries the weight. Resonance lingers more through images than arguments.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—truth as a means to reverse a social exile—emerges through object work and the coded‑map method rather than sermonizing. The nail’s meaning shifts from death token to “key,” offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Some lines tilt toward explicit explanation (“Honor wasn’t in the grave...”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the final stance carries a clear, earned moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Pixelated amnesty” integrates across object, action, and final image, culminating in moss growing through the broken bow—an earned, non‑literal answer to the central question. Thematic development arises from particulars (glass shard/pixel mapping to forgiven trespasses) rather than thesis statements. Resonance lingers without moralizing, though the titular phrase is repeated a touch often. The reweighting at the end feels inevitable and emotionally clean.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Territory, inheritance, and ethical mapping emerge through particulars (currency, markers, spiral) and reweight at the end. The insight largely earns itself through action; however, a few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“Some paths circle back not as punishment, but as correction”). Subtext still breathes in the images, with the bills reframed as warnings. The final walk toward town functions as thematic answer without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring motifs (variable stars, daylily, linked laborers) converge to embody the theme of shared burdens and healing through witness. The ending reweights prior images with emotional clarity. Slight overtness in the explicit statement (“Carry not alone,” “We lift together”) trims subtlety. Nonetheless, resonance lingers in the charged final image rather than mere assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The motif of mirrors vs depth matures into an earned insight—truth requires breaking the reflective surface—without moralizing. The lake’s history refracted in shards reframes the premise and integrates guilt, necessity, and repair. Thematic elements arise from particulars (seed’s hunger vs lake’s malice; confession as ice) rather than abstract statements. The resonance lingers as acceptance rather than absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: progress vs stewardship, pain as connective tissue (“Scars are maps to belonging”), and covenant as living contract. The final reweaving image offers a non‑literal answer—connection over domination—without sermonizing. A few mantra‑like lines flirt with explicitness, but remain character‑voiced. Resonance lingers through the object’s reprise and charged setting.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: bargains require balance; meaning-making as resistance carries cost; becoming what you negotiate with. The Fool card’s void, the half-joined circle, and the lullaby evolve from hope to tempered custodianship. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the final image of voice as the last unbartered asset. Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo/silence/resonance accrue through concrete particulars, culminating in a redefinition of value and purpose. The final movement reframes failure and quiet as charged space rather than void. One line (“Purpose wasn't found in flawless displays…”) veers toward explicit moralizing, dulling the otherwise earned subtext. Overall, thematic weave is strong and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of knowing vs experiencing, science/spirit harmonics, and ancient/modern bridges emerge organically through action and object returns. The final charged poise—understanding the mechanism but not the essence—reweights the whole. One line (“He understood it now: the transition wasn't a rupture…”) edges toward exposition, but the closing image restores subtlety. Resonance lingers without neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of contradiction-as-alloy and honoring transience emerges through action and recurrent objects; the brass quill/scrolls enact it. Occasional direct statements (“Routine wasn’t emptiness”) slightly over-explain what the images already carry. The closing cadence reconfigures “preservation” as a living, tidal process. Resonance lingers without tidy moral, despite a few explicit theses.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring images (hush, crystal, spiral) refract the theme of connection versus fear, and the ending reweights the premise via a communal release. However, explicit thesis statements (“What was needed wasn’t closure, but connection”) undercut subtext in the final third. Despite that, the final image holds a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers. Emotional aftereffect is genuine without tipping into sentimentality at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Recurring images (maps, currents, bellows, ivy) shift meaning toward release in the end; the accordion’s broken beauty embodies the theme without strain. The graffiti line risks platitude, but its diegetic origin and reprise redeem it. The final stance answers the question non-literally and lingers. A few explicit theme statements slightly thin the subtext in places.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Time’s duplicity versus light’s truth (“Time Lies, But Light Tells”) threads through object, setting, and tactic, creating cohesive resonance. The con‑man backstory reweights her pursuit with ethical and epistemic stakes beyond mere discovery. The ending’s poised breath invites reflection rather than delivering a tidy moral. Lack of an enacted price keeps the thematic aftershock from reaching the highest register.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance is strong—seeds vs. objects, choice as perforated destiny—and the final image reweights meaning toward silent, patient defiance. Subtext operates through the garden act and the withheld power of performance. However, the explicit statement “destiny wasn’t in objects, but in seeds sown unseen” edges into thematic spelling‑out in the last paragraph, slightly dulling the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Order wrested from entropy (pattern in static) and the dignity of witnessing survival cohere without didacticism. Recurring images (aurora, hush, stone) reweight meaning by the end, avoiding platitudes. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer—preserving a soul as hope—without stating a moral. Slight sentiment risk is contained by specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery (scallops, hairpin, vines) coheres around forgiveness and cyclical renewal, culminating in a reweighted final stance. However, explicit thesis lines—“She would teach others this truth…”—tip into moralizing and reduce subtext. The most resonant beats are the non‑didactic images (hairpin warmed by dawn; vines shedding into stardust). The insight is honest but spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of nuance vs. absolutism emerge through recurring objects and the final exposure image. However, “Nuance wasn’t weakness; it was the only true certainty” leans toward thesis‑statement, softening subtext in the final movement. Much else is earned through image (void → sun‑lit vessel, D natural). The piece invites reflection without confusion but edges close to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—vanishing enables appearing—emerges through image and method (ripples to mirror, grotto’s pulse). However, the piece articulates its thesis directly (“The vanishing is what allows the appearing”), dulling some subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier material without needing an explain-everything coda. Resonance lingers in the conceptual cost of teaching by absence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—listening to the land’s memory; movement through stillness—emerges from particulars (echoes, starlings, arrowhead) and culminates in a quiet, resonant ending. A few explicit lines (“He understood then—”) brush the edge of statement but don’t collapse into sermon. The final image reweights prior material without a neat moral. Subtext runs in the reverent handling and the decision to re-bury the compass.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme (sacred in the simple vs. optimized art) emerges organically through action and image (snowflake’s “stubborn grace,” soft luminance), with a resonant final reweighting. However, a few direct thematic assertions (“The Engines would never comprehend this”; “never again mistake automation for art”) edge toward sermonizing and reduce subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme arises from specifics: vows as absorbed echoes, synesthetic seeing, and the compass’s inward turn—knowledge requiring both darkness and light. The last image reweights prior motifs without over-explanation, though one line (“its compass pointed not north, but inward…”) flirts with on-the-nose. Emotional aftereffect is earned through image and implication rather than sermon. Strong coherence with room for subtler phrasing at the moral edge.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: randomness versus purpose, prophecy reinterpreted through resonance rather than literal meaning. The coins and static become vehicles for a non‑literal answer (purpose as frequency match). However, the closing line “they were its purpose made manifest” tips into explicit thesis stating, blunting subtext. The piece still invites reflection via the prophecy’s reversal and embodied ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of love’s echo, sacrifice, and the disarming power of naming emerge organically through action and image. A near-explicit thesis (“fear loses power when given a name”) risks didacticism but is motivated as Elara’s realization grounded in particulars. The final reweighting—void as a space where light can gather—lingers with earned ambiguity. Subtext runs through the charged objects and the ritual’s cost rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of small, disciplined care against entropy and the dignity of limited power emerge organically from particulars (drips, breath, cracked bronze). The final image reweights the premise—tiny trickle/stars brighter—without moralizing. “Brittle devotion” is dramatized rather than declared, avoiding sentimentality. Slightly more counter‑pressure or irony could deepen ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of remembrance, selective storytelling, and communal duty arise from images and choices, not just assertion. The sapphire shard and resurfacing town shift meaning by the end, tying joy and sorrow. One line edges toward stating the moral, slightly softening ambiguity. Nonetheless the emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—wonder as logic’s ally—is organically seeded through image systems (waterfall prism, Fibonacci spiral) and dramatized by her altered tactic. However, several lines state the thesis too directly (“wonder wasn’t distraction; it was the bridge…”, the grandmother’s aphorism), blunting subtext. The final paragraphs edge toward moralizing summary rather than letting the images alone carry the weight. Still, the closing charged poise resonates beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—trust as a fragile social contract sustained by unseen labor—emerges through action and recurring images (thread, buckle, soundless echo). The “watcher’s burden” risks overstatement but is largely earned by particulars (masked sensor, revised diagnostics, colleague’s drill failure). The final dawn image reweights the night’s labor without sermonizing. A few aphoristic lines (“Trust dies in the gap…”) flirt with didacticism but remain in‑world.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of complementary opposites and personhood-through-connection emerges through action and images (warm palm vs cold fluid, constellated neural light). However, the closing moral statements (“defeating numbness required connection, not control”) are explicit, reducing subtext. The final image of the pulsing brain and settled meadow retains resonance despite the didactic edge.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The corpse flower as disruptive innovation is a coherent, integrated metaphor that returns at the end with his vow and redesign. Some lines state the thesis overtly (“This was the essence of safeguarding space”) rather than letting subtext do the work. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs without a moral summary. Thematic resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of grief as labor, ritual, and transformation emerge organically through concrete acts (macerating leaves into memory‑mist, lullabies becoming wind). “Tending to the unspoken” becomes experiential rather than stated. The ending offers a resonant answer: grief isn’t erased but carried home in a new form. No moralizing; the ambiguity of magic/psychology enriches subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of thresholds over walls emerges organically through action and the final “held breath” image; the pendant’s reweighted light/mist dialogue reframes the premise. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“The boundaries of light weren’t walls...,” “To make friends with uncertainty...”), reducing subtext. Resonance lingers, but subtlety is occasionally surrendered. The closing image still offers a non‑literal answer that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Creative destruction vs. dead faith threads through action, not sermon: he reconfigures a suppressive symbol into a fragile “frozen bloom.” Thematic answer arrives in a non-literal final image that reweights the premise (interruption, not escape). No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (tears freezing, embers, crozier’s irony). The complexity lingers in the chosen fragility of life-in-suspension.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of silence-as-language and cyclical beginnings/ends emerge through action and image (the shard of hush, the gorge mist as carrier). The final realization reweights earlier material without collapsing into moral, though one or two lines verge on explicit statement. Resonance is earned via the tactile ritual of tuning and the recorded “map.” The piece invites reflection more than it asserts.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interconnection, duty within liminality, and constructive hope accrue through concrete motifs (patterns, starlight, hourglass). The final endurance image reframes “emptiness” as potential, offering a quiet repricing. However, a few lines edge toward on‑the‑nose thesis (“Always look for the connections”), trimming subtlety. Resonance lingers but avoids deeper moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme—connection as painful, sinewy labor rather than seamless merging—emerges from concrete acts (weaving with another’s hand) and shifts the final valuation (“not wounds but scars”). Recurring images (thread, hum, flickering illusions) reweight at the end without moralizing. One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“She’d sought connection but ignored its cost”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Edge/threshold imagery accrues into a thematic statement about navigating the unknown, with the chain’s reprise reweighting “unfolded horizons.” The piece occasionally states theme outright (“Balanced curiosity means…”) which blunts subtext. The final image answers the central question non‑literally: expand by mapping the dark’s edges. Resonance lingers through object and environment rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of listening to vulnerable voices and love as protective force emerge through concrete events (the photo’s pointing finger, the caregiver husband recognizing posture). Subtext in “contact tracer for hearts” versus actual lifesaving reframes the vocation. The final line edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly flattening resonance. Nevertheless, the reweighted photograph provides a strong thematic anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, absence, and bearing witness emerge from particulars: the cables’ “remembering,” Vale’s disappearance, and Arden’s vow. Recurring images (gold fleck, crashing hush) reweight meaning at the close. One line edges toward thesis statement, but the resonance mainly arises from action and image. The conceptual repricing of cables as archives deepens the final stance without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of error as aperture and failure as refractive lens emerge organically via mirrored particulars (death glitch vs. corrupted data). The “digital ghost” syncing with heartbeats materializes the human/cosmic bridge. One line flirts with overt statement (“Failure had hidden a bridge...”), but it’s earned by the scene. The final quiet—listening to her heart—carries resonant repricing without a spelled‑out moral.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of preservation, embodiment, and the insufficiency of words emerge organically through tactile soundcraft and the ritual’s outcome. The final image reweights meaning: survival as imprint rather than artifact, a costly, poignant compromise. No sermonizing; resonance is earned through particulars (bone pores, hum, fractured light). The birds’ patterning adds a subtext of communal shaping versus solitary loss.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Resonant themes of grief transmuted to grace and the earth’s playfulness emerge through image and action. However, lines like “The earth isn’t cruel. It’s... playful” and “humanity clung to sorrow as if it were ballast” lean toward thesis articulation, diluting subtext. The final image still reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: reclamation over domination, synchrony over suppression, beauty as living rather than manufactured. The final green sprout reweights the premise without moralizing, shifting the meaning of the statues from guards to anchors. Recurring images (heart rhythm, resonantly soft tone, metal-to-living transformation) accrue subtext. The insight is earned through specific struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hope as contraband and “linking absences” tie theme to concrete action, culminating in a quiet yet resonant final image. The letter’s specifics (“blue tiles”) avoid platitude and give the promise texture. A faint whiff of declared thematics in the “find where broken promises heal” phrasing keeps it just shy of transcendent subtlety. Still, the ending invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme arises organically from mending, ritual, and the fragment’s resonance—silence not as absence but potential—and culminates in action rather than speechifying. The final reprise (he resumes sanding, re‑charged) lands. However, the explicit articulation “silence… becomes the most fertile ground” edges into stated moral, slightly blunting subtext. The imagery otherwise carries the argument effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of analog memory versus digital abstraction, stewardship, and geometry as a lived order emerge organically through action and image. The final reweighting—guardian over seeker—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question without moralizing. Recurring objects (postcard, compass, scarf) deepen subtext without shouty symbolism. Complexity is maintained through quiet ambiguity (miracle felt, not announced) with a clear emotional aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of absence transmuted by the right light and longing becoming action emerge organically through the palette and dawn mechanics. The final repricing—absence as a canvas awaiting light—reweights prior images without resorting to moralizing. Occasional phrasing (“cipher of longing,” “luminous absence”) edges toward declarative theme but remains earned by scene work. The resonance lingers as pursuit replaces stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of fear, longing, and liberation arise through concrete images (vault shaped like a keyhole only longing can open) rather than abstract lecture. The final repricing—courage as freed, not found—resonates and reweights prior material. Slight moralizing creeps into the closing lines (“courage was never lost, only waiting to be unwound”), tempering subtlety. Overall, the imagery carries meaning without heavy authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of preservation vs. theft, ritual/habit, and the gentler truth of guardianship arise from concrete acts and recurring images (constellations, ring). The final repricing (“The witch hadn’t stolen…”) resonates and reweights prior assumptions. A touch of explicit statement trims ambiguity, edging toward telling. The closing breath above the wrecks offers a clean, earned echo without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of exile/mending, redemption through repair, and mentorship’s hard tenderness arise from concrete images (crack vs. shadow, triangle, swing slowing). The final repricing—repair the fracture, not rewind time—lands without moralizing. A couple of explicit lines (“Reversible exile wasn’t just theory…”) edge toward telling but do not derail subtext. Resonance lingers via the warmed shard and the halted backward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres: wonder as communal, cultivated through attention and craft, not force; the pruning/weaving metaphor enacts it. The closing image resonates, but the line “wonder lived in the weave, not the wound” states the thesis outright, tipping into moralizing. Subtext otherwise operates through image (threads of light, cerulean tide). The emotional aftereffect is tender rather than saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Repair, acknowledgment, and grief metabolized into care emerge organically via net/needle/quiet rather than thesis. The lullaby reweights “grounding not graves,” turning silence from dread to balm—an earned, resonant answer. The final steady hush invites reflection without moralizing. Subtext in breath/whisper economy keeps sentimentality at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence reframed as presence emerges organically through action and image (airflow, light shafts, roots sealing/unyielding). The final hum reweights prior details and offers a resonant non‑literal answer about listening and connection across time. The explicit line “Silence is not absence” risks slight didacticism but is plausibly a survey note and earned by the scene. Ambiguity lingers around cost and preservation without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Threads, tension, and “frequency” integrate the physics/letting‑go theme across concrete particulars, culminating in the final refusal. Eleanor’s note articulates the thesis somewhat overtly (“Letting go isn’t breaking; it’s releasing the frequency that binds”), edging into thematic echo. The last image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing beyond that line. Resonance lingers, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of connection-through-art and the ethics of care (protector AI yearning for warmth) emerges from particulars rather than thesis. The final image reweights earlier motifs (bolt plate as key, graffiti as voice) without moralizing. Her reclaimed song answers the ghost’s unspoken needs and her own stasis. Ambiguity lingers productively about ongoing cost and future communion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong thematic coherence—joy as companion to anguish—emerges organically through particulars (auroras, garden-in-ice, mint). Some aphoristic lines from Varek and the closing sentence edge toward overstatement, slightly dulling subtext. The final conceptual repricing (sky as promise) is resonant and reweights prior images. Emotion reads honest rather than saccharine despite a touch of neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.7)
    Core theme—memory held in apparent voids—emerges through action and recurring objects, culminating in “Altocumulus paternalis.” However, explicit thesis lines (“We are never truly gone,” “Empty spaces didn’t just remember; they honored.”) tilt toward moralizing. Subtext is strong in images (condensed lens as sky’s tears) but occasionally overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the impossibility of containment, the dignity of attempt, and human limits. The last lines verge on stating the insight (“mirrored not the sky, but the act of seeking within the limit”) but remain earned by scene pressure. Recurring motifs (touch, fractal precision, hush) transform meaning by the end. Subtext runs through craft and constraint rather than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of perception as discovery and earth/sky reciprocity emerges organically through objects and action. The closing image reweights “stranded luminance” from trap to beacon with quiet emotional payoff. A near‑thesis line (“the next great discovery not of land, but of perception”) edges toward telling. Overall, resonance lingers through image rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of repair as communion emerges organically through prophecy lines (“the space between”) and the tactile act of listening. The final image (a thousand Elaras moving in unison, the library “exhaling”) reweights the piece without sermonizing, though “She hadn't conquered time; she'd learned its song” edges toward explicit. Motifs (driftwood, heart‑gear, mirrors) recur with evolved meaning. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than triumphant, fitting the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Reexamine the roots” refracts as both agronomy and community ethos; the bell/nebula images reweight hope from bramble to bloom. The altruistic ghost frames a theme of trust and collective effort without sermonizing. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: respite is made through concert, not miracle alone. Slight sentimentality is contained by concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Resonances—“beautifully flawed,” comfort as repair, pattern as hope—accrue through objects and acts rather than exposition. The final images reweight the premise (prismed beam, bird’s chirp, puppet eye as universe) with genuine pathos. A mild tilt toward overt statement (“because he had chosen to believe in the melody”) dulls subtlety at the last inch. Still, the thematic aftereffect is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Duty vs. graceless care, guidance through absence, and the possibility that saving others may loosen a curse interlock without sermonizing. The “whispering the way” method and the frosted nut reprise deepen the theme. The final wonder reframes the premise with conceptual cost (her soul’s bind) rather than pat answers. Resonance is earned through particulars, not declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Separation-to-connection is woven through water braids, foam bonds, chrysalis, and self-healing polymers, culminating in a resonant recoding of loss. Subtext and image largely carry the theme, though some lines tip into overt statement (“His atonement wouldn’t be punishment; it would be purpose.”). The final vibration/laugh note avoids sentimentality while providing lift. Thematic integration is strong, if a touch spelled-out.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of absence-as-origin versus erasure emerges organically through objects, action, and the final beam, with strong motif integration. Subtext is carried in the inversion—light illuminating beyond the void—rather than a stated moral. However, a couple explicit statements (“slates were lies”) nudge into on-the-nose territory, slightly reducing afterglow ambiguity. The ending still resonates as a reweighted answer to the opening question.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of transforming private guilt into communal tenderness emerges organically via concrete acts (tasting, boiling, serving). Recurring images (tidal pools as recipe, sandpaper, brittle/sturdy) reweight meaning at the end without sermonizing. One line edges on-the-nose (“This was the work she’d crossed deserts for...”), but overall the resonance is earned. The closing clarity image conceptually reprices regret without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of communal reconnection via sound emerges organically from action and the final chorus of clock/elevator/farmers. The “bridges from silos” motif is strong, though the line “Bridges from silos weren’t metaphors” flirts with on‑the‑nose statement. The multilingual prayer and tactile repair earn the insight rather than assert it. The final image offers resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Resonance emerges through particulars (meadow laughter, toxic sky, desert garden) rather than abstract sermonizing. One explicit theme line (“his transformation was not just personal, but a duty…”) edges toward telling, but the final image reweights meaning without a moral. The mirror’s revaluation from loss to conduit supports a humane thesis about salvaging hope. Ambiguity remains where it should: beauty persists amid failure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    “Vigilance as seed → blaze” is a coherent throughline, and the final image (carrying light into the city) resonates. Some lines verge on stating the thesis (“This knowledge was not just to be kept; it was to be sown”), which dulls subtext. The theme emerges from events but occasionally leans into moralizing rather than letting images carry it. Still, the reprise of motifs earns a satisfying conceptual reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action: empathy as technique transforms damage into notation, turning flaw into voice. The final chord and whispered thanks reprice “silence” as listenable rather than empty, without moralizing. Recurrences (insulator as empathy conductor, stress cracks as scale) culminate in a resonant answer. The siskins’ tentative chirps embody communal re‑voicing, deepening the afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Chess as a grammar for truth and vows, and eclipse as concealment rather than rupture, converge into a thoughtful, resonant theme. Recurring images (stone, alignment, silence) reweight meaning at the end. A few explicit theme lines (“The game was never about winning...”) approach moralizing and slightly thin the subtext. Still, the closing gesture (returning at dawn not for reinstatement) lands an earned, quiet answer.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of empathy and silence emerge organically from objects, actions, and her practiced listening. The diary line about silence and breath is a potent image that reweights prior material. A touch of explicit moralizing (“For empathy had been recovered…”) slightly flattens subtext in the final third. Overall resonance lingers through the final shared‑awe image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme emerges convincingly from particulars—the seed’s “metallic whisper,” the beam’s undercurrent, her shift from forcing to receiving. However, the line “Serenity wasn’t imposed stillness; it was the calm found within the sway” states the thesis overtly, softening subtext at the peak. The final image (leaf pulsing with the platform’s sway) still resonates and reweights prior material. Complexity is present but slightly moralized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of resilience as gathered memory emerges organically from water/stone echoes and the arrow’s failure‑turned‑tuning fork. The final paragraph edges into direct thesis (“resilience wasn’t found—it was gathered”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the image chain (inversion → echoes → accelerated growth) sustains resonance. Thematic coherence is strong if a bit declared.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of foresight versus unpredictability and making the unseen legible emerge through particulars (vortices, measurement, the patch). The closing vow reweights the earlier technical detail into ethical purpose without sermonizing. A few explicit lines flirt with stating theme, but the images carry the weight. The patch’s reprise supplies quiet, earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic cohesion is strong but over‑declared; lines like “This was the truth: wonder is essential, as vital as breath” and “Without it, humanity was a hollow shell” state the moral outright. The images (sculpted hush, spent amber) could have carried the theme without sermonizing, especially in the final third. The concept does achieve a conceptual repricing, but the explicit moral dampens subtext and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (control vs harmony/listening) emerges from action and charged images (tarnished covenant, swallowed note), and the final stance reweights prior material. However, “true guardianship required surrender, not command” edges into thesis articulation, dulling subtext in the final movement. Still, the last image of listening restores resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through image and choice: the impulse to measure feeling yields to an ethic of carriage and stewardship. The collective sigh sequence reweights the premise without needing didactic resolution, though the line “Emotion wasn’t a solvable equation” edges close to overt thesis. The halo fragment’s refiguration at the end converts tool to reminder, giving resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory vs. myth and wonder as a disciplined act emerge organically from object and action, not sermon. The final image reweights the journey—auroras as witnesses—without mechanistic moralizing. One line edges toward overt statement (“This was what Vanya meant...”), tilting slightly declarative. Still, the piece earns its insight through the concrete flower moment and the mentor’s absence as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—observer projection versus objective truth—emerges through concrete particulars (frost ciphers, prism’s “memories”) and culminates in a resonant reweighting, not a stated moral. “Truthful lies” recurs as a tonal motif that the final image re‑interprets with humility. The ending invites reflection without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sacrifice, remembrance, and communication across time accrue through objects and images rather than thesis statements. The bead’s final ascension reweights “raveling silence” into a price-paid release, not a platitude. Complexity holds without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Resilience, silence transformed into a different kind of defiance, and communal healing arise from concrete images rather than moralizing. The final image reweights the motif of “azure defiance,” turning it from fungi’s glow to the world’s new pulse. The barter reframes meekness as an active power with cost. A few near-declarative phrases flirt with stating the thesis but stay anchored to scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of sacrifice versus pursuit of truth emerges from concrete images (the shard warming then going ice‑cold; Lyra’s hand into the field). The ending reweights “map‑making” into an ethical compass without sermonizing, though one line edges toward articulation. Subtext flows through sensation and charged objects rather than thesis. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of stewardship, communal safety, and memory-as-infrastructure emerge organically through letters, stones, and the “promise” of the light. The final image (“a lighthouse of the soul”) reweights the premise without tipping into sermon, though it brushes the edge of overt statement. Subtext in the chain of anonymous caretakers and the tactile rituals avoids platitude. Resonance lingers as obligation chosen over powerlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Resonant theme of mending through “brokenness” and “shadows” emerges from action and the final reweighting of scattered beams into strength. The “last print newspaper” obits add mortality and duty, not just color. One line edges toward explicit statement (“using brokenness to mend, shadows to illuminate”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the final image refracts the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres through action and image: “iridescent caution” becomes a lived stance—holding space rather than grasping. The wing’s reprise and the final exchange with the child deliver a resonant, non‑literal answer. Slight deduction for the donor’s journal stating the thesis rather directly, which edges toward didactic clarity. Nevertheless, the closing image lingers with charged implication.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (sextant, rings, ledger, moon) braid into a coherent meditation on sorrow as witnessed connection. However, the explicit line “Quantified sorrow wasn’t a measure of loss, but of connection” tips into thesis-stating and slightly dulls the subtext. The final image still resonates—a working tool, a charged oak, ongoing tending. The piece earns its quiet wisdom through particulars despite a touch of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of community, memory, and care (“swaddling”) emerge through images and actions, not moralizing; the final image reprices “dawn” as embrace rather than spectacle. The mica window and threads accrue meaning toward a communal reconnection that meets hers. One explicatory line (“Dawn wasn’t just light; it was a protective embrace”) risks stating the thesis, but it’s integrated as POV realization and earns payoff. Resonance lingers without tidy sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of imperfect wisdom and connection through cracks recur via the crumpled invitation and inscription, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the thesis is articulated rather directly in-text (“The greatest mistake…”; “Her mistake wasn’t her empathy…”), edging toward didactic. Despite this, the reweighting of “staying/ leaving” lands. Subtext lives more in image than in dialogue, which suits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through motifs (bread, birds, seeds, locket) without sermonizing, with the host’s single line adding subtext rather than declaring a moral. The ending reweights prior material—the seed/waiting image answers the sacred‑ordinary question with lived tenderness. Complexity holds: absolution is tenuous and costly, not a cure‑all. The image‑driven resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Memory versus oblivion, and promise as measurable light, emerge through particulars (741 Hz as “promise,” grief/resolve harmonics) rather than thesis. The final seed of hope reframes the tomb‑library and resonates without moralizing. One line edges toward told theme (“This number was not just data; it was the vow’s soul”) but the surrounding scene earns it. Ambiguity remains purposeful: preservation as vow renewed, not victory declared.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of trust, hush, and betrayal emerge through event and image (collective intake of breath, “hush before the storm”) rather than sermonizing. The father’s death hour and the fob’s cold weight modulate meaning at the end, yielding a resonant repricing of “truth” vs cost. One line edges toward direct thesis (“Listen for the hush…”), but it’s earned by the scene and primes the closure. The final walk into dawn sustains ambiguity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stewardship, memory, and symbiosis accrue through concrete images (mycorrhizal elections, weather-souls) and converge at the nexus. The final line risks explicit thesis (“someone had to remember how to hold the sky”), but the earned imagery largely supports it. Subtext about human responsibility sits beneath the lyric surface without heavy sermonizing elsewhere. Resonance lingers conceptually more than emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of repair, inheritance, and answering an inescapable vocation emerge through objects and acts (numbers, lock, painting/behind). The final shift—from sorrow as prison to crucible—offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior images. One explicit thesis line about “a test” edges toward telling, slightly reducing subtextual power. Overall, resonance is earned through particulars rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—connection restored through truth rather than extraction—is dramatized through the assembly method and the Archive’s logic, not moralized. The final image (“She didn’t wilt. She bloomed.”) reweights earlier material without telling us what to think. The zinc/route system ties honesty to infrastructure, giving the idea teeth. Minimal sermonizing; complexity remains in the cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—truth made tactile and communal when language fails—emerges through particulars (wind/metal, body-felt music, children’s silent laughter). The final image reweights the premise: the community carries color “in their bones,” implying durable, nonverbal transmission. A few lines edge toward telling (“This was the color of wonder Elara fought to preserve”) but mostly the images do the work. The resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motifs (static, fears in the box, controlled containment) converge into a resonant revaluation of nostalgia as guidance. Subtext largely rides image and action—the empty box and seedlike roses imply integration of fear. However, the line “Nostalgia wasn’t a flaw—it was the compass that guided him home” states the thesis too directly, dulling the otherwise strong image-led resonance. Without that explicit moral, the ending would linger more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Images and actions embody the theme (listening as communal repair), but the final paragraphs state it overtly (“This simple act of listening… was the strongest thread”), tipping toward moralizing. Subtext does operate in the crowd’s tears and Rajan’s letter, which could stand alone. The resonance is genuine yet dulled by explicit thesis restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability becomes strength by being integrated into method (the dance keyed to fear, Thorne’s philosophy enacted). Recurring images (spider web, dice, water) shift meaning at the end, charging the cradle-of-resilience image. No moralizing; the final cadence invites reflection. A hair of explicit phrasing (“encrypt vulnerability as strength”) edges toward statement but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of keeping vs theft in memory and grief emerges organically from the salt lattice and the mother/whale parallels. The recurring wildflowers shift meaning from relic to key to release. The line “weren’t thieves but keepers” edges toward a thesis statement but the scene work earns it. The final luminous image invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silence as craft and ethic—“mapping silence,” “liquid silence,” “contained within the flow”—organically fuses theme with action. The “terrestrially cosmic” motif reframes harmony between earth and stars without sermonizing, and the final earned stillness reweights the earlier imagery. Resonance persists via the spent wing/altar and the charged promise of her continued watch. The piece avoids tidy moralizing while offering a clear experiential answer.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: ritual tea, tactile objects, and the city’s “language” reframed as a shared pact. Subtext in Mrs. Thorne’s care and Vale’s curatorial myth gives the piece emotional honesty without sentimentality. The letter and the line “Guard the silence between the lies” land as resonant, if a touch explicit. The final cadence reweights prior images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of transformation vs. erasure and physics entwined with longing emerge organically from the ritual’s particulars. The final images (buried shell, softened glow) resonate. A couple of explicit statements (“not erasure, but transformation,” “elegant physics of healing”) tilt toward telling and trim the lingering ambiguity. Still, the emotional aftertaste is earned and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of restorative justice, inherited guilt, and forgiveness over vengeance emerge through concrete acts and charged objects. The thorn, chrysanthemum mark, and “calibrated treason” braid into a coherent moral calculus. One line edges toward thesis (“Forgiving the unfinished meant...”), but it’s supported by scene work rather than replacing it. The ending’s extinguished candle and aurora pulse offer a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice vs. silence, truth vs. control, and bloodline as “curse/bridge” emerge from concrete beats, not sermon. The lullaby/echo motif shifts from memory to insurgent method, reweighting the ending. Renn’s exposition edges close to thematic stating, but the final image (“She would sing. And the canyon would answer.”) earns resonance. Ambiguity around the spirits and the Council’s motives leaves productive space.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete motifs: purity vs wreckage, truth’s weave, windows of connection, and communal guilt. The final image reweights every prior detail (the globe as promise) without sermonizing. Subtext—collective lie, a father’s last clean thought—operates through implication and image rather than declarations. The resonance is earned, lingering on complicity and mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of hidden labor is organically threaded through nets, fireflies, architecture, and tea; the fortress’s “song” mirrors the net-mender’s unseen hours. Subtext operates in the ritualized brewing not for consumption but acknowledgment—a non-literal answer. A few explicit statements verge on moralizing (“true strength, like true beauty…”) blunting some resonance. Overall, the final image lingers with earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece interrogates engineered “miracles,” institutional sacrifice, and myth as control; the flawed diamond’s revaluation neatly embodies the theme. Some lines verge on thesis (“The comfortable lies were a dam…”), trimming subtext. The last image—returning the stone and walking into the storm—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Thematic complexity is credible if not daring.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around “balance of light and dark,” power through shadow versus destructive purity, and the peril of false shepherds; it emerges through action and charged images. The Portico’s reweighted meaning at the end (“deep, protective violet”) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. A few lines verge on declarative neatness (“Dawn is woven”), slightly smoothing complexity. Still, the afterimage is earned and reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory, inheritance, and small salvations accrue through objects and acts. The final jar of the child’s hum is a concrete, resonant answer to the translator ambition. One explicit line (“Gleaned redemption… wasn’t grand absolution”) edges toward telling but is grounded by the scene around it. Subtext in silence and offering carries the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: harmony as salvation, the union of math and spirit, protection of fragile systems. The final pure tone reweights prior images without moralizing and delivers a resonant answer. A few on‑the‑nose phrases (“sonic absolution,” “fragility”) flirt with statement but are earned by the concrete struggle. Subtext of stewardship and care emerges through action rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres: patience as power, fear as brittle chain, revolution as cultivated memory. Subtext is carried by image (moon’s path, magnetism after rain) and the collective stillness that unyokes. Occasional thesis‑forward lines (“We unyoke them not with force…”) flirt with didacticism, softening subtlety. The last image reweights prior material without a spelled‑out moral.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of legacy, institutional erasure, and ethical refusal emerge through recurring images (lantern, reverberation, wet vs. drought) and culminate in a reweighted final image. The Underground Railroad lineage reframes her procedural act as historical continuance. Occasional explicitness (“This time, she would…”) skews slightly declarative but doesn’t flatten resonance. The end’s flicker‑without‑waver lands as earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of forgiveness, deserving, and turning apology into action emerge from particulars (repair as mending, “second opinion” mirrored in metal and men). The final repricing—“Tell Father Mike he deserves peace too”—reweights prior material effectively. A few lines veer toward on‑the‑nose moralizing (“She’ll hear him now. That’s what she deserves.”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Overall, resonance lingers without resorting to abstract sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic through‑line—translating human longing into mechanism until recognizing the irreducible—emerges organically. The final repricing (“The bell wasn’t meant to be heard; it was meant to be broken”) risks slight on‑the‑nose framing but is supported by the image of singing shards raining harmlessly. Recurring motifs (arrow, kaleidoscope, acid sea) refract the theme instead of stating it. The piece leaves resonant ambiguity about creation vs. surrender without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Memory as consumption, institutional erasure, and grief’s “sensed absence” braid coherently; the final image reweights the premise. Some theme lines are on‑the‑nose (“The archive doesn’t delete... it consumes memories”), trimming subtext. The patch and numbers motif earn resonance by the end. Reflection emerges from events rather than sermonizing, aside from a couple thesis‑like sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of empathy operationalized into communal action is integrated through plot and images (shared patrols, joint signals, lanterns). Subtext functions via the mirror motif reweighting fractured time into present repair. However, the explicit thesis line “Courage wasn’t the absence of fracture…” reads as moralizing in the final paragraph, dulling earned resonance. Despite that, the closing images retain a lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of patience, surrender, and grace within endings emerge through recurrent sound images and the parasol’s reweighted meaning. The line “Endings weren't heralded by a single sound...” nudges toward telling, but it’s earned by prior particulars. The final distant calving delivers a non‑literal answer with lingering resonance. Subtext runs in the wind/ice acoustics rather than speech.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme coheres—harshness refining sweetness; edges burned yet core intact—and the final image reweights prior details. However, explicit statements (“By drawing parallels, the truth emerged… the mismatch was the crucible, not the end.”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. The strongest moments are image‑led (the letter as seed; amber rows as shared horizon). A quieter inference would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of unity, memory versus forgetting, and truth’s fragility arise from concrete actions (alignment with deeper machinery, consecration through stillness). Subtext is carried by environment and method rather than declared moralizing. The final image reweights the opening—truth preserved as living resonance, not mere memory. Complexity persists without forced symmetry or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres through recurrent images and acts of witness; the final image reaffirms communal repair without didactic summary. One explicit thesis line (“Healing… wasn’t solitary”) edges into telling but is buffered by concrete moments (Mrs. Gupta’s sprig, the jersey, the photo arcs). Subtext surfaces in the empty case and the absent photo’s gift. Resonance lingers, if a touch declared.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—language as living, evolving beyond static authority—emerges through particulars (fractured echoes reweigh definitions). The final image (“dust motes danced like scattered letters”) offers a non‑literal answer: hope via a new epistemology, not a thesis statement. Librarian skepticism and the tomb/cathedral tension provide subtext without sermonizing. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—aging as an erosive, nearly inaudible process—emerges through specific sonic and material images rather than moralizing. “Clinging to echoes wasn’t metaphor here; it was survival” reframes the premise in-scene and is later repriced by the final forgetful wipeout. The last image (fog swallowing the plink and markers) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about memory’s attrition. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around transience and acceptance, with the leaf, clock, and seismic harmonics reframing “escape velocity.” The final image reweights earlier motifs without sentimentality, delivering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Slight explicitness in stating the thesis (“escape velocity wasn’t about…”) trims subtlety. Overall, subtext carries through image more than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: release vs. grasping, memory as bridge, sacredness in the mundane. The “scent of hope” and the vinyl shard shift from symbols to instruments of reconfiguration; no explicit moral intrudes. The final image reweights prior details without sermonizing. Ambiguity is purposeful yet resonant, inviting reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of knowledge over force, grief reframed as stewardship, and “within not away” accrue organically from action and image. The spoon motif and loop mechanics reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final pairing of key and shadow‑shard resonates. Slightly more tension between personal ache and planetary duty on the page might deepen ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of fracture, acceptance, and transmutation are integrated through recurring images (cleft, bone setting, constellations, maze/ivy). The final image reweights prior material without requiring a spelled‑out moral. A few overt statements (“Mistakes… weren’t dead ends but pivot points”) flirt with didacticism but don’t derail resonance. Subtext in Finn’s questions and the Hemlock metaphor is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of remembered light, inheritance, and stillness as vessel accrues through particulars and culminates in a non‑literal answer: warmth without consumption, grief transmuted into guidance. The grandmother’s maxim is integrated, not sermonized, and the closing image reweights earlier motifs. Some lines verge on stating the thesis, but they are supported by scene work. Resonance lingers without cheap uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Recurring images (moss, data decay, icicle fractal, amber) converge into a nuanced meditation on transforming wounds into bridges. The thematic line “Some wounds… held up to the light” verges on thesis statement and slightly over‑clarifies what the images already carry. Still, the final image reweights prior material with emotional honesty. Ambiguity persists productively—connection is chosen, not guaranteed.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—witnessing vs possession under mortality—emerges from ritual acts, failures, and the shell’s limits; the spiral motif reweights at the end. One explicit articulation of thesis (“meant to be witnessed, not hoarded”) is a touch on‑the‑nose, but the closing images do the heavier lifting. Emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental. Ambiguity remains in the cost of release.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory as remedy and communal ritual restoring land emerge through concrete acts (song as technology; lineage via the grandfather’s token). Subtext resides in the land’s “memory” awakened by story‑threads taking root. However, the line “stories are the truest harvest” articulates the thesis overtly in the final movement, undercutting otherwise earned resonance. The piece invites reflection but tips toward moralizing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Memory as safekept starlight evolves from motif to lived action—translating heartbeats into maps becomes a literal, tender craft. The final image reweights loss as preserved luminosity without moralizing. The storybook plate’s reprise and the earth’s pulse integrate subtext (private ritual rebinding self to a dead world). Thematic complexity lingers in the tension between containment and absence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: reason as a vessel for wonder, memory embedded in matter, and grief transformed into kept resonance. The closing act reframes “harvest the echo, not the sound” into an ethic of keeping what can be kept. Recurring images (light angles, prisms, resonance) accrue meaning without moralizing. Sentiment is restrained; the glow in the vial delivers the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thematic weave of consequence, grief, and transmutation (calcify/soften) accrues through particulars. The ending reweights prior images—the lamp as companion, burdens as craft material—without moralizing. The “fractal weaver” premise ties choices to consequence with conceptual bite. Ambiguity lingers productively around whether collection redeems or perpetuates the curse.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Transformation through craft and the “here and gone” motif recur and are reweighted by the ending image. Subtext mostly rides gestures and objects (shavings like memories), with a few lines tipping into thesis statement. The final cadence resonates, though the explicit moral trims ambiguity. Overall, theme arises from enacted particulars rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of attention vs. erasure, survival vs. art, and the price of looking away emerge from particulars (film strips of regrets, “traded my song for safety”). The refrain “It only stops if you look away” recontextualizes the carousel and her career choices without sliding into moralizing. The final image earns a melancholic repricing of permanence and loss. A hair shy of transcendent because the aphorism edges close to stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of resilience and rechanneling competing intentions accrue through concrete acts (redirected geothermal energy, repurposing mirrors). The sextant’s reprise and the hum/stellar mirror image reweight prior material without needing a thesis. Occasional explicit statements (“Hope…functionally creative acts”) edge toward summary, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance lingers through image rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance arises from concrete particulars (bear, orrery, dawn) and the final reweighting is credible. However, the explicit articulation (“never meant to be built, but to be the journey itself”) edges into thesis, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the imagery carries an honest aftertaste and avoids mawkishness. The theme coheres with character and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: truth versus myth, media complicity, and capital’s sleight‑of‑hand. The sundial’s refiguring from mystical object to survey tool is a strong thematic pivot that lingers. A few lines edge toward thesis (“capital dressed theft in wonder”), but the closing image—sundial as compass toward justice—carries resonance without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection beyond its scene.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of stewardship, labor as language, and time’s concealment emerge through rope‑work rather than moralizing. The ending reweights earlier images (fulgurite as “fossilized storm,” rope as archive) into a vow that honors method over spectacle. The piece invites reflection on preservation versus loss without tidy pronouncements. Subtext hums in the physical act of copying knots as a way to carry wisdom forward.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of loss, witnessing, and cartography arise organically from concrete acts (thread ritual, obituary revisions). The final repricing—healing as presence to absence—reweights prior images without collapsing into a moral. One explicit question (“What if healing wasn’t a destination…”) flirts with thesis‑speak but remains anchored by scene pressure. The closing charged poise lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic throughline—beauty vs. mechanized sterility; flawed genesis vs. persistence—emerges from concrete particulars (moss under egg, stuttering chirp) and culminates in a resonant final image. The reprise (“beauty reawakened… but broken”) risks slight overstatement but remains earned. Ambiguity lingers productively: triumph and grief coexist. No sermonizing, but a hair more subtext in place of the explicit labels would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic throughline (scars as song; renewal from ash) is integrated via specific images (black sand as bridge, graft as prayer). However, several lines verge on explicit moral statement (“Scars didn’t just heal—they harmonized”), trimming subtext. The father’s platitude reappears with earned reinterpretation, but sentiment occasionally edges into declaration. The final image resonates, if a touch on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Memory as water and patience as method interweave without thesis‑telling; images (geese pause, box emptied, water rising) reweight earlier material. The ending’s quiet hope feels earned rather than sentimental. The skeptic’s transformation is a resonance rather than a speech. Complexity lives in the paradox of “realistically imaginative” action that treats wonder as craft.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of non‑destructive stewardship, generational repair, and retooling wartime tech into care arise organically through objects and action. The grandmother’s garden echo reweights legacy with a nuanced answer: quiet endurance over spectacle. The recorded line risks explicitness, but the final image (“light for generations unborn”) earns resonance through particulars. No sermonizing override; ambiguity lingers in the “troubling serenity.”

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme arises organically from ritual, craft, and migration—memory living in “space between” lines and wings—culminating in the charged vessel image. The Neruda/Dickinson/Rilke threads weave a non‑literal answer without overexplaining. A slight on‑the‑nose tilt comes via Corvin’s explicit thesis statement, but the scene work carries the resonance. The afterimage lingers as communal remembrance versus monumentalization.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of incremental absolution emerges through concrete particulars: inscriptions as calibration, craft as atonement, “shared balance” embodied in a working clock. The closing reweights earlier images without sermonizing, though a few lines verge on stating thesis (“restore shared balance”). The rake handle’s “now” delivers a resonant, earned repricing of the ritual. Ambiguity remains human and lived, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of remembrance, intention‑as‑map, and caretaking emerge organically from action and image. The final vow reweights earlier material (the cemetery’s quiet becomes charged with “echoes of intentions”). No sermonizing; resonance lingers through specific objects and acts rather than abstract claims.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of constraint as generative force and imagination tethered to truth recur through concrete motifs (ice cores, kingfisher, quill). The final poised image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: transformation requires risk and precision. Some lines tilt into thesis‑speak (“The realm needed more than a thaw…”) that tell what the images already carry, softening subtlety. Still, the kingfisher’s return reframes hope credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, testimony, and restoration emerge organically through the craft of transcription and the reanimation of dust. Recurring images (blue glow, dust, ember, mist) accrue meaning and reweight at the end without sermonizing. One explicit line (“Not for rebellion, but for restoration”) edges toward statement but is grounded by scene work. The final image—dust as voice—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the famine’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme integrates through objects and action—mask, vanishing lines, flood losses—culminating in a repricing of permanence vs. transient love. Subtext largely carries the weight, though a few lines state thesis openly (“Safety had been a story…”). The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: a transient truth held briefly, at cost. The motif net tightens rather than sprawls.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Competing narratives and the ethics of preservation arise through concrete images (strata, cog) and culminate in a resonant last gesture. Yet the theme occasionally speaks itself (“Easier to burn books than learn the tide tables,” “Rationally rebellious”), edging into didacticism. Subtext exists in Kael’s doubt but is undercut by explicit statements. The final image rebalances meaning without quite escaping the thesis voiced earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subtracting‑noise conceit bridges artifact and ethics, letting theme emerge through concrete practice and final imagery. “Vanishing arts” refracts beyond instruments into the endangered craft of empathy, reweighted by the closing silence. A few explicit lines (“True harmony begins in the space we clear”) lean toward moralizing, blunting subtext’s autonomy. Overall, resonance endures due to the rosette’s charged reprise and the library’s purposeful hush.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of reclamation, embodied memory, and hope as labor arise through concrete acts and sensory echoes (bitter jasmine grief → blackberry joy → resilience). The final image reweights the premise without a didactic bow. Occasional explicit framing (“quiet revolution,” “how to heal without a single shout”) leans toward statement over subtext. Overall resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—attention as quiet magic, truth as costly duty—emerges from particulars (the matchbox reinterpreted as diagnostic, her compulsion). However, the line “the truth—and the quiet magic of paying attention—had kept the light alive” edges into stated thesis, diminishing subtext in the final beat. The riddle’s reweighting is strong and almost carries the resonance alone.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—care sanctifies the ordinary; homes are held by displaced traces of love—emerges through concrete acts and charged objects. The last paragraphs risk overt statement (“The living ones weren’t haunted; they were held”), slightly flattening the subtext. Nonetheless, the Finnegan pulse and the orris root’s quieting deliver earned resonance beyond a tidy moral. The piece invites reflection on ritual, grief, and attention without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of nuance versus certainty are integrated through action (mending by embracing fracture) and images (woven light), culminating in a resonant final image. However, lines like “To welcome nuance into a certainty” state the thesis overtly, reducing subtextual power. The repricing of Atlantis’s fall is compelling but bordered by didactic phrasing. The aftereffect lingers more by image than by the declared moral.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (flaws as engines of motion; the ethics of hesitation vs. escape) emerges from event and image, not just assertion, and reweights at the end. The chipped/perfect dice and perpetual motion motifs evolve meaningfully. A couple of thesis‑y lines edge toward didacticism, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. The final renunciation resonates without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—memory as communal resource carried in language—emerges through particulars (Nahuatl “Niciyotl,” the commuter’s tactile recognition) rather than thesis. The ending image reweights the premise: one smile justifies continued acts, resisting tidy moralizing. Motifs (moonlight, soot, greenhouse) echo without strain. The piece invites reflection on urban amnesia and quiet repair without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically: displacement, the fragility of memory, and ritual transformed into survival. The bread‑letters’ repurposing reweights heritage from remembrance to action without sermonizing. “Rosewater dread” shifts from perfume of nostalgia to an embodied pressure, deepening resonance. Ambiguity remains (tonight saved, tomorrow uncertain), inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic integration is strong: rebellion shifts from a backward imitation to a tuning that hears time’s “hidden music.” The hunger stone’s radiance as memory/consequence reframes agency as charged, not escapist; the final image embraces possibility with fear intact. No moralizing undercuts the resonance. The ambiguity feels purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres: acknowledgment disarms fear, and paradox turns weakness into leverage. Recurring images (luminance, mirrors, the camera) evolve in meaning and culminate in a reweighted final image. Some thematic lines are on‑the‑nose (“Fear had revealed its weakness: it could not survive the light of acknowledgment”), trimming subtext. Still, the insight grows from concrete ordeal rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic thread—turning obstacle into instrument—emerges organically through enacted craft, not lecture. The closing images (sea breathing in tune; silence turned to possibility) reweight the premise with a quiet, resonant cadence. A few explicit articulations (“a testament to turning dread into music”) edge toward stating the thesis. Even so, the imagery-driven subtext largely carries the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of language, resonance, and the ethics of inquiry emerge organically via image (spirals, lichen trails, wind paths) rather than thesis. The final shift—from watchers as passive to waiting—reweights the entire premise with unease. No moralizing; the city’s complicity adds ambiguity and lingering charge. The reprise of the whistle aligns insight with risk.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of noble lies, generational cost, and beauty as cover emerge through recurring objects (illuminated letter as “mirror,” rosebush thorns) and a historian’s praxis. Some lines tip into explicit moralizing (“proving that even well‑intentioned falsehoods...”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior material without needing a didactic moral, though the thesis is stated outright once or twice. Overall resonance is solid with earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Memory versus loss is dramatized through concrete acts, culminating in the charged act of sealing the past back into the structure. The watercolor packet transforms “interlaced absence” into a tangible presence, reweighting prior images. One line over-explains theme (“Interlaced absence wasn’t just emptiness”), shaving subtlety. Still, the final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of authenticity, institutional mythmaking, and restoration over correction emerge organically from concrete acts. “Reclaimed stillness” functions as both condition and ethic, reweighted by the ending heartbeat‑like stamp. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“Reclaimed stillness wasn’t just the absence of noise...”), but they’re supported by scene work. The open‑circle mark elegantly frames recontextualization without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—art as transmutation of grief; love and loss on one spectrum—emerges through concrete acts, not just assertion. The lantern’s lavender light reframing the dream offers a resonant, non‑literal answer and reweights cranes from grief to hope. One line states the thesis a bit directly, but it’s earned by the scene’s specifics. Ambiguity remains (she climbs again), avoiding tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of grief, stolen futures, and the ethics of channeling latent potential emerge from particulars and culminate in a resonant reweighting (map/stabilize pools rather than revive the past). The geode as love‑conduit ties idea to image effectively. A few explicit thesis lines (“He understood the hunt’s purpose…”) shave subtlety. Still, the ending’s image earns reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Belonging as frequency emerges through objects and sound, not mere assertion; the final hum/lullaby reweights prior images. The motif set (chip, broken rings, star trails) evolves into thematic answer: she is the missing piece. A single on‑the‑nose line (“This was the frequency of belonging”) trims subtlety. Overall resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Complicity, revisionist memory, and the ethics of erasure emerge through concrete particulars, not thesis. The recurring “sieved hush” and the watch hand reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer—no more falsehoods—anchored in cost. Ambiguity about Elara’s fate supports, not muddies, the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of apology, forgiveness, and salvage accrue through concrete images rather than thesis-talk, culminating in the reweighted drawer pull. The ending refuses neat absolution, landing on charged poise that invites reflection. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“recycle mistakes into wisdom”), but they’re earned by the particulars. Subtext in silence and gesture works well.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of atonement and choosing presence emerge through images and action (compass vs poles, clouds vs sliver of sun), not just assertion. The ending reweights earlier motifs without a moral lecture, though phrases like “utility poles of obligation” edge toward explicit thesis. The resonance lingers in the charged decision and the reconfigured tools.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from action: choosing “light” as sacrifice over expediency, with the final image reframing redemption as shared ascent. The baseball’s reweighted meaning and the lake’s delicate/robust paradox reinforce empathy’s fragility and resilience. Occasional explicitness (“beyond saving,” “irredeemable waste”) edges toward thesis, but the scene earns its insight. The closing charged poise lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically from cycles, scent, and memory; “reluctant metamorphosis” is dramatized rather than preached. The final image reweights all prior material, answering the central question with acceptance over reversal. Symbols (moonlight, spices) shift meaning at the end without heavy‑handedness. The emotional aftereffect is clear and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of repair, presence, and the revaluation of “lost time” arise from concrete action (ink sealing the crack; hand tracings merging). A strong closing image reweights prior motifs; the mended objects become lived doctrine. However, the line “Cloudbound repentance wasn’t about erasing absence but embracing presence” tips into explicit moralizing, blunting subtext. Despite that, resonance remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises through particulars: compassion as action, liberation through integration, and grief transmuted into tool and passage. The ending reweights the premise—“mended the unbroken”—without didactic moralizing; images (dry photographs, released sigh of the ship) carry the answer. Complexity remains: pacifism is preserved but reframed against a cost. Subtext in objects (Kwan Yin’s tear, ancestors’ tears) deepens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—transformation as small, luminous acts—is woven through recurring images (bottles, hush, alignment) and culminates in a reweighted self-conception. However, several lines state the moral outright (“even in destitution, generosity could ignite hope”; “not by magic… but because coincidence, kindness…”), blunting subtext, especially near the end. The best moments let image do the work (freed firefly calming a toddler; tremors easing with his quiet labor). Resonance lingers but avoids true complexity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of light vs. silence and knowledge vs. surveillance emerge through concrete images (half‑painted sundial, “angles where light forgets to fall”). The final image reweights the motif—“whisper, then blaze”—without moralizing. Subtext of lineage and suppressed scholarship subtly deepens stakes. Some symbolism edges toward explicit statement in mentor’s maxim but still earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of observer effect, control vs flow, and seeking over finding arise organically from action and reprise in the ending image. The curse-as-compass turn effectively reweights earlier material without feeling schematic. A small deduction for a slightly declarative line (“Understanding wasn't a destination...”) that skirts moralizing. The final image still retains ambiguity and resonance beyond the stated insight.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of silence, scars as cartography, and truth in pauses emerge organically through objects and ritual. However, the final articulated thesis line (“We are the constellations we survive”) veers into explicit moral, softening subtextual power. Elara’s message risks didacticism but is integrated with action. The resonance still lingers via the reweighted motifs and charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (clarity over violence; questions into destinations) emerges through action and recurring images (sundial, brook, overture). The final line leans a touch declarative, risking mild on‑the‑nose moralizing. Still, the reveal reweights prior material and invites reflection on negotiated order versus ritual combat. Subtext operates in gestures—the deflection instead of strike, the listening over speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of making beauty from anarchy and words as bricks/welding are embodied in objects and action. The Neruda/Mateo backstory enriches the manifesto without devolving into sermonizing, though “Beauty from anarchy...” edges toward on-the-nose. The final image reweights prior motifs into communal hope with cost. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Art as agency against fate threads the piece: a pianist uses sound to reweight time and static, with love reframed as intervention rather than escape. Recurring objects (clock, reel, compasses) accrue meaning and reprice the premise in the final tick. Resonance is earned through enacted choices, not moralizing; the ambiguity around the coalescing figure deepens rather than blurs the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—truth as a measured/magical braid and the stewardship of cultural memory—emerges from events, not lecture. Recurring images (seed, song, ridge) reweight by the end as memory becomes communal chorus. The final acceptance of “luminous doubt” resists tidy closure and feels earned. Slight directness in the last lines nudges toward statement, but subtext still carries.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of patience, craft, and accountability emerge organically via bonsai practice and the lace-as-map. Recurring images (cerulean, roots/branches, tide) accrue meaning and shift at the end toward hope without sentimentality. One line—the color “was the act of seeking itself”—edges toward explicit statement but is supported by concrete action immediately after. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic development is the story's greatest strength. It masterfully contrasts spectacle with process, exploring this theme through the parallel scales of a butterfly wing, a greenhouse, and a neutron star. The final realization, "The drama was a human imposition," feels like a hard-won truth, not a delivered moral. The closing image of the dust vial as a "compass pointing toward patience" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict that lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story successfully dramatizes its theme of finding meaning in meticulous observation, culminating in a resonant final image. However, a significant flaw is the direct statement of the theme ("to discover purpose in the pauses"), an instance of thematic echo that tells the reader what the story is about rather than trusting the events to show it. This explicit signposting prevents the theme from feeling fully emergent and pulls the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges with power and grace from the story’s particulars—resilience, the transformation of grief, and the redefinition of communication. The final image of auras blending into a silent symphony is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held just shy of the 9-band because the final paragraphs contain several lines that verge on stating the theme directly ("The silence wasn’t empty; it was a canvas..."), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the story’s core images. The central concept of revitalizing a broken object by repurposing its flaw into a strength provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of unresolved sorrow. The piece avoids any hint of moralizing, allowing the final image of the steady, transformed light to carry the full weight of its meaning about memory, duty, and finding peace in imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, emerging organically from the narrative particulars. The story explores continuity, hope, and unseen connections without a single didactic misstep. The final image of the "living tapestry" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question of how to endure. The bell's chime is a perfect thematic culmination—a sound that doesn't break the quiet but gives it meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme is developed with subtlety and power, culminating in a resonant conceptual repricing. The initial premise—finding a reservoir of unused love—is brilliantly re-framed by the climax: love isn't stored, it's "released *through* connection." This earned insight emerges directly from the story's events and images, avoiding any didactic moralizing and leaving a lingering, complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of time, memory, and grief is woven organically through the story's high-concept premise. The final image of the blank photograph is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final line, "The texture of time was grief," skirts the edge of being too declarative, but is saved by being an earned, internal character realization rather than authorial summary. It's a powerful and complex thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of resilience is powerfully embodied through action, culminating in the final sacrifice. However, the final paragraph shifts from resonant image to explicit thematic summary. Lines like "Staggering grace lived in the act of planting when all seemed lost" state the moral directly, a thematic echo that weakens the earned power of the preceding scene and incurs a penalty for telling the reader the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring the physical residue of emotional trauma without a single line of overt moralizing. The central concept of a "resonant void" is made tangible through the plot itself. The final image of the dimming aurora and dying embers provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful feeling of melancholic truth.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reinterpreting grief into a map for self-discovery is powerfully developed through the central motifs of light and floral codes. The final image provides a resonant answer to the story's core question. However, the theme is slightly undermined by moments of direct statement, particularly the line, "They were instructions for finding herself," which articulates the story’s thesis too explicitly and lessens the impact of the earned, imagistic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of renewal is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of melting ice and the craft of glassblowing. The final image of the glass orbs is resonant. However, the story occasionally resorts to thematic echo, stating its concepts too directly. Lines like "the core concept of renewal humming in his veins" and "The thawing heart wasn't just his—it was the earth's, the people's" feel like authorial explanation rather than earned, emergent understanding, slightly diminishing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of vulnerability as power is central, but its execution lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly states its theme directly, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary ("Vulnerability wasn’t a cage; it was the key..."). This thematic over-articulation, especially at the end, replaces earned resonance with explicit explanation, undercutting the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of finding structure within absence emerges organically from the story's core conceit and is beautifully paid off in the final image. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of the dark. A minor deduction is made for a few lines that verge on stating the theme directly, such as "Her obsession wasn’t madness, but necessity," slightly thinning the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of consciousness emerging from experience is thoughtfully explored and integrated. The final image of the violin refreezing is a potent, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements in the final third, such as "thoughts arose from the accumulation and integration of repeated experiences," which reads like an authorial summary rather than an earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transparency dissolving mistrust is central and well-developed through image and action, particularly the gesture with the cello case and Elara’s offering of the lens. However, the story occasionally slips into thematic summary, stating its points directly. Lines like "freed by honesty" and "Motivated to thaw mistrust with transparency" are too explicit, slightly undermining the subtext and earning a deduction for thematic echo that borders on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of resilience and the value of unmeasured care emerges organically from the central symbol of the polished, cracked marbles. The story avoids any didactic moralizing, instead allowing the theme to unfold through Elara's actions and the garden's response. The final image of the single white rose offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, a testament to a currency the Quantifiers cannot see. The concept of the "mended deception" provides a complex thematic core that lingers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of a quiet, "subdued awakening" is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the plot rather than being stated. The climax is a powerful demonstration of this idea—a universe-altering discovery that occurs not with a bang, but a "deep thrum." The final image of the lone, vindicated scientist against the backdrop of the sleeping giants offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about truth and recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conceit that revelation can be found in ruin. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to resonate through images and actions. The final line's distinction between a "requiem" and a "resolution" provides a sophisticated and non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is masterfully handled, emerging organically from the fusion of character and concept. The idea of fault tolerance is brilliantly transposed from a technical protocol to a model for processing grief. The story's final image—the smudged illustration accepted and put away—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, reweighting the meaning of error from failure to data. There is no moralizing, only a complex and earned thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of buried guilt and confession given physical form is potent and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements. Madame Zara’s line explaining the foreman’s remorse and Leo’s realization that "The truth wasn't in the weight of metal... but in the hush after confession" verge on thematic summary, slightly reducing the resonance of an otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of transformation versus preservation is expertly woven into every element, from the crumbling setting to the final, resonant image. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex and poignant answer to its central question through the climax. The final realization, "The knowledge wasn’t lost; it was changing form," is slightly explicit but saved by the powerful imagery of the glowing fungi, providing a non-literal reweighting of the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" emerges organically from the central action, with the curl serving as a powerful, non-literal anchor for the concept of connection. The story's strength is in showing this theme through the scene work. However, the score is capped by multiple instances of thematic echoing, where the narration explicitly states the theme ("ordinary magic of connection taking root," "The world needed this softly adaptive magic"), slightly reducing the resonance that was already earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of memory and its various forms of record—textual, artistic, geological—is woven together with subtlety and intelligence. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of synthesis as its answer to the central question of what endures. The line "perhaps all stories were warnings" provides a lingering, complex thematic echo that elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "open secrets" is cleverly woven into the plot mechanics. However, the story undermines its own subtlety by repeatedly stating the theme aloud, especially in the final paragraph. The line "the most profound secrets were always hiding in the open" acts as a moral summary, replacing earned resonance with explanation. This thematic telling significantly reduces the story's literary power at its most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme—that faith is an active, participatory force, not a static monument—emerges organically from the story’s central conflict without a single line of overt moralizing. The concept of belief as a structural component of reality is dramatized through specific, resonant actions. The final image of the indigo smear serves as a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lingering sense of earned, fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding profound meaning in personal history emerges organically from the story's central mechanic. The contrast between hollow fortune cookie wisdom and the authentic "music of stone and starlight" is potent. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's yearning without ever stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story builds a potent theme of self-acceptance through its central metaphor and resonant imagery. Unfortunately, the climax suffers from a major thematic echo. The dialogue—"The labyrinth isn't out there... It's the path you walk now"—replaces earned resonance with a direct, summarizing statement of the story's thesis. This over-explanation significantly weakens the otherwise powerful final images.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in brokenness emerges organically from the central action, which is a great strength. However, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's point ("proving that the most profound music often lives in the spaces we cannot hear"). This 'Thematic Echo' flaw undermines the powerful, resonant image of the shared connection, reducing an earned discovery to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of integrity shifting from isolation to intervention is powerfully integrated into the plot. However, the story's primary weakness lies in its final paragraphs, which explicitly state the theme ("Integrity, she realized, thrived not in isolation..."). This thematic echo replaces the resonance of the final image with a less impactful moral summary, a significant flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory's sensory nature emerges organically from the story's core conceit. The climax provides a powerful, non-literal answer through the revealed molecular tapestry. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "Thematic Echo," explicitly stating the theme ("memories weren’t stored in the nose, but in the heart...") which slightly undermines the resonance of the preceding image by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from the central conflict and the protagonist's actions. The story's final question, "What texture does freedom wear...," serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the core dilemma, beautifully reweighting all prior material without a hint of moralizing. It’s a sophisticated and memorable thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding wholeness in fracture emerges organically from the story’s particulars. The grandfather's wisdom about "the space between the notes" provides a perfect anchor without being didactic. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped slightly below 9.0 because a few lines, like "The unfinished became whole in its incompleteness," veer close to summarizing the theme directly rather than letting the image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of authentic versus manufactured emotion is explored with nuance and depth. The concept of the "half-truth" provides a sophisticated framework, and the story avoids easy moralizing. The final image and Lena's subsequent decision provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, landing on the idea that true empathy requires honoring the "unspoken wound" rather than attempting to perfectly replicate feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of honoring unseen work is powerfully embodied in Mateo's story and Aris's subsequent project. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary with "Compassion, he realized, wasn’t a gesture but a cycle..." This direct statement slightly undermines the "show, don't tell" principle by articulating the moral that the preceding actions had already effectively dramatized, warranting a specific deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme—that kinship is actively built, not passively found—emerges organically from the plot. The "Weaver" metaphor is effective, and the final image of the web provides a resonant answer to the central problem of isolation. The piece avoids a simplistic moral, but occasionally leans on direct thematic statements ("The webs of kinship were not pre-existing; they were built") which slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme emerges organically from the plot, linking creativity, courage, and the nature of time. The final image of her sketchbook containing the "living pulse of time" is a powerful thematic conclusion. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the line, "echoes weren’t born from silence, but from the courage to break a rhythm and reshape time’s flow." This direct thematic statement in the final section borders on moralizing, a "Thematic Echo" flaw that slightly lessens the resonance of the otherwise earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic integration is superb, with the central idea—that meaning can be found in brokenness—emerging organically from the plot mechanics. The "chipped patterns" on the stone are not just a symbol but the literal algorithm for the solution. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of seeing the unseen and the resonance of memory is beautifully integrated and culminates in a powerful final image. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex, emotional truth. However, the score is slightly capped because the theme is explicitly stated in the narration ("to prove the unseen custodian mattered," "To become visible... meant ensuring *others* were seen"). This brief moment of telling slightly lessens the impact of what is otherwise expertly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of surrender versus control emerges organically from the conflict and imagery. The story largely trusts the reader, culminating in a powerful, non-literal answer to its central question. However, the final line, "surrender wasn’t defeat, but the deepest form of study," functions as a thematic echo, slightly over-stating a truth the preceding action had already beautifully dramatized, which holds it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of convergence—of hope and loss, enemy and victim, past and future—emerges organically from the story's central object and climactic revelation. The story powerfully resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex emotional truth in the final feeling of "haggard awe." The final image of sketching the map provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial struggle, moving from documenting ruin to blueprinting recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of grand prophecy versus everyday wonder emerges organically from Elara's conflict. The pilgrim's dialogue veers close to stating the theme directly, but the story is saved by the powerful climax, which has Elara *experience* the theme rather than just hear it. The final image of the understood song provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, particularly the transformation of the trumpet from a symbol of trauma to one of defiant hope. The story culminates in a resonant final image that answers its central question without resorting to moralizing. The final sentence, while eloquent, verges on stating the theme too explicitly, a minor flaw that slightly lessens the impact of what was already perfectly demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of observation versus participation, and the necessity of confronting personal truth, emerges organically from the plot. The central metaphor of the mapmaker who has failed to map his own grief is potent. The final image of his confession joining the others is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the final sentences ("the unspoken weight lifted, the fortress now part of him"), which lean towards summarizing the thematic resolution rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of interconnectedness—between species, time, and the cosmos—is woven skillfully through the core concept of "entangled memories." The final image of Elara as a "witness" and the re-framing of her purpose to "repair" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial skepticism. The story avoids a simple moral, though a few phrases like "a harmony of courage and connection" verge on stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of what lies beyond finality emerges organically from the character's struggle, not from authorial statement. The final realization that "goodbye wasn’t a wall; it was a membrane" is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. This concluding image powerfully recontextualizes Aeon's entire journey without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of finding equilibrium and a "fair trade" in a morally compromised world is developed with nuance and precision. The story avoids a simplistic moral by having the "honest" solution involve leveraging criminal knowledge, embracing complexity over purity. The ink pot, initially a symbol of inheritance, is reweighted as a tool of mental alchemy, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about value and justice. The final image powerfully synthesizes the plot's resolution with its thematic inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding connection and meaning amidst loss is handled with subtlety and power. The concept of "invented histories" as "resonant truths pulled from time's discarded fragments" is a sophisticated premise explored through concrete action. The final image of Elara preparing to chart the next resonance provides a powerful, non-didactic answer to the story's central problem, resonating long after the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of erased histories versus reclaimed truths is flawlessly integrated, creating a powerful parallel between the protagonist's bureaucratic non-existence and the port's buried secrets. The story resists simple morals, instead using the final image—the label pressed into the mud—as a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what constitutes a life. Subtext operates powerfully through the recurring motif of "layers" and "texture."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence and mystery, rather than in provable facts, emerges organically from character and action without a single didactic misstep. The story’s final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central riddle, beautifully resolving the tension between science and wonder. Subtext is handled with sophistication, particularly in the symbolism of the unfinished cello.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of community resilience emerges organically from the plot without a single line of moralizing. The story masterfully uses its central symbols—the broken key, the stone chip, the woven net—to explore the conflict between ownership and spirit. The final image of the new graffiti offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, leaving the reader with a feeling of "fragile but fierce" hope that is deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of memory versus progress is beautifully integrated, emerging from resonant images like the single sand grain and the photograph as a "message in a bottle." The piece avoids moralizing, allowing the "dawnlit melancholy" to convey its complex emotional truth. The line "a testament to what was lost" verges on being too explicit, a minor thematic statement that slightly reduces the subtext's power in an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding profound capability within a perceived limitation emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph includes an explicit thematic statement ("her blindness a lens focusing pure direction...") that tells the reader the story's meaning directly. This thematic echo significantly lessens the resonance of the final image, stating what the preceding action had already so powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding profound knowledge in mundane patterns ("revelation in the mundane chill") emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the melting ice is resonant. However, the final paragraph drifts towards thematic summary with phrases like "the quiet science of condensation and convergence," slightly over-explaining a truth the preceding scene had already powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story achieves a rare and perfect fusion of concept and theme. The central idea of restoring communal rhythm to combat the entropy of greed and haste emerges organically from every narrative element, without a single line of explicit moralizing. The final image of the tuning fork's note blending with the footsteps offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem, embodying hope and ongoing effort in a single, powerful chord.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding power in stillness and salvation through surrender emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Aris carrying the silence within him provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final third with several lines that read like direct thematic statements, such as "He’d unsnarled death’s knot by surrendering to stillness." This repetition of the thesis ("thematic echo") slightly dulls the otherwise strong, emergent resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic handling is the story's greatest strength. The central theme—of escaping an inherited legacy of lies to find a personal truth in silence—is woven through every element with subtlety and power. The final image of the boy vanishing into the sea to "chase the hush" provides a perfect, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire narrative without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of paradoxical balance—healing through harm, life from death—is woven into every element rather than stated. The central concept of "lovingly venomous" grace finds its perfect expression in the image of the reviving vine with crumbling thorns. The final image of Silas holding the inert bead in the thriving orchard offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about debt and sacrifice, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of mending memory and weaving hope from ruin is beautifully integrated. The final image of the children and the new orchid shoots offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of loss. The story mostly avoids overt moralizing, but the line "ruin was not the end, but the loom upon which reverence could be rewoven" comes dangerously close to a thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is flawlessly integrated through the central metaphor of the sundial, representing broken time, faith, and lineage. The resolution avoids any heavy-handed moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the shadow marking time as a "continuation." This provides a non-literal, emotionally complex answer to the story's central question about mending what was broken.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of finding human meaning in obsolete, analog forms is expertly woven through the story’s particulars, from the surface mail to the sidewalk chalk. It emerges organically from the conflict and imagery without resorting to overt moralizing. The final image of the letter as a "fragile, human pulse" provides a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question, achieving a complex emotional aftereffect that lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding truth in absences ("read the silences between the stars") is masterfully woven through the narrative, culminating in a powerful final image. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central questions about resistance and hope. The recurring motifs of light, shadow, and hidden patterns are integrated with a subtlety that is rare and impressive.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of healing through understanding rather than recrimination emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final image of the healing wound is a superb, non-literal resolution. However, the story falters slightly with the line "...but the lesson remained: some apologies live not in words spoken..." which is an explicit thematic summary that momentarily replaces resonance with direct statement, a minor but distinct flaw at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, particularly the central metaphor of translating pain into understanding. The story earns its final resonance by demonstrating this transformation, rather than simply stating it. The final image of the re-shaped symbol offers a non-literal, poignant answer to the story's core question. A minor deduction is for the final clause, "even broken things could be read, and remade," which verges on a thematic summary, slightly telling what the rest of the story showed so beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in ruin and revelation in damage is expertly woven through the story's core mechanics (the fragment, the exposed film). The final image of the thinning fog offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final sentence on joy is slightly explicit but feels earned after the powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of curiosity's value emerges organically from the plot, but the story falters by stating its thesis explicitly. The final lines, "I chose curiosity over certainty," and "Curiosity...is the most vital restoration of all," function as a thematic summary. This moralizing in the final third replaces the resonance of the closing image with a neat, declarative statement, which significantly lessens its power.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of resistance through quiet, creative subversion is brilliantly embodied in the central metaphor of dissent cultivated in soil. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—unbidden anger, a free laugh—as a non-literal answer to the question of what it means to resist. The line "we *make* the garden the message" crystallizes the theme with powerful elegance, emerging directly from the plot's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of art's power to transmute suffering is explored with exceptional depth and specificity. The central conceit of "photosynthesizing pain" is carried through with startlingly original imagery, avoiding cliché or moralizing. The final image of the poet sleeping as the sea "sang back in off-key harmonies" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, achieving a profound emotional aftereffect without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of finding strength and purpose in brokenness is developed with profound subtlety. The central idea, "Broken vessels still hold songs," is dramatized rather than stated, culminating in the final image where the cracked bamboo tube is recognized as a superior channel for the echo. This resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question is a mark of exceptional thematic craft.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of "symphonies of truth" is brilliantly integrated, serving not just as a concept but as the literal mechanic of the plot. The story demonstrates its theme through action rather than stating it, culminating in a resonant final image of "a shared melody." Master Thorne's remembered words introduce the theme organically, framing it as a guiding principle that Elara must learn to embody.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of harmonizing pragmatism and preservation is powerfully embodied in the central conflict and Elara's secret design. The concept of "encrypted compassion" is a resonant and elegant core. The story's main thematic flaw is the final sentence, which veers into overt summary ("engineering not just water flow, but a fragile, necessary peace"), a thematic echo that slightly lessens the impact by stating what the preceding action had already beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, emerging organically from the central conflict. The story explores trust, preservation, and atonement without a single line of moralizing. The final image of the pigeon disappearing provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, re-contextualizing her past actions against her present choice and leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of "necessary distances" emerges with grace and power from the story's particulars, avoiding didacticism. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, a moment of profound earned wisdom. A minor deduction is made for the direct quotation of her father's lesson ("Thresholds feel sacred because they guard necessary distances"), which borders on a thematic statement, slightly reducing subtextual depth in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of belonging forged through destruction and rebirth is beautifully integrated through the central feather motif. However, the final paragraph verges on over-articulating its own meaning. Lines like "Elara finally understood the rhythm wasn't out there..." function as a thematic summary, slightly undermining the power of the preceding image of the shared breath. This explicit moralizing prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of memory, loss, and cyclical restoration is coherent and emerges organically from the plot. The story's primary weakness in this category is the ending, which resorts to thematic summary. Lines like "...proving that even in loss, there was continuity" and "...every disappearance held a seed of return" function as explicit morals, undercutting the resonance of the final image by explaining it to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of creativity flourishing within curated chaos is powerful and emergent from the story's events. However, the piece slightly undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as, "This was her gift: proving creativity thrived not in defiance of chaos but within its curated edges." This "thematic echo" articulates the story's thesis directly, reducing the resonance that the final images could have achieved on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story develops its themes of memory, art, and exile with subtlety for most of its length, culminating in the resonant image of the body as a map. However, the final two sentences veer into direct thematic summary ("She had fled to remember, and in remembering... a promise that exile could be the deepest kind of homecoming"). This "Thematic Echo" slightly undermines the power of the preceding imagery by over-explaining its meaning, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of interconnectedness and the beauty within repair emerges organically from the central metaphor of the ripples. The insight is powerful and resists simple moralizing. The final line, "The value was always there, waiting to be illuminated," while resonant, verges on a thematic statement that slightly undermines the perfect subtlety achieved moments before, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme is potent, its delivery is marred by overt thematic statements that undermine subtext. Phrases like "to forge warning from sorrow, to make the fire’s story a beacon, not just a tombstone" function as a "Thematic Echo," where the character explicitly articulates the story's moral. This removes ambiguity and reduces the resonance of an otherwise powerful emotional journey, feeling more like a summary than an earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of hope shifting from a solitary to a collective virtue is powerfully developed through the central balloon metaphor. However, the final paragraph succumbs to overt thematic statement, explicitly summarizing the story's meaning. The final equation, "hope = (courage × connection) ÷ isolation²," functions as a thesis statement that replaces the resonance of the final image, constituting a significant "Thematic Echo" that undermines the preceding subtlety and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of legacy, memory, and redemption emerges organically from the story’s central images. However, the final paragraphs verge on thematic summary, with lines like "Legacy’s burden wasn’t meant to crush but to compel" stating the moral too explicitly. This slightly diminishes the resonance of the final image, which could have carried the meaning more powerfully on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of seeing possibilities is beautifully rendered through the story’s central images, particularly the two visions in the mirrors. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary (“This was her purpose: not to create escape, but to illuminate...”). This authorial explanation, while elegantly phrased, slightly undermines the power of the preceding images, stating what was already powerfully shown and preventing the theme from emerging with pure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme—that ideals require the practice of humility—emerges organically from the central conflict, culminating in Elara's costly admission. The story avoids moralizing; her key thematic statement ("Because the ideal of peace...") is not an authorial intrusion but a tactical justification delivered under pressure. The final image of the "flawed beauty" of the terrace becoming a foundation provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions about redemption and peace.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of manufactured scarcity, memory, and futile atonement is woven seamlessly into the story’s imagery and action without a single instance of moralizing. The theme emerges organically from the contrast between the iridescent egg and the desolate salt flat. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, re-weighting Thorne's gesture with profound ambiguity and emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of artistic rebellion against enforced conformity emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphors. The concept of weaponized grace and silence as defiance is powerful and lands with force. The final image of the waking city provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any overt moralizing and leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story explores its central theme of ethical storytelling with nuance and complexity. However, the final insight is stated too directly, functioning as a thematic summary that slightly undermines the power of the final image. This moment of explicit articulation ("...revealing the strings...making the audience complicit") verges on moralizing, diluting the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of remembrance, transience, and witness is woven deeply into the story's fabric. The final image of the joined wings offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor the ephemeral. However, the score is slightly capped by moments of thematic over-articulation in the final paragraph, such as "finally understanding that remembrance...was a sanctuary built moment by moment," which verges on stating the moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of preservation through sacrifice is beautifully integrated with the lost wax casting metaphor, the story suffers from overt thematic statements. Lines like "Preserving them wasn’t nostalgia; it was resistance against oblivion" and "She had not just preserved the forgotten; she had forgiven the silence" function as authorial explanations. This "thematic echo" anti-pattern undercuts the powerful subtext of the final image, telling the reader the story's meaning rather than allowing it to resonate organically.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of sentience arising from memory and decay is beautifully woven through the narrative, emerging organically from the plot. The final image of the arch glowing and the lightning diverting is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. However, the final sentence ("She would rebuild the directive not as law, but as a lullaby...") is a textbook Thematic Echo, a direct authorial statement that slightly undermines the resonant ambiguity of the preceding scene and incurs a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of humility and quiet observation yielding profound truth is powerfully woven through the narrative. The contrast between Kael's frugality and the stripped-bare grandeur of the palace is excellent. However, the final paragraph becomes slightly too explicit, stating the theme directly ("his poverty had made him rich in understanding"), which slightly diminishes the resonance of what was already shown through powerful imagery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of nonviolent healing and the persistence of peace is coherent and well-conceived. However, its delivery lacks subtlety, frequently resorting to overt thematic statements that function as a moral. Lines like “Resentment chains you to the past” and the summarizing final sentence explicitly state the story’s thesis, replacing the resonance of the final image with a neat, unchallenging explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of connection overcoming the limits of empirical science is beautifully integrated and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext by over-explaining the epiphany in the final paragraph. Lines like "she had recreated its purpose through the act of connection" state the theme directly, diluting the poetic power of the luminous web image that had already conveyed the meaning perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of tradition versus evolution is explored with nuance and powerful imagery, avoiding easy answers. The central metaphor of "deciduous vows" is brilliant, and the story earns its central epiphany. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A minor deduction is for the slight over-articulation in the final paragraphs ("No legal document could carry such layered meaning," followed shortly by "No contract could contain this wisdom"), which risks stating the theme too directly where the images have already done the work flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, particularly with the central motif of the blank cameo becoming engraved. The story explores the nature of time and destiny without resorting to exposition, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question. The only slight weakness is the directness of the epiphany ("Non-linear inheritance isn’t about..."), which comes very close to stating the theme outright, but it remains grounded enough within the character's POV to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is clear but its delivery lacks subtlety at the climax. The line "The cost of knowledge is humility; some truths are not for keeping" functions as a direct thematic statement, an on-the-nose moral that replaces earned resonance. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern significantly undermines the story's otherwise strong construction by summarizing its core idea instead of letting the action embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme is powerfully woven through the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simple moral. The concepts of memory, identity, and solace are explored with depth. The score is slightly tempered by moments of thematic over-statement, where concepts like "unkindled solace" are explicitly defined for the reader, which modestly reduces the power of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of reinterpreting historical absence is coherent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "Fables of absence weren't about emptiness...they were about what the void demanded" and the final clause transforming the event "from a wound into a lesson in trust" function as authorial summary, stating the moral rather than allowing it to resonate solely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of restoring balance by understanding and inverting chaos, rather than destroying it, emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids any moralizing, culminating in the powerful image of the dissonance being "folded into the deep, resonant calm." This final image provides a complex and resonant answer to the central problem, lingering long after the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic exploration of finding pattern in chaos is beautifully woven through the recurring motifs of the lark, stars, and thistles. Unfortunately, the story repeatedly undermines its own subtext by stating the theme directly. The final paragraph's summary of its own meaning is a critical flaw that prevents the theme from emerging with the resonant power it otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of sculpting identity from shared experience emerges organically from the story's core conceit and Elara's actions. The final image of her continuing her work, holding both peace and pain, provides a nuanced, resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is slightly compromised by the on-the-nose statement, "She realized her own purpose mirrored this process," which explicitly articulates the central thesis rather than allowing it to remain fully submerged in subtext, capping the score just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is woven into the story’s fabric with subtlety and power. The piece explores hope, guilt, and the nature of creation by contrasting grand, public art with a small, private act of resilience. The final image of the single flame reflected in the shattered mosaic provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara’s despair, beautifully embodying the idea that hope is not the absence of brokenness, but something made from it. It avoids all moralizing for a purely earned, imagistic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the synthesis of character, setting, and object. The exploration of time's "texture" versus its measurement is handled with nuance and poetic precision. The final image of the tide returning serves as a masterful, non-literal resolution to the central thematic question, reweighting the entire narrative without a single word of explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of silence as a living entity to be nurtured rather than hoarded emerges beautifully from the story's core conflict and imagery. However, its power is diminished by a direct thematic statement near the end ("silence wasn’t emptiness but a living thing..."). This moment of telling what was already powerfully shown is the story's most significant flaw, preventing an otherwise exceptional thematic execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming trauma into comfort is beautifully dramatized through the story’s central action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated in the narration, as with the line about turning "trauma's echo into something tender," which borders on stating its own thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of balancing past and future to achieve true stewardship is powerfully realized in the story's climax, which subverts the "claim the throne" trope beautifully. However, the theme's elegance is undermined by an on-the-nose summary in Elara's thoughts just before the ending ("Her people had forgotten that balance..."). This moment of telling weakens an otherwise resonant conclusion that is earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story develops its themes of grief, connection, and release with impressive nuance, culminating in a resonant final image of the doorknocker. However, the final paragraph contains a sentence that explicitly summarizes the story's central action and theme ("She had taught suffocating to breathe..."). This moment of telling in an otherwise masterful work of showing is a significant flaw that slightly undermines the earned power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transforming exploitation's pressure into enduring value is brilliantly woven into the plot, culminating in a powerful central image. However, the final line—"pressure, met with courage, always yields diamonds"—is an unnecessary thematic echo. It explicitly states the moral that the preceding action and image had already perfectly dramatized, slightly undermining the story's otherwise masterful use of subtext and costing it a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic exploration of legacy, truth, and silence is potent and emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's driving question. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this subtlety with lines that summarize the thematic shift ("She was the dynasty ender, yes, but not the destroyer... She was the one who finally heard him"), bordering on a thematic echo that states what was already powerfully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of salvaging potential rather than restoring a single past is beautifully realized without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of "a thousand overlapping dawns" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of entropy. The story’s conceptual core is sophisticated and fully integrated into the plot mechanics and character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of kindness and love persisting is potent, but its delivery is far too explicit, violating the principle of emergence. The story repeatedly summarizes its own moral in the final third, culminating in the on-the-nose notation: "Proof that love persists through the smallest tokens." This thematic echo significantly weakens the piece, replacing earned resonance with a stated conclusion, a critical flaw for a literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of fighting indifference through quiet, persistent action emerges organically from the story’s particulars, avoiding any moralizing. The contrast between the Ministry's sterile, revised histories and Kael's reliance on forgotten, almost elemental knowledge (starlight on water, an old key) creates profound resonance. The final image of the key disappearing into the glowing lagoon provides a non-literal, haunting answer to the story's central question about what it takes for truth to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is expertly woven through action and imagery, particularly the core concept of achieving silence not through noise but through structured absence ("negative space"). The final image of the unbroken rainbows provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The final sentence verges on over-articulating the theme ("a peace as quietly vivid..."), a hairline slip that keeps it from perfection, but the overall execution is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme is the story's greatest strength, elegantly developing the idea of remembrance as a creative, world-healing force. The concept that the Great Burning was a "forgetting" is a powerful re-framing that elevates the entire narrative. The final image of green shoots piercing the ash is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, emerging organically from the climax without a word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding a new kind of order in uncertainty is skillfully woven through the story's imagery and action, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the final paragraph verges on over-articulating its theme with phrases like "trust that coincidence becoming pattern wasn’t chaos, but a map." While framed as character insight, this slightly diminishes the power of the symbolic action, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of accepting brokenness is powerfully and organically integrated through the central metaphor of kintsugi. The final image of the glowing, mended coin provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. A deduction is applied for the line "he had failed by treating her absence as a problem to solve, not a presence to carry," a thematic statement that summarizes the epiphany rather than letting the preceding action and image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of reframing trauma by integrating a perceived failing (the laughter) as a survival instinct is potent and emerges organically from the conflict. The subtext is handled well through the imagery of dissonance resolving into a single pure note. However, the final line, "...a testament to the fragile, luminous courage it took to turn despair into song," verges on summarizing the theme for the reader. This explicit statement slightly lessens the resonance of the preceding, powerful image of the spirit dissolving into light.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding agency within an inescapable system of suffering is developed with nuance and power. The story avoids platitudes, instead exploring its central question—the "mathematics of mercy"—through concrete action and sensory experience. The interrogator's cynical definition of mercy is powerfully recontextualized by Kael's discovery, creating a thematic resolution that is complex and resonant. The final image of "deliberate, aching grace" provides a non-literal, earned answer that lingers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of honoring overlooked histories is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement, especially in the final paragraph. The line "proving that honoring overlooked histories could make an instant eternal" functions as an explicit moral summary, which undermines the power of the preceding imagery and violates the principle of earned resonance, preventing the theme from reaching its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of releasing hidden sorrows is woven skillfully through the narrative, culminating in a powerful final image. While the "cracks in the façade" metaphor is slightly explicit, the closing beat—the ghost ascending "to see what ceilings truly hid"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It's a sophisticated thematic execution that avoids a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic exploration of perfection, stability, and negotiability is seamlessly woven into the story's imagery and events. The final image of the printed mirror—a preserved moment of eternity placed within a newly fluid reality—offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The theme emerges organically from the particulars, avoiding any didactic statements and achieving a lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of wisdom destroyed by zealotry is powerfully rendered through Elara's tragic arc. The final realization that the ancients used "science, not prayer" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about faith and knowledge. While the closing lines verge on being slightly too explicit, they function as Elara's pained epiphany, anchoring the theme in character rather than authorial statement, which narrowly avoids a heavier penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of truth versus falsehood is brilliantly integrated, moving beyond moral abstraction into a physical law of the world where dishonesty causes literal decay. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead offering a resonant answer to its central question through the final image: new lilies pushing through ash. This provides a powerful, non-literal resolution that lingers with the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from image and action. The initial concept of petrichor—a measurable chemical reaction—is masterfully repriced in the final moments as "memory of the world before explanations existed." This conceptual shift provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry without a single word of moralizing. The piece lingers with a powerful sense of awe.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thematic development is the story’s central focus, but it suffers from a lack of subtext. Key themes are repeatedly stated in declarative, abstract language ("timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity with simplicity," "through layered meanings"). This creates a "Thematic Echo" effect, particularly in the final third, which tells the reader the meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the images alone, significantly reducing its literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding truth in quiet, dark spaces is organically developed through the central metaphor of night-blooming flowers. However, the story falters by over-stating its conclusions. Leo's revealed notes ("Like grief") and the final sentence ("...some truths bloom only when we stop demanding answers and learn to listen in the quiet") are thematic summaries that dilute the resonance of the final image, coming perilously close to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of bearing witness to historical injustice and bridging time to find truth emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Elias holding the key is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final sentence ("...the weight of Maris Cove's silenced voices now a burden he could carry forward, clear-eyed and unbroken") functions as an overt thematic summary, a "Thematic Echo" that slightly weakens the preceding image by over-explaining its significance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of rejecting false comfort for earned reality is woven masterfully through character, action, and image. The bottle and lanterns serve as potent symbols whose meanings evolve, culminating in a resonant final image that answers the story’s central question without resorting to a simple moral. A few lines verge on stating the theme directly, which is the only minor restraint on an otherwise exceptional execution.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of memory, preservation, and finality is profound and seamlessly integrated. The story powerfully re-frames its central concept from preservation as sanctuary to archiving as a "death rattle." The final image of the glass apples offers a haunting, non-literal answer to the story's core questions, achieving a resonance that lingers long after the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging from action and image rather than statement. The story's central questions about time, memory, and order versus entropy are answered not with a moral, but with the profound sensory experience of the climax. The final image of the meltwater drop provides a perfect, non-literal resonance that reweights the entire narrative of frozen stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of intuitive wisdom versus mechanical protocol emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of the single bell note provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core question without any moralizing. A slight deduction is for the minor redundancy in articulating the core motivation (e.g., "favor listening over noise"), which comes close to stating the theme directly in a couple of places.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme is potent and beautifully woven through the story's central imagery—the yielding star, the filtering glass, the ash of dead stars. The final insight feels earned by the preceding events. The score is held back by the explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph: "To find strength in vulnerability was to understand: even broken things channel light." This sentence is a Thematic Echo that over-articulates the story's core idea, slightly diminishing the power of the otherwise resonant final images.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory, silence, and preservation is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from the story's central images—the box, the ghosts, the scorched land. The final image of Silas listening offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments of over-articulation, such as when the narrator explains that the ghosts are "messengers" and their forms a "gift," which comes close to stating the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of time having a physical, emotional "texture" is woven effectively through the story's core conceit. However, the execution is marred by thematic overstatement, particularly in the final paragraph. The line "The texture of time was patience, and she was learning to feel it deeply" functions as a direct moral summary, weakening the resonance that the preceding images had already powerfully established.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges organically from the plot and the central imagery of the feather and broken kite. However, the story undermines its own subtlety in the final third by explicitly stating its conclusions. Lines like "completion was a myth, but connection was real" and "tenderness meant holding space for what was broken" function as thematic summaries, applying the "Thematic Echo" penalty and reducing the resonance that was otherwise skillfully built.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The themes of interspecies respect, gentle intervention, and finding meaning in impermanence emerge organically from Aris's actions. The final image of the sparrow on the wire is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The score is slightly tempered by a few lines that feel overly declarative, such as "architecture as diplomacy," which state the theme a bit too explicitly rather than letting it remain entirely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—contrasting scientific proof with spiritual seeking—is explored with remarkable nuance, culminating in a synthesis rather than a simple binary victory. The story’s final line, "home was never a destination, but a reaction," is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question that is earned by on-page events. It reweights the entire story without a trace of didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    The themes of healing, memory, and ecological reconciliation are woven deeply into the story’s unique premise. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A fractional deduction is applied for the line "This was how the land would remember," a thematic statement that verges on being too explicit, slightly undermining the subtextual power of the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of memory and communication is developed with nuance and power, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant answer without resorting to a stated moral. The central metaphor of a message that must be *read* rather than heard is potent. The score is held just below the 9-band by the slightly too-explicit statement of motivation early on ("to translate the crushing distance...").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding a fixed point in chaos is beautifully integrated and resolved through the central image of Polaris. The final realization resists a simple moral, landing on a complex sense of purpose. The story avoids sentimentality, but the grandmother's remembered wisdom, "True north isn’t just a direction... it’s the pulse beneath the noise," borders on a thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power that the final image otherwise achieves on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of active wonder and reverent intervention is compelling, its delivery is overly didactic. The story repeatedly states its philosophy through remembered lessons, culminating in a thematic summary in the final paragraph ("He hadn’t just fixed the sky; he’d amended his own fear..."). This heavy-handedness undermines the potential for resonant subtext, turning an emergent idea into an explicit moral. The small, potent gesture of leaving an acorn is a highlight of showing, but it's an exception.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic exploration of memory, truth, and the significance of small histories versus grand narratives is handled with depth and nuance. The central theme emerges organically from Elara's actions and the story's core images—the empty chessboard, the spelling in dust, the single pawn. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. A slight deduction is warranted for moments that verge on thematic summary, such as "truth demanded this unflinching archive," which momentarily states what the rest of the story shows so well.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory, grief, and the nature of belonging is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the story’s central images. The final realization that home is a "constellation of textures" is a potent, resonant answer to the central question. However, the final paragraph slightly over-articulates this theme with phrases like "a balm revealing home was never lost," which dilutes the power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of self-forgiveness and re-framing the past emerges organically from the central symbols. However, the story explicitly states its central thesis in the climax: "Forgiveness, she understood, wasn’t about erasing the past but integrating its lessons." This thematic echo replaces the power of a resonant image with a less impactful intellectual summary, significantly weakening the subtext at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of multifaceted truth versus rigid dogma is powerfully integrated into the central metaphor of refraction. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final paragraph dips into summary ("Forgiveness wasn’t surrender; it was the shared burden..."), which slightly over-explains the otherwise potent thematic resolution, preventing a higher score. The subtext is strong but is occasionally undermined by dialogue that states the theme too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of kintsugi is central and potent, but its delivery is marred by overt thematic statements. The statue’s line "...strength lies not in perfection, but in the golden seams" and Elara’s final realization, "Meaning wasn't salvation... it was the act of mending itself," function as authorial morals. This "thematic echo" in the climax undermines subtext, replacing earned resonance with direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of memory versus presence is explored with nuance and emotional honesty, culminating in a resonant final image of the harbor as a "threshold." The story largely avoids moralizing. However, the explicit naming of the "core concept" as "a temporary eternity" feels like a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext. Similarly, the line "a letting go that felt like coming home" verges on summarizing the story's emotional thesis in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of quiet power versus brute force is elegantly woven into the plot through the central metaphor of whispers and shouts. However, the final paragraphs slightly undermine this subtlety with statements like "love travels farthest when it doesn’t demand to be heard." This thematic summary, while resonant, verges on telling the reader the moral, which prevents the theme from emerging purely through the story's powerful imagery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of navigating grief by building a new purpose from its remnants is beautifully integrated. The central metaphor of the "geography of loss" is introduced early and reconfigured powerfully at the end. However, the final paragraph veers into thematic summary ("Grief hadn’t vanished... they’d forged a map from loss itself... its lesson held..."), which slightly undermines the power of the closing image by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of truth versus comfort is explored with nuance, culminating in a resonant final image of "fractured grace." However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the direct statement, "Psychological safety wasn’t silence; it was the space where truth...could finally be borne." This line functions as a thematic summary, a minor but distinct flaw that states the conclusion rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, primarily the juxtaposition of the alpine flower and the sea. The story explores connection, memory, and the nature of home with profound subtlety, resisting any simple moral. The final image of Silas pressing the Edelweiss into his logbook is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of isolation, transforming a solitary duty into a shared vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of understanding one's own choices rather than seeking escape emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the internal map is resonant. However, the sentence "The lingering promise wasn’t about escaping loneliness, but understanding..." verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power of an otherwise strong and earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of leadership as a burden transformed by love is woven seamlessly through the narrative. The story contrasts the symbolic weight of the crown ("felt like lead") with the tangible memory of a child's hand, ultimately reconciling them in the final act of will. The final image of Elara "carrying the sky's fragile peace" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial disenchantment without any overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of presence versus preservation is explored with remarkable depth and subtlety. It evolves from an intellectual concept ("scientifically romantic") into a profound emotional truth without ever resorting to moralizing. The final image—the shell holding not captured light but a "memory of resonance"—serves as a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful and lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic exploration of mortality, memory, and narrative as a survival tool is handled with masterful subtlety. The story avoids any stated moral, instead offering a complex, resonant answer in the final image of "chaos distilled, not conquered, but made bearable." The concept of jealousy toward a past self provides a uniquely powerful and specific lens on these themes, achieving a profound emotional aftereffect that lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges with profound subtlety from the story’s particulars, exploring shared grief and non-verbal connection. The final image of the bowl beside the screw is a masterclass in subtext. The score is held just below the 9-band because the final two paragraphs verge on over-articulating the epiphany ("The scentless world wasn’t empty... She finally understood..."), slightly reducing the resonance that the preceding action had already so powerfully established.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of transforming trauma into narrative strength emerges organically from the central conflict and is beautifully dramatized. The final image of the abandoned tea ceremony fulfilling its purpose is resonant and subtle. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext in the closing paragraphs by explicitly stating its themes ("weaving it into meaning," "scars could be ink"), which comes across as a "thematic echo" that lessens the impact of the final, quieter images.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of imperfect reconciliation is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the plot rather than being stated. The central concept of "imperfect miracles" governs the entire narrative, culminating in a powerful final image of the chainsaw's snarl underscored by an "unfinished melody." This offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about apology and loss, avoiding sentimentality for a more complex emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of illusion versus unified truth is explored with conceptual rigor. The central metaphors of the dictionary and spiral library work effectively to carry the thematic weight without excessive authorial intrusion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, although some of the dictionary definitions, while clever, come close to stating the theme directly rather than purely implying it.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of time, measurement, and mortality emerges organically from the story's central images and actions. The final resonant image of Aris's deliberate footsteps is powerful. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated in the final quarter, with a line like "...time's true measure was the courage to stand at the razor's edge" functioning as a thematic statement that verges on a tidy moral, slightly diminishing the earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of "letting go" is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of showing over telling. The story repeatedly states its central message through lines like "surrender, not force" and the final log entry, "Letting go revolutionizes all." This thematic moralizing, a form of "Thematic Echo," prevents the theme from emerging organically from the events and instead imposes it upon the reader, feeling more like a thesis statement than a resonant narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of logic versus hope is explored with nuance and intelligence through compelling imagery. However, the story falters by making its theme too explicit in the final act. The last few paragraphs contain lines like "probability described the world, but hope moved through it" and "'And sometimes, the fallacy is what saves us,'" which function as direct authorial statements, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at the moment of highest resonance and incurring a Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of endings becoming beginnings is powerfully integrated, culminating in the resonant final line about teaching "silence how to sing." However, the story occasionally slips into direct thematic statement, slightly weakening its subtext. The line "His motivation wasn't charity but a quiet mission: to teach endings how to begin" functions as a thematic echo that states what the subsequent scene could have shown on its own, a minor flaw in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory as an act of resistance emerges powerfully from the story's central imagery and the final, resonant action of passing the vellum sheet. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its themes directly. Phrases like "resistance through proximate causes" and "the regenerated covenant demanded this" feel like authorial labels rather than organic character thought, slightly flattening the otherwise profound subtext. The exquisite final image salvages the score.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic handling is exceptionally nuanced. The story explores the nature of connection, moving from a rigid, almost mathematical concept of "reciprocity" to an emergent, organic understanding of community. The moon rock's shifting meaning—from a relic of failure to a symbol of shared endeavor—is a perfect, non-didactic vehicle for this theme. The final line, "...turns out it's mostly just showing up," delivers a profound conclusion with beautiful understatement.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of grief and healing is explored with profound nuance, emerging organically from the story's unique mechanics. The final realization—"the stillpoint wasn’t found, but forged"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of a tidy moral. The brother's quoted wisdom lands just shy of being overly explicit, but is effectively re-contextualized by Elara's earned experience, preserving the theme's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    While the theme of finding meaning in process over outcome is potent and well-integrated into the plot, its delivery is undercut by overt thematic statements. The story repeatedly uses phrases like "thresh meaning" and culminates in a final paragraph that explicitly states its moral. This "thematic echo" ("meaning wasn’t in the harvest but in the threshing") preempts the reader's own discovery, substituting a powerful, resonant image with a less impactful summary.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's central conceit, exploring the nature of art, being seen, and communication with nuance and depth. The final image of Elara playing the flute offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. The concluding line, "The music didn’t fill the void; it revealed the profound, singing heart within it," is an exceptional piece of thematic crystallization that reweights the entire story without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of preservation through concealment is expertly woven into the narrative, creating a powerful parallel between Elara's past (the library fire) and the Aethelians' actions. The story resists easy moralizing, and the final image of her creating and then hiding a new mural provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme emerges organically from the plot and character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story masterfully explores themes of grief, memory, and rebellion against sterile systems without a single line of explicit moralizing. The theme emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of "auroral sorrow"—a beauty intertwined with profound loss—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful and lingering emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "whispers over shouts" is coherently demonstrated through action, but its power is diminished by being too explicitly stated. The protagonist’s motivation is articulated like a thesis statement, and the final line ("...proving that in the heart of the storm, quiet truths traveled farthest") functions as a concluding moral. This lack of subtext prevents the theme from emerging with the resonance of a truly top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of silent empathy and finding light within darkness is powerfully embodied in the central metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own "show, don't tell" ethos by explicitly stating its themes, such as in "some wounds couldn’t be named, only witnessed" and the guardian's stated motivation. These moments of thematic echo, while poetic, slightly blunt the resonance that the imagery so effectively creates on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of quiet rebellion and the reclamation of history through art is handled with subtlety and power. The central metaphor of "forests of second thoughts" is effectively seeded and then harvested in the final line. The closing image of the tree in the stone provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is slightly capped by moments of thematic over-articulation, such as the direct statement of Elara's motivation, which verges on telling the reader the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of embracing one's true nature emerges organically from the conflict and imagery. The final transformation provides a powerful, resonant answer to the central question of belonging. The story mostly avoids moralizing, but a few lines like "shedding a skin that no longer served her" and calling her transformation a "birthright" verge on thematic statements, slightly over-articulating what the narrative already shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's particulars, particularly the contrast between the dead flowers and the newly carved bird. The potato metaphor is a brilliant piece of subtextual dialogue that weaponizes the mundane. The story's final line—"grief breathed, light and unburdened"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The only minor friction is the slightly too-explicit whittling metaphor, but it's believably framed as part of Elara's performance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme is coherent, its delivery lacks subtlety. The story explicitly states its core ideas through Elara’s shadow-script ("Fear guards emptiness," "Light requires the dance"). This act of "paraphrasing" the glyphs becomes a vehicle for thematic echo, replacing subtext with direct assertion. The resonant final image is somewhat undercut by the overly didactic path taken to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is seamlessly integrated, emerging organically from character and action rather than statement. The story's central question about beauty and imperfection is answered by the final, resonant image of inner light animating the grey canvas. This moment masterfully reweights all prior material, providing a complex and emotionally honest conclusion without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of connection as a tangible presence emerges powerfully from the central metaphor of sonic fossils. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, a few moments of over-articulation, such as "...connection wasn’t about restoring the past but feeling its weight in the present," state the theme too directly, slightly undermining the otherwise potent subtext and earning a minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding resilient life within grief is developed with nuance and powerful imagery, particularly the contrast between encasing dead flowers and embedding dormant seeds. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the use of italics for key phrases like "to teach withering to bloom again" borders on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of mapping intangible social trauma is potent and emerges organically from the story's core concept. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic over-articulation, such as "The crash was the symptom. This... is the diagnosis," which come perilously close to stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory's power lying in its impermanence emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of the purified atoms offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. However, the final paragraph, while framed as Elara's realization, comes very close to stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the subtext that was so powerfully built. This moment of explicit summary prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme—the complex, double-edged nature of hope—emerges organically from the narrative's central conceit. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image: the bonfire reduced to a "simple, enduring ember." This powerfully reconfigures the story's central question, providing a non-literal answer that lingers with compelling ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of reconciling principles with reality emerges organically from the conflict. However, the story occasionally resorts to thematic statements that feel like authorial summary, such as "Self-respect meant acknowledging her own lapse... Compassion meant seeing only the creature..." This direct articulation ("Thematic Echo") in a key moment flattens the subtext and prevents the theme from resonating as deeply as it could have through purely demonstrated action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of healing—learning to listen to trauma rather than dissecting it—emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a couple of lines approach thematic summary ("The scar wasn’t a wound to close; it was a story demanding to be heard"), which slightly over-articulates the otherwise elegant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of love's persistence through memory and intention is potent and well-integrated into the central metaphor of film. However, the final act includes a "thematic echo" in the line, "The crystal gazer had found where unused love is stored: in the act of remembering, in the spaces we cherish." This explicit summary slightly undermines the resonance of the more powerful closing images, like the lyric finding its tune.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of creativity's essential nature and the cost of its suppression emerges organically from image and action, never through statement. The story's redefinition of "rest" from passivity to a "focused channeling" is a sophisticated conceptual layer. The final image of the freed stardust provides a resonant, non-literal resolution that powerfully answers the story's central question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of finding hope and new life within broken systems is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the central imagery. The final image of roots pushing through cracked earth is a perfect, resonant answer to the story's central question. The piece avoids easy moralizing, though a single line stating Kael's new motivation borders on being overly explicit, slightly undermining the otherwise impeccable subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reconciling order and wildness emerges organically from the story's central puzzle and resonant final image. However, the ending succumbs to thematic summary. Lines like "The wild frontier wasn’t out there—it was the hum within" state the moral directly, replacing the resonant power of the scene with an unnecessary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—that courage is a process, not a possession—emerges organically from the allegorical journey. The final image of the star glowing on her palm is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, the guide's dialogue comes very close to stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the subtext. This thematic echo, while fitting for the archetypal voice, prevents the theme from feeling entirely discovered by the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of survival's price is potent and emerges organically from the story's core elements. The final image of the bolt on the piano is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is lowered by moments of thematic summary, particularly the line "Elara understood the fortress’s terrible arithmetic," which explicitly states the theme rather than allowing it to remain purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of truth versus illusion is woven seamlessly into the plot, character, and setting, culminating in a "graceful collapse of illusion" that feels earned rather than stated. The narrative resists a simple moral, instead offering a resonant final image of the rune glowing on Elara’s palm as the library stands "ready to record a new reign." This final moment provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of true power.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of irreversible consequences—that stopping a cause doesn't erase its effects—emerges organically from the plot. It avoids any moralizing, instead letting the weight of the discovery speak for itself. The final image of the station keeping "vigil over the drowned world" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about loss and memory. The subtext is carried beautifully through recurring motifs like the tapping and the atlas page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding hope in ruin emerges organically from the imagery and action, culminating in a powerful final image. However, the line "the rebellion’s true enemy wasn’t the oligarchs, but despair" is an overt thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext. This moment of telling, rather than showing, prevents an otherwise masterful thematic execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of evolving tradition versus blind repetition emerges organically from the conflict and finds a resonant, non-literal answer in the image of the new hybrid plant. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme directly. The final paragraph, with lines like "knowing she had honored tradition by changing it," over-articulates the point, weakening an otherwise powerful and nuanced thematic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is powerful and emerges organically from the character's actions and setting, the story falters by explicitly stating its thesis multiple times. Lines like "Realism was the erosion... optimism was the stubborn bloom" function as a thematic summary, a significant flaw that distrusts the reader and undermines the narrative's otherwise potent subtext. This direct moralizing prevents the piece from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the narrative's central conceits rather than being stated. The idea that beauty lies in fragmentation is earned through the protagonist’s struggle, not delivered as a sermon. The final image of the lighthouse beam turning from "fractured" to "fluid" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, reweighting the entire story with a sense of hard-won grace.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—the nature of perception and suffering—emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant and brutal insight. The story brilliantly subverts the idea of time slowing as a moment of grace, reframing it as a biological mechanism for amplifying horror. The final image of Silas in the indifferent desert provides a non-literal answer to her quest that is complex, chilling, and avoids any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of truth versus power emerges organically from the conflict. The final image of the crowd's roar provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the recurring thematic keywords ("unspoken conversation," "contraband truths") are slightly over-articulated, bordering on thematic echo, which prevents the subtext from operating with maximum subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of nurturing as a form of defiance against violence is potent and beautifully integrated through the central motifs of the roses and the engraved "quiet." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, a few lines, such as the explicit statement of her motivation ("to weave continuity through chaos") and the final sentence summarizing the theme, verge on thematic echo, slightly reducing the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding a new, wilder form of harmony within chaos is developed with subtlety and power. The story avoids any overt statements, allowing the theme to emerge from the central conflict. The final image of the "feral lullaby for a broken world" is a perfect, non-literal resolution that reweights the initial problem and lingers with potent ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of truth versus fabrication, anchored by the celestial motifs of orbits and satellites, is woven elegantly throughout. The father's maxim, "Time doesn’t lie," serves as a strong thematic core without feeling preachy. The final image of the "man-made truth" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, providing a powerful and earned sense of thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of integrating trauma rather than erasing it is handled with sophistication, culminating in a resonant final image of the tether. The story avoids a simplistic moral. However, the theme is stated a bit too directly in the mother's letter ("It wasn’t your fault. It was the machine’s truth."), which verges on telling the reader the story's meaning rather than letting it fully emerge from the resonant action of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding order within chaos is beautifully integrated through the central image of the mandala. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "Meaning wasn't a straight line; it was a spiral" and "in the mess, there was always a pattern" feel like authorial summary, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at moments that should resonate with imagery alone. This thematic echoing is a significant weakness in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "aberrant mercy" as a more difficult but necessary path than simple vengeance is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally lapses into stating its theme directly, as with the line about mercy that "terrifies those building monuments to their own righteousness." This slightly undermines the subtext, replacing emergent discovery with explicit commentary, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding hope within an unchangeable tragedy emerges organically from the story’s events. It avoids simplistic morals by rejecting a total fix in favor of a small, meaningful act of grace. The final image of the coin, now bearing a "saved tear," is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the central problem of Elara's despair, reweighting her entire existence from a story of failure to one of enduring, effective love.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated, contrasting a forced, technological connection with an organic, embodied understanding. The fractal pattern in the muscovite serves as a recurring image that gains meaning, beautifully connecting the natural world to the hidden pathways of the brain. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped here because the final sentences—"It wasn’t telepathy. It was something better..."—verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of connection across time is beautifully rendered through concrete imagery rather than exposition. The fossil's transformation from a personal transitional object to a communal message provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of post-cataclysm isolation. The final realization that the coast is a "living archive" lands with significant weight, reframing the entire story without stating a simplistic moral. The theme emerges organically from the plot's central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of reinterpreting inherited wisdom is woven beautifully through the story's core conceit. However, the piece occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, such as "Shared wisdom wasn’t in the words alone..." and "wisdom wasn’t owned, but passed like buttons from hand to hand." These moments, while articulate, border on thematic summary, slightly undermining the power of the story's potent imagery. This explicit moralizing prevents a 9+ score, but the theme's emergence from the central action remains very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of mending what is broken and finding dormant courage is central, but its delivery is too explicit. Key thematic phrases are stated directly in the narration and character thought, particularly in the final paragraph ("the unused courage had been within him all along... even broken things... could mend"). This "Thematic Echo" undercuts the resonance that the story's powerful images and actions otherwise would have earned on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of mending, of finding an enduring thread in decay, is elegantly woven through the story, culminating in the final image. The "palimpsest promise" is a powerful central motif. However, the story occasionally leans into stating its themes a bit too directly with phrases like "distill complexity into essence" and "reinforced truth." These moments of abstraction slightly undercut the otherwise powerful subtext emerging purely from action and image, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of kindness as a persistent, generative force is potent and well-developed through recurring motifs. However, the story repeatedly undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. Lines like "It wasn’t the soil or stone resisting change; it was the accumulated weight of kindness" function as Thematic Echoes, explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting the powerful imagery resonate on its own. This direct moralizing caps the score in an otherwise strong category.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding hope and creating protection through illumination rather than walls emerges organically from the story's central action. The final image of the cat bathed in light provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of darkness. The only minor weakness is the locksmith's quote and the phrase "her wistfully pragmatic heart understanding," which verge on stating the theme directly rather than leaving it fully submerged in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of coexistence emerges organically from the Aethon's history and Elara's personal struggle. The final image is resonant, but its power is slightly diminished by a line that explicitly summarizes the thematic takeaway: "independence wasn't forgetting, but coexisting..." This moment of telling rather than showing is a notable flaw, as it preempts the reader's own synthesis of the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of authentic connection versus curated sentiment emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments where the theme is stated too directly, such as labeling the nest a "tangible symbol," which pre-empts the reader's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding truth amidst "power plays"—both cosmic and terrestrial—is woven through the narrative with great skill. The parallel between the tricksters' signal and the political maneuvering is effective and avoids feeling forced. The final image of the clear signal set against the divided community provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension. The concluding line, while powerful, verges on stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of order versus entropy, and the limits of technical solutions for spiritual problems, emerges organically from the plot. The story masterfully avoids didacticism, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central questions in the final lines. The closing realization that "healing demanded more than just a tool" is earned through the preceding events and provides a complex, lingering emotional aftereffect that reweights the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of seeing beyond the superficial is powerfully embodied in the face-blind artist and her final portrait. Unfortunately, the story's conclusion resorts to explicit thematic statements ("The dormant empathy, awakened," "rediscovered humanity"). This moralizing in the final beats replaces earned resonance with a summary, significantly weakening the thematic impact by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of truth versus historical record is developed organically through the plot, not assertion. The final image of the nail as a "key turning in the lock of history" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about bravery and honor. The re-evaluation of "reversible exile" is particularly insightful, shifting it from a personal to a historical concept.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    A potent theme of finding renewal in fragments is anchored by a brilliant final image. However, the story severely undermines its own subtext through repeated, explicit thematic statements. Phrases like "pixelated amnesty" and "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" function as authorial labels that explain the theme to the reader directly, flattening the potential for discovery and resonant ambiguity. This thematic echo is a significant flaw in an otherwise conceptually strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of cyclical paths and the violation of territory is deeply integrated and resonant. However, the story occasionally veers into thematic summary, particularly in the final paragraphs. Lines like "Veridian Path’s rise and fall mirrored the highway robber’s trajectory" and "His father stole money... Elias had stolen time and trust" state the theme too directly, replacing earned resonance with explanation. This slightly undermines an otherwise powerful thematic conclusion, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of communal strength versus isolation emerges organically from the story’s core imagery and plot. However, the final paragraph dips into overt summary ("Its builders had known that healing began when burdens were distributed..."), a mild case of "Thematic Echo" that states the moral instead of fully trusting the resonant image to carry it. This slight authorial intrusion in the final moments prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thematic exploration of truth versus reflection is woven skillfully into the narrative, culminating in the powerful image of the shattering confession. However, the story’s final sentence ("knowing some truths could only be found when you stopped hiding from them") is an on-the-nose thematic statement that summarizes the moral. This explicit moralizing at the very end slightly undermines the resonance of the preceding images, incurring a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of healing through embracing painful history emerges organically from the story’s central images: linking scars, the re-purposed roots, and the maze clipping. The final image of planting the clipping provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core conflict. The theme is powerful, with only a few phrases like "embracing pain as a thread, not a wall" nearing overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of consequence and the true cost of bargains emerges organically from the story’s central conflict and imagery, particularly the burned tarot card. The narrative resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex resolution about endurance and holding space. The final image of Elara humming while bound is a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest to "patch holes," transforming her idealism into a form of stark, necessary duty.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme is expertly woven through the narrative, emerging organically from the central object and Liam’s internal struggle. The story explores how meaning is found not in perfection but in memory, imperfection, and repair. The final image of the quarry as a space "waiting for the next note" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about purpose without resorting to moralizing. The line "Purpose wasn't found in flawless displays..." lands as an earned epiphany, not a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic resonance is the story's crowning achievement. It masterfully explores the boundary between scientific understanding and experiential truth without a single line of exposition. The final image of Aris, hand on the glass, embodies the theme of "beautiful, heartbreaking proximity," offering a profound, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry that lingers with the reader long after the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in transience and renewal through contradiction emerges organically from the story's central conceits. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "Routine wasn’t emptiness; it was the vessel holding wonder" are powerful but state the theme directly, preventing the piece from achieving perfect thematic resonance through purely implicit means.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the theme of connection overcoming isolation is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story does not trust its imagery, resorting to explicit thematic statements that undermine the subtext. Lines like "The walls weren’t stone; they were fear" and "dissolve the walls between hearts" function as moralizing summaries, severely weakening the resonance of the otherwise powerful final image by explaining it to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of forgiveness through surrender is powerfully integrated into the character's actions and the story's imagery, it suffers from over-articulation. The graffiti ("The river forgives what the mind cannot") and journal entry ("The path isn't charted; it's walked") function as explicit thematic statements, a form of "Thematic Echo" that tells the reader the moral rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's theme—the relationship between time, truth, and suppressed knowledge—emerges organically from the central conceit. The watch's engraving, "Time Lies, But Light Tells," elegantly frames the narrative's core rule-set. The final image of the library holding a "luminous breath" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for "unspoken words," leaving a powerful thematic aftereffect without resorting to direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of choosing cultivation over control emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraph. The line "destiny wasn’t in objects, but in seeds sown unseen" is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the story's meaning, undercutting the subtextual power of the propagated bloom and providing a moral where a resonant image would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of preserving memory and meaning against total annihilation emerges organically from the character’s actions and the powerful central imagery. The final image of the glowing emerald is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core dilemma. However, the final sentence, "infusing hope into the endless night," is a thematic echo that slightly undermines the preceding image by stating the theme directly, pulling back from what would have been a near-perfect close.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of rebirth through forgiveness and care is elegantly woven through the story’s central metaphors. However, the piece falters by occasionally stating its theme directly, which undermines the subtext. The line, "She would teach others this truth: that to find contentment, one must first become kindly decisive in the face of despair," reads as an explicit moral, a thematic summary that weakens the otherwise resonant, image-driven conclusion, incurring a notable penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of nuance versus false certainty emerges powerfully from the story’s core conflict and imagery, particularly in the final resonant image of the mirror shard. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic statement. The line, "Nuance wasn’t weakness; it was the only true certainty," functions as a thematic echo in the final third, a flaw that prevents an otherwise exceptional thematic execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme is powerfully embodied in the central metaphor of the pond and Elara's physical change. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic statement. Lines like "her motivation clear: to teach vanishing to appear" and the final explanation "withholding truth lets it root deeper" function as authorial summary within the character's thoughts, slightly reducing the resonance that the powerful imagery otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is handled with exceptional grace, emerging organically from the central images of stone, bone, dust, and flight. The story explores profound ideas of stillness, deep time, and transmitted wisdom without a single line of overt moralizing. The final action—placing the arrowhead back as "a seed for the next seeker"—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core quest that elevates the narrative beyond a personal epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of authentic, imperfect creation versus optimized output is potent and well-integrated through imagery like the "cracked teacups" and the snowflake. However, the story occasionally lapses into overt thematic statements that undermine the subtext. The line "she would never again mistake automation for art" in the final paragraphs is a thematic echo that summarizes the earned insight instead of letting the final image carry the full weight, incurring a penalty for stating the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the synthesis of light, sound, memory, and water. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without resorting to moralizing. The idea that vows are "echoes absorbed" and require "both darkness and light to be understood" is a sophisticated and earned thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding order and purpose within chaos emerges organically from the central action of distilling a signal from noise. The backwards prophecy is re-weighted beautifully at the climax, providing a resonant answer to the story's central question. The final sentence, however, verges on stating the theme directly, a minor slip that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful use of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme—that naming fear disarms it—is beautifully integrated, moving from Kael’s stated belief to a demonstrated truth. The final image of the sea monsters as "companions rather than phantoms" is a superb, non-literal resolution that reweights the initial premise. The story trusts the image to convey the theme without resorting to a final summary.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of small, persistent devotion triumphing over grand, roaring power emerges organically from the story's particulars. It avoids any moralizing, instead letting the central action—mending a fracture through understanding rhythm, not force—embody the core idea. The final image is a masterclass in thematic resonance, a non-literal answer to the story's central question: a single trickle of water doesn't fix a drought, but it ends the silence, reweighting the prior despair with fragile, earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory, storytelling, and humane silence is potent and well-conceived. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final paragraphs by explicitly stating its thematic conclusions ("He had spun stories into shared meaning... shielding them from the jagged edges of loss"). This "thematic echo" replaces earned resonance with a direct explanation, preventing the final image from doing that work on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of balancing reason and instinct emerges organically from the central conflict. The final realization that wonder is "the bridge" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The recurring motifs of the locket and the grandmother's words effectively deepen the theme. The score is slightly capped because the final few paragraphs come close to stating the theme directly ("wonder had been the catalyst, not the casualty"), which somewhat diminishes the subtextual power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the themes of trust and responsibility are coherent, they are stated too explicitly and frequently, bordering on didacticism. Phrases like "Trust dies in the gap between knowing and doing" and the protagonist's self-identification as a "midwife to trust" function as thematic summaries that undermine subtext. This over-articulation prevents the theme from emerging organically from the well-executed plot and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of resolving duality ("complementary opposites") is powerfully integrated into the climax. However, the final paragraphs resort to explicit thematic summary, a significant flaw. Lines like "It was about giving life meaning through the very opposites that defined existence" state the moral directly, undermining the resonance of the preceding action and weakening the ending's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is central but its execution is undermined by a lack of subtext. The story repeatedly states its thesis, for example: "This was the essence of safeguarding space." The final paragraphs devolve into direct moralizing, explaining that the seed is a "symbol" of "quiet courage," which severely weakens the resonant image of the planted seed by over-explaining its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of transforming sorrow through ritual is executed with exceptional grace and originality. There are no direct statements or morals; instead, the theme emerges organically from the central conceit of the leaf blower symphony. The final image of laughter echoing down the tunnel's "stone throat" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful and lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges powerfully from the story’s central conflict and resolution. The final image of light and mist in dialogue is a sublime, non-literal answer to the story’s core question. However, the score is slightly tempered by a moment of thematic echo ("The boundaries of light weren’t walls... but thresholds... the mist wasn’t an enemy..."), where the story explains its own metaphor, a minor intrusion that slightly undermines the otherwise superb subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of "creative destruction" is seamlessly integrated, moving from an abstract idea to a concrete, triumphant act. The story avoids any moralizing, instead using the final image of the "frozen bloom made manifest" as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of failure. This final image beautifully recharges the earlier description of Aris's stoic expression, creating a sophisticated and emotionally satisfying thematic loop.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of cyclical existence is powerfully dramatized in the central image of a nebula's birth from a star's death. However, the story slightly undermines its own earned resonance with thematic statements that feel like authorial summary. The final line, "endings were merely tuning forks for the next beginning," is an explicit thematic echo that caps an otherwise outstanding execution.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding connection within chaos emerges organically from the plot's mechanics. The final, reconfigured image of the hourglass as a "promise of time remade" provides a powerful, non-literal conclusion. However, the final paragraph dips into direct thematic summary ("Leo chose to believe in the light between the fractures"), slightly undermining the otherwise excellent resonance built through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme emerges with potent subtlety, arguing that true connection is not an elegant pattern but a "sinewy, demanding" act of shared vulnerability. The story avoids any moralizing, allowing the theme to crystallize in Elara's final realization and the closing image of memories braided into scars. This offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of navigating the boundary between known and unknown is powerfully integrated, especially through the anchor link motif. The final image of the city as a cradle is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the closing lines come precariously close to over-stating the theme, particularly "proof that curiosity... could turn even drowned light into a compass," which slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of love enduring beyond death emerges organically from the plot. However, the final two sentences resort to explicit thematic summary ("proving that the most vulnerable voices... could mend the world’s fractures" and "love, once traced, never truly fades"). This direct moralizing undermines the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with a stated thesis, a significant flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of honoring the “unremembered” is powerfully integrated into the plot and Arden’s motivation, culminating in a resonant final image. The core concept of the cables as a silent archive provides a strong, non-literal exploration of memory and legacy. The score is capped just below the 9+ band due to the slightly overt repetition of the thematic phrase "to stand by the unremembered," which borders on stating the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding wisdom in error is powerfully integrated and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the story occasionally lapses into stating its theme directly, as in "Failure had hidden a bridge between cosmic rhythms and mortal fragility." This direct thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph functions as a "Thematic Echo," slightly undermining the subtext and preventing the theme from emerging purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, language, and imperfect creation without a single line of exposition. The theme emerges from the central metaphor of translating texture into sound, and the flawed diamond serves as a perfect vehicle for the idea that beauty and meaning can arise from imperfection, even if transiently. The final line, "a victory across his language's death," provides a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting impression of poignant success.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of transforming grief into grace is potent and explored with originality through the "cosmic joke" metaphor. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about loss. However, the theme is occasionally stated too explicitly, particularly in the final third (e.g., "Bitterness had been the joke all along..."), which slightly undermines the subtext by summarizing what the imagery and action have already powerfully demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of beauty reawakening through resonant connection rather than force emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the sprout is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final paragraph comes close to over-stating its theme ("the persistent, resonant language of the heart"), but is sufficiently grounded in the preceding action ("She hadn't just signaled; she had synchronized") to avoid feeling like unearned moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict of connection versus control. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the drone as a "necessary stitch in the healing"—that provides a non-literal answer to the question of mending "broken promises." This final beat powerfully recharges the story's core ideas of hope and resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding life and creation within silence and decay emerges organically from the story’s central images and actions. The final image of the permanently lit oasis is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements, particularly the final line's thesis: "silence... becomes the most fertile ground of all," which feels like an unnecessary authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme exploring the tangible, living soul of stories in an age of digital ephemerality is woven beautifully through the narrative's core concept of "analog memories." The story avoids didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge organically from Elara's quest. The final image of her as a guardian offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, achieving a profound thematic resonance without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is masterfully integrated. The concept of a message hidden not in pigment but in light becomes a powerful metaphor for hope and memory. The final lines, reframing the "luminous absence" from an emptiness to "a canvas waiting for the right light," provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central emotional question without ever stating a moral. This is thematic execution at its best.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme is potent and emerges organically from the central metaphor for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs slip into overt thematic summary, directly stating the story's "secret" multiple times ("the secret wasn't the starlight, but the knowledge..."). This redundancy undercuts the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with a moralizing echo that feels less confident than the preceding scene-work.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story explores themes of memory, trauma, and reappraisal with nuance and depth, culminating in a resonant final image. The core thematic turn—recasting an act of perceived violence as one of protection—is beautifully executed. A minor deduction is for a couple of aphoristic lines ("the land remembers what people forget") that state the theme a little too directly, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic development is very strong, emerging organically from the central conceit of mending what is broken. The story brilliantly uses the shard, the shadow, and Kael's insight to explore redemption without ever resorting to direct moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped here because the final sentence states the theme too explicitly ("a testament to how tenderness... could mend what exile broke"), slightly undermining thesubtlety that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of wonder's resilience is powerfully woven through the central conceit and imagery, culminating in a resonant final image. The story excels at showing this theme through action. However, the final paragraph includes the line "wonder lived in the weave, not the wound," which functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral rather than allowing the final image to carry the full weight of meaning, slightly undermining the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of healing through acknowledgment of trauma is woven deeply into the story’s central conceit and actions. The transformation of silence from a "burden" to a "balm" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question about grief. The piece is slightly held back by a few lines that articulate the theme too directly ("silence no longer a burden but a balm"), which momentarily lessens the subtext's power but doesn't break the overall effect.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of listening—of interpreting silence as a language rather than an absence—emerges organically from every action and image. The story resists simple moralizing until the final line, which risks being an explicit "thematic echo." However, framing "Silence is not absence. It is a map waiting to be framed" as her professional survey note brilliantly contextualizes it as an earned, character-specific conclusion rather than authorial intrusion. This final Conceptual Repricing recharges the entire narrative with profound meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central theme, exploring release through the metaphor of tensile strength, is potent. Unfortunately, the story violates the principle of subtext at its climax. The note from Eleanor explicitly states the theme ("Letting go isn’t breaking; it’s releasing the frequency that binds"), which reads as an authorial explanation rather than an organic, earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of connection, loneliness, and art's power to give voice to the unspoken emerge organically from the story’s central conceit. The subtextual parallel between the ghost's isolation and Elara's grief-choked silence is potent and resolves beautifully. The final image of the harmonizing song is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions, though the final sentence slightly over-articulates the thematic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding joy within anguish emerges organically from the diary and Elara's memories. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, particularly in the final lines: "anguish was the ice, but joy was the sun that would always, eventually, find a way through." This explicit moralizing undercuts the resonance of the final image, stating the theme rather than allowing it to be fully embodied by the action.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory and connection is beautifully integrated until the final paragraphs. The coda, which explains the "Vance Spiral" and its legacy, over-moralizes and deflates the powerful ambiguity of Elara's personal discovery. The line "We are never truly gone" is a thematic statement that replaces earned resonance with a tidy, sentimental summary, significantly weakening an otherwise profound ending.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of embracing imperfection and valuing the attempt over the outcome emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the flawed mirror is a powerful, resonant symbol. The score is slightly capped because the final two sentences lean towards stating the theme directly, fractionally undermining the subtext that was so masterfully built.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven seamlessly through the story's central conceit, with "earth-patterns mirroring sky-truths" moving from a phrasebook quote to a dramatized reality. The conceptual repricing of "stranded luminance" from a state of being trapped to a beacon for navigation is the story's most resonant achievement. The final image provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's questions about perception and finding one's way.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of repair as an act of listening rather than force is woven beautifully through the narrative, culminating in the climax. The "driftwood nostalgia" motif is particularly effective, gaining new weight at the story's close. However, the explicit statement, "repair wasn't conquest, but communion," while earned, is a slight thematic echo that momentarily states what the preceding action has already so powerfully shown. This minor underscoring is the only element holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of collective hope and trust triumphing over individual despair emerges organically from the plot. The opening motif of "brambled hope" is beautifully reprised in the final line, creating a resonant thematic frame. The final image of the nebula manifest in the water provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the colony's plight, only slightly diminished by a preceding sentence that explicitly summarizes the ghost's altruistic motive.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding hope in imperfection ("beautifully flawed") is woven seamlessly through the narrative, connecting the puppet, the protagonist, and the saved world. The final image of the puppet's eye reflecting a "prism of hope" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about memory and sacrifice. The piece avoids moralizing, allowing its complex emotional aftereffect—bruised awe—to land with full force.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning or beauty in graceless, mandated duty emerges organically from the plot. The final line—"wondered if guiding others was the key to her own freedom"—is a slight misstep, articulating the central thematic question a little too directly. While phrased as a thought, it verges on a thematic summary, slightly weakening an otherwise subtle and resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of transformation through separation is potent and well-integrated with the story's core metaphors, its execution is marred by heavy-handed thematic statements. The narrative repeatedly summarizes its own meaning (e.g., "separation wasn’t termination but transformation," "His atonement wouldn’t be punishment; it would be purpose"). This direct moralizing, especially in the story's second half, undermines the power of the imagery and prevents the theme from resonating with genuine subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is masterfully handled, emerging from the synthesis of character, setting, and action without a single instance of overt statement. The final image—the measured void becoming a lens for a nascent story—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of where stories begin. It brilliantly re-contextualizes the entire narrative, resisting a simple moral in favor of a profound conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of transforming individual trauma through shared experience is powerfully rendered through the central culinary metaphor. The final image of the broth provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's initial quest for solitary healing. A few moments, like the direct statement "the pavilion wasn’t a tomb, but a crucible," are slightly too explicit, pulling back from perfect subtext and capping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection being a form of sonic and empathetic resonance is woven beautifully through the story's core metaphors. The final image of the farmers gathering, drawn by the music, provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the initial problem of isolation. While phrases like "stitched the city’s soul to the soil" verge on thematic summary, the story primarily relies on its central conceit to convey meaning, avoiding simple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict, focusing on memory, hope, and purpose found in fragmentation. The broken mirror is a powerful, evolving motif that shifts from a symbol of loss to a conduit of resurrected beauty. The final line—"It felt like the beginning of an excavation"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thematic concepts like "vigilance," "seed," and "blaze" are over-articulated, appearing so frequently that they lose resonance and feel like prompt fulfillment. The story states its theme directly multiple times, culminating in the final paragraph ("This knowledge was not just to be kept; it was to be sown..."). This heavy-handedness undermines the potential for subtext and earned thematic discovery, replacing emergent meaning with explicit summary.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding connection and voice through deep listening emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor. The final image powerfully resonates without stating a moral. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as the direct label "This is empathy in motion" and the slightly too-perfect wisdom of the teacher's quote. These moments of telling, rather than showing, prevent the theme from reaching the highest echelon of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding resilient beauty within betrayal and difficulty emerges organically from the central metaphor of chess and constellations. The final image of the hidden-but-unbroken covenant is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece verges on overstatement with lines like "The game was never about winning, but the beauty of the play," which come close to summarizing the theme rather than letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is central and developed, but its execution lacks subtlety at crucial moments. The diary's final line, "True silence isn’t empty. It’s the space where you finally hear the other’s breath," functions as a direct thematic statement. This is compounded by the story's final sentence, "Elara began to heal the world," an unearned, sentimental leap that replaces a resonant personal insight with a hollow, grand pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding serenity within motion is thoughtfully integrated into the plot and character arc. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement, especially in the moment of epiphany and the final paragraph. The concluding sentence, which explains the seed has become a "teacher" and a "testament," functions as a thematic summary, weakening the resonance that the potent final image of the unfurling leaf could have achieved on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of resilience as absorbed, remembered failure is powerful and emerges organically from the plot's mechanics. However, the final paragraph succumbs to "Thematic Echo," explicitly stating the story's conclusion ("resilience wasn’t found—it was gathered..."). This authorial summary undermines the otherwise elegant conclusion, preventing the final image from carrying the thematic weight on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic development is sophisticated, emerging organically from action and observation rather than statement. The core theme—the limits of foresight in the face of complex, chaotic systems—is embodied in Elara's struggle to map the invisible wind. The flight engineer's patch serves as a perfect motif, its meaning deepening from a piece of evidence to a symbol of her promise, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is severely undermined by constant, explicit repetition. Instead of emerging from imagery, the story repeatedly states its thesis, such as "wonder was the bedrock of meaning" and "wonder is essential, as vital as breath." This heavy-handed moralizing, especially in the final third, functions as a Thematic Echo anti-pattern that drains the story of subtext and resonance, telling the reader what to feel instead of earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of surrender versus command emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the line "true guardianship required surrender, not command" is a thematic echo, stating the story's core insight too directly. While the word "bitter" grounds it in character, this moment of telling slightly lessens the power of what was otherwise shown.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of empathy as an unsolvable, essential current is explored with nuance and depth. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the central metaphor of the letterpress and the fragment to pose its questions through image and action. The final realization, while explicit, feels earned as a necessary conclusion to Aris’s analytical quest, and the final image of setting type for a simple notice provides a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative fabric without a single line of overt moralizing. The concept of "coaxing wonder from the routine" is not just stated but dramatized through the story's central event. The final realization that "Today’s miracle would become tomorrow’s legend... stripped of this raw, personal awe" provides a resonant, complex, and non-literal answer to the story's questions about memory and meaning, perfectly meeting the 9+ standard.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of subjective projection versus objective reality emerges organically from the central conflict, avoiding any didacticism until the earned moment of revelation. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, recasting Elara's future work not as a failure, but as a more honest endeavor. The concept of "truthful lies" is a powerful thematic anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    The themes of sacrifice, remembrance, and hope against futility emerge organically from the story's central actions and resonant imagery. The contrast between the vibrant "sunlit meadow" on the puzzle and Elara's "bamboo prison" provides potent subtext. The final image—a single "spark across the void" born of total self-annihilation—offers a powerful, non-didactic answer to the story's central question of purpose, leaving a lingering, complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding strength in vulnerability and the nature of sacrifice emerges organically from the story's events. The central concept of "bartered awakenings" serves as a potent thematic engine. While the final image is resonant, the prose occasionally articulates the theme a bit too directly ("To coax resilience from the rubble, he had to offer his own deepest vulnerability"), slightly reducing the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the story's core conflict and central conceit of "weaving." The final understanding of sacrifice is not stated as a moral but is felt as a "profound, resonant gravity," offering a non-literal and deeply satisfying answer to the story's central question. The final image of carrying the weight as a compass is a perfect thematic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the story's central images: the extinguished lamp, the sea glass, the stacked stones. The final image of the "lighthouse of the soul" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question about hope. A few phrases in the last third, like "quiet rebellion against despair," verge on stating the theme, a minor slip in an otherwise impeccable execution.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding strength in imperfection is masterfully woven into the plot, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the story slightly undermines its own elegance with an explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph ("using brokenness to mend, shadows to illuminate"). This moment of telling what was just powerfully shown keeps an otherwise outstanding thematic execution just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of listening versus telling is thoughtfully explored through the central metaphor. However, the story falters by stating its theme too explicitly at the end. The journal's passage ("Stories cling to those who offer the quiet space...") and Elara's final dialogue function as direct moralizing, which significantly reduces the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of grief as a form of connection, healed by being witnessed rather than erased, is potent and beautifully developed. The final image of the labyrinth as a witness provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's conclusions ("Quantified sorrow wasn't a measure of loss, but of connection..."). This over-articulation slightly dilutes the subtext and incurs a penalty for thematic echo, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that the strength of a world lies not in grand rituals but in small, intimate acts of community—emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the re-knitted communities is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. It avoids moralizing, instead offering a powerful, earned vision of resilience and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding wisdom in imperfection and connection is central and well-integrated. However, its delivery via the inscription in the book ("The greatest mistake is believing wisdom lives only in perfection...") is too direct. This moment functions as a "thematic echo," stating the story's core message explicitly rather than allowing the reader to fully infer it from Elara's experience, which slightly lessens the resonance of her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of finding sacredness in ordinary acts of remembrance and care amidst collapse is beautifully realized. It emerges organically from the story’s central images: the bread, the seeds, the locket. The final conversation and closing image provide a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's initial despair. The score is held just below the 9-band because the repeated phrase "tenuous absolution" borders on a thematic statement, slightly over-articulating the story's core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of preserving memory and meaning in the face of entropy is woven into every element of the story. It emerges organically from the central conflict rather than being stated. The final image of the cryo-vial—a "seed of meaning"—is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding a simple moral. The juxtaposition of immense loss (the faded world) and small, hard-won hope gives the theme a profound and lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of trust's fragility is woven organically through the plot, connecting Elara’s personal history to the market's social contract. The final image of her walking into the dawn with the recording provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest for clarity. The final paragraphs border on overstating the theme ("it proved trust broke the same way everywhere"), but the "hollow victory" provides enough ambiguity to avoid simple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable economy. The story explores humanity's fractured relationship with the biosphere, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to its central questions. The final line, "because someone had to remember how to hold the sky," is a powerful, earned conclusion that avoids moralizing. A slight deduction for the slightly too-explicit phrase "Aris realized with dawning clarity," which briefly tells what is otherwise shown magnificently.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of confronting failure to unlock creativity emerges organically from the story's central symbols and actions. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The piece is only held back from a higher score by a single line of overly direct thematic summary ("could she fix what was fractured within herself?"), which momentarily states what the rest of the story shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of truth's restorative power is masterfully woven into the plot mechanics, elevating it beyond mere statement. The final image of Elara blooming provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The line "*candor in small moments reassembles what force cannot*" verges on being an overly explicit thematic statement, which is the only minor friction in an otherwise seamless thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of preserving memory and non-verbal truth in a fading world emerges powerfully from the central images of the ancient ice and the kinetic sculptures. The final beat is thematically resonant, landing without a tidy moral. However, the score is held back by moments of overt thematic statement, such as explicitly defining Elara's motivation, which slightly undermine the otherwise superb subtextual work.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding wholeness in perceived flaws is beautifully woven through the narrative, emerging from the imagery of static, memory, and the "strangely organic" box. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a Thematic Echo. The explicit statement "Nostalgia wasn’t a flaw—it was the compass that guided him home" summarizes the theme directly, preempting reader discovery and weakening an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story's theme is powerful, but its delivery is heavy-handed, violating the principle of emergence. The final paragraphs explicitly state the moral multiple times ("listening had woven them back together," "the power of stories shared," "This simple act of listening... was the strongest thread"). This thematic moralizing replaces the resonance that should arise from the final image, significantly weakening the piece's literary impact for a discerning audience.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of encrypting vulnerability as strength is woven deeply into the plot, character, and resolution, creating a cohesive and intelligent core. However, the story undermines its own subtlety by stating its theme explicitly multiple times, most notably in the line, “Strength wasn’t the absence of fear, but its precise, encrypted choreography.” This direct moralizing, however eloquent, feels like an authorial intrusion that preempts reader discovery, a significant flaw in a piece aiming for the highest literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory as a preserved, rather than lost, force is beautifully integrated through the central conceit of "memory wells." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The piece mostly avoids moralizing, letting the events speak for themselves. However, the final realization, "the pockets weren’t thieves but keepers," borders on a thematic echo, slightly over-articulating the story's thesis in the closing moments, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of imposing measured silence upon chaotic noise is developed with immense cohesion through recurring imagery like the "smoothed hush." The story’s final image of the spent wing and the quiet brook provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem without ever stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme is the story's greatest strength. The concept of "agreed upon lies" as a sanctuary against loneliness is explored with profound subtlety and emerges organically from the narrative particulars. The final lines avoid any moralizing, instead offering a resonant image of the city's architecture breathing. This ending beautifully reweights the entire story, transforming the central "lie" from a simple fiction into a poetic, life-sustaining truth.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of transforming pain rather than erasing it emerges organically from the central metaphor of archiving. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as "This was the heart of her method: not erasure, but transformation..." and "...charmed not by magic but by the elegant physics of healing," which feels like an authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of "forgiving the unfinished" by healing history is woven seamlessly through character, action, and image, never once resorting to overt statement. The concept of "calibrated treason" provides a complex moral framework that resists easy answers. The final image of the transformed burden provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about legacy, leaving a powerful and lingering emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of knowledge versus enforced silence emerges organically from the conflict and Kaela's personal loss. The final image of her preparing to sing provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. However, the repeated use of the phrase "progressive disclosure" feels like an intrusive thematic label, slightly undermining the otherwise subtle thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of salvaging purity from shame is beautifully developed through the central symbol of the snow globe. The final image, where the globe "looked like a promise," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A minor deduction is warranted for the last paragraph's tendency to state its own conclusion ("She had woven the fractured narrative into something whole"), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of appreciating hidden effort is developed with nuance and poetic force, connecting Kenji's craft, the fireflies, and the ancient fortress. The final tea ceremony is a sublime, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is held just shy of the 9-band because of a few instances of direct thematic statement, such as "His motivation was... to appreciate hidden effort," which slightly undermine the otherwise masterful use of subtext and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of manufactured "comfortable lies" versus the costly, "excavated truth" is woven into every element, from the setting to the "cursed" diamond whose flaw is actually its strength. The story avoids any moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge entirely from the plot's revelation. The final image of Lena walking back into the storm with her evidence is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the responsibility that comes with truth, offering a resonant and complex conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven into the plot mechanics, exploring the necessity of balancing light and dark without resorting to direct statement. The core concept—that "the shadow holds the key, not the flame"—is dramatized through the function of the Portico itself. The final line, "Dawn is woven," serves as a powerful, resonant, and non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of connection across generations is developed organically through resonant images—the jars, the time-worn music box, the shared lullaby. The story avoids any overt moralizing. The final image of capturing the child’s hum is a perfect, non-literal answer to Silas’s yearning, recontextualizing his entire project without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of achieving harmony through precise adaptation rather than force emerges organically from the plot. However, the final line—"found absolution not for sins, but for the world's raw, trembling fragility"—is a thematic statement that borders on authorial moralizing. This over-articulation slightly diminishes the power of the resonant final image, stating what had already been powerfully implied and landing as a Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of patient, collective action being superior to impulsive force emerges organically from the story's central conceits. The final image of the "sculpted" chain shard provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the score is tempered by moments of thematic over-statement, particularly in the final paragraph ("Impatience had been their winter; now, patience bloomed..."), which summarizes the theme a little too neatly instead of letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety. The connection between the historical struggle for freedom (the lantern) and Elara's personal/professional liberation is powerful and deeply resonant. The final image provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question about integrity, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic handling is masterful. The central metaphor of the broken "clockwork heart" is explored with nuance, connecting mechanical repair to spiritual and emotional mending. The theme of deserving forgiveness and peace emerges organically through character action and dialogue, culminating in a resonant final image of the city as a "map of second chances." The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex, earned insight through its particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the resonant idea that the journey surpasses the destination. The final image of the singing shards and Zephyr beginning anew is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The line "the ringing was the seeking" is a bit too direct and risks summarizing the theme, but it comes after the climax has already done the heavy lifting, functioning as a final crystallization rather than a didactic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory, data permanence, and loss is explored with subtlety and depth. The story's core concept—that the archive "consumes memories"—emerges organically from the plot rather than being stated didactically. The final image of the humming archive ready for its next victim provides a chilling, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, leaving a powerful and lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central theme of mending fractures is powerfully embodied by the crystal ball metaphor. However, the story undermines its own subtlety with explicit thematic statements. The final sentence, "Courage wasn’t the absence of fracture but the will to reconstitute what was broken...", is a declarative moral that replaces the resonance of the final image, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven through recurring imagery—the wind, the ice, the act of trawling—without a single instance of overt moralizing. The concept of finding solace within the process of decay, rather than in escape, emerges with startling clarity. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to her initial quest, transforming the sound of an ending from a terror to be fled into a grace note to be heard.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding beauty in "destined mismatches" emerges organically from the central image of the scorched letter. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic over-articulation, such as "...the destined mismatches in life weren’t failures, but the very fire that shaped understanding," which state the theme too directly, bordering on a "thematic echo" that slightly lessens the power of the otherwise subtle conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through action and imagery, exploring preservation versus entropy without a single line of moralizing. The core idea that true preservation requires alignment with, not opposition to, a powerful force is demonstrated rather than stated. The final image of the echo settling "like dew" in the consecrated clearing provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of collective healing is developed with nuance and emotional honesty, emerging organically from the central conceit of the photographic arcs. The piece avoids sentimentality by grounding its hope in specific, painful images. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding a tidy moral. The score is held just below the 9-band by a few phrases that lean toward direct thematic statement, like "the cracks where light gets in," which, while fitting, slightly reduces subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of language as a living, evolving entity is explored with remarkable depth and subtlety. It emerges organically from the central action, avoiding any didactic statements. The final image of dust motes dancing "like scattered letters" is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, providing a resonant and earned conclusion that lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven into every image and action, exploring memory, time, and the struggle for self-validation without a single line of exposition. The final image of the water droplet—the "plink"—is a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting the entire narrative with a sense of profound, inescapable tragedy. The piece resonates long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of embracing ephemerality is expertly woven through the story's core images—the shaking earth, the spinning clock, and the distant starlight. The final image of the Carina Nebula provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Aris's struggle. However, the line "a testament to harnessing the ephemeral not by freezing time, but by dancing within its current" borders on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding meaning in release is developed through concrete, resonant images—the broken record, the mundane sounds, the rooftop vista. The concept of "hymning the mundane" is a powerful, non-didactic anchor. The final image provides a resonant answer to the central question of what constitutes a "good death," successfully avoiding sentimentality through its grounding in specific sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges with subtlety and power from the story’s core actions, exploring understanding versus force, and healing through a dialogue with past failures. The final image of the key and shadow-shard offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The piece is docked slightly for one line, "closing the loop of her grief with quiet reverence," an explicit thematic summary that feels less elegant than the otherwise masterful subtext woven through the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of healing through accepting brokenness is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphors of bone setting and constellations. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece suffers from several instances of "Thematic Echo," where the theme is stated too directly. The line "Mistakes—like Finn’s fall, like her disbelief—weren’t dead ends but pivot points, constellations charting resilience" is a significant flaw, explaining the story's thesis instead of letting the images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, focusing on the transformation of scars into sources of light. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from Elara's ritual. The final image of the glowing village square serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about loss and purpose, achieving a rare thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in broken things emerges organically from the setting and the central object. However, the resonance is weakened by Mara's final line, "Some wounds are meant to be held up to the light, not buried." This comes too close to a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext that had been built so effectively through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges with profound grace from the story's central conceit and imagery. The narrative masterfully explores transience, acceptance, and the nature of hope without resorting to moralizing. The final image of the broken seashell re-contextualized as a symbol of a different, more resilient hope provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, lingering long after the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory and stories as a healing force is woven beautifully through the central imagery of "golden stories." The concept is resonant and emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph commits a serious flaw by explicitly stating the moral: "...reminded the world that stories are the truest harvest, spun not from gold but from the courage to remember." This thematic echo undermines the subtlety built throughout the piece and is a significant weakness for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of preserving love against the oblivion of time and loss emerges organically from the story’s central magical conceit. The narrative avoids any direct moralizing, instead allowing the final, resonant image of the "safekept sun" to answer the story's core question. This object, created from refuse and memory, becomes a potent, non-literal exploration of how we carry the lost, achieving a thematic depth that is both specific and universal.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's theme emerges with grace and power from its central conceit. The abstract idea of reason preserving wonder is made concrete through the narrative action, culminating in a final image—laughter condensing into a "soft, internal glow"—that provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. While Silas's echoed words come close to a direct statement, they function as an earned discovery within the scene rather than an authorial intrusion, preserving the theme's organic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of calcified burdens and the weaver's curse of consequence. The narrative resists easy answers, culminating in a resonant final image of acceptance and repurposed pain. The story offers a complex, non-literal answer to the problem of carrying sorrow, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of transforming loss is coherent, its execution lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly resorts to direct thematic statements, undermining subtext. The line "she had harvested this truth: grief could be contained, shaped, and made beautiful" is a critical flaw, a "Thematic Echo" that explicitly moralizes in the final third, replacing the resonance of the image with a tidy summary that a top-tier publication would reject.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of regret and the consequence of "looking away" emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final image of the "compass pointing nowhere" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest, avoiding any moralizing. The last line powerfully extends the theme beyond the character, solidifying its depth.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of renewal from decay is powerfully integrated into the story's core action. However, the piece occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext. Phrases like "new equations for hope" and the final paragraph's "Hope, she realized, wasn’t found in grand gestures..." verge on thematic summary. While the sentiment is earned by the preceding events, a more implicit rendering would have been more resonant for a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of accepting imperfection over striving for an impossible ideal emerges organically from the story’s central contrast between mechanical clocks and the wild bear. The final image of the sunrise gilding the clocks resonates beautifully with Elias's newfound peace. The score is slightly capped because the core insight is stated a bit too explicitly in the line, "Peace, he realized with a warmth... wasn’t found in achieving the unattainable, but in releasing its ghost," which borders on thematic moralizing rather than allowing the image to do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of truth versus manufactured history is woven deeply into the narrative through concrete particulars, particularly the sundial's transformation from magical artifact to surveyor's tool. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The piece loses some points for occasionally stating its theme too directly, as with the repeated "architecture of lies," which borders on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.6)
    This is the story's most outstanding feature. Themes of preservation, patient work, and connection to ancestral wisdom emerge organically from every image and action. The central concept of knowledge encoded in rope is explored with subtlety and depth, culminating in a final image—"carried in rope and root and the glass that remembered lightning"—that provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without a whisper of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—that healing is the act of witnessing absence rather than erasing it—emerges with profound organicism from the story's particulars. It avoids didacticism entirely, instead allowing the theme to crystallize in Elara's final actions and thoughts. The closing image of the "map begin[ning] to mend" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to her central quest, reweighting her entire practice without a single moralizing word, a hallmark of exceptional thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of persistence over perfect restoration emerges organically and powerfully from the story’s events. It avoids any didacticism, instead delivering its resonant point through the final, charged image of the flawed chick. The concept of a "flawed genesis" is woven through the narrative, from the shattered crystal cradle to the final creature, offering a complex and lingering answer to the central thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of resilience and finding harmony in scars is powerfully developed through layered imagery. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its thesis in the final act. Her father's platitude, "Scars are just light finding new paths," and her own realization that "every scar held a song" function as thematic summaries, a critical flaw that replaces resonant subtext with a direct moral, weakening an otherwise potent ending.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of memory versus oblivion is woven organically through the story’s central conceit. The final image of water returning as memories are liberated provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. The story successfully avoids moralizing, allowing the resonant action and Elara's quiet hope to carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The themes of creation versus destruction and the persistence of gentle legacies are woven beautifully through the narrative. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The score is slightly tempered by the mother's recorded maxim ("light shared without fire is light that lasts"), which borders on a direct thematic statement rather than pure subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory's living nature versus the permanence of stone emerges organically from the story’s core images. The final realization provides a profound, non-literal answer to the central question without a whisper of moralizing. The image of the butterflies forming a "vessel" is a masterful thematic resolution, complex and emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of redemptive craft and incremental healing is powerfully rendered through action and image, not statement. The final image of the swinging pendulum and the word "now" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the line "incremental absolution had carved its way home" is a thematic echo, a direct summary of the theme in the final paragraph where the action has already made it clear. This unnecessary underlining slightly mars an otherwise masterful execution, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative fabric, exploring remembrance and the persistence of intention through decay. The final image of the cemetery, no longer empty but "filled with the soft, enduring echoes of intentions finally heard," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central puzzle. The piece achieves a powerful thematic resonance without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story's central theme of innovation born from constraint is powerful but undermined by overt and repeated authorial statements. Lines like, "The realm needed more than a thaw; it needed proof that constraint could birth creativity," function as thematic moralizing that replaces earned resonance. This explicit declaration in the final third significantly weakens the story's subtext and emotional aftereffect by telling the reader what to think.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic development is subtle and powerful. The theme of memory and restoration emerges organically from the central conflict and imagery, avoiding any direct moralizing. The final line—"dust remembering how to speak"—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting all prior events with a sense of profound, quiet victory.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in transience emerges powerfully from the central images (mask, ashes, vanishing point). The story avoids a simple moral, offering a complex, resonant conclusion. However, the frequent, explicit repetition of key thematic phrases like "mirage of safety" and "incomplete information" borders on thematic summary, slightly weakening the subtext by over-stating what the imagery already conveys so well.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of 'competing narratives' is masterfully integrated, emerging from character, setting, and conflict rather than authorial statement. The sedimentary layers serve as a brilliant physical metaphor for historical truth versus revisionist myth. The story avoids a tidy moral, ending on a note of defiant persistence, and the final image of the cog as a "beacon of reason" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the value of difficult truths.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central theme, that harmony requires subtracting noise, is powerfully embodied in the rosette metaphor. However, the story leans too heavily on explicit statement, particularly in Ms. Thorne’s direct explanation to the choir and in the narration ("True harmony begins in the space we clear"). This over-articulation borders on a "Thematic Echo," slightly undermining the subtext by stating what the final, resonant scene shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding beauty in ruins emerges organically from the story's particulars, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the final sentence, "She would feed the world with this truth," is a significant thematic overstatement. This explicit moralizing feels tacked-on and slightly undermines the power of the preceding quiet, specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding profound answers in overlooked details is beautifully dramatized through the riddle's transformation from artifact to diagnostic. However, the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "to remember there's wonder *in* the routine" and "the quiet magic of paying attention" function as a thematic echo, stating the moral instead of letting the resonant action carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of human care animating the inanimate is resonant and emerges organically from the plot. However, the story falters at the climax by explicitly stating its central discovery in a block of summary: "The understanding washed over her... houses felt alive because they were sanctified by the displaced objects of human care." This "Thematic Echo" undermines the subtext, explaining the moral rather than allowing the final image of the waking house to convey it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of embracing nuance over rigid certainty is expertly woven into the plot, action, and imagery, particularly the act of mending through a weakness. However, the resonance is slightly diminished by lines that state the theme too explicitly, such as the final sentence. While the core idea is strong, a touch more subtext at the very end would have made the resonant image even more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of perfection versus productive imperfection is masterfully woven through the imagery of the dice and the staircase. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about regret. However, the piece verges on stating its theme directly in lines like "perfection traps, but flaws make motion possible," which slightly undermines the subtext. This moment of explicit moralizing is the primary factor holding the score back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory and connection persisting against urban alienation is beautifully integrated through character action and imagery. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the final image of the woman's smile to provide a resonant answer. The final sentence, however, veers slightly into thematic summary ("...proving the smog could never quite extinguish the light..."), a minor flaw that slightly over-articulates what the preceding scene had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, not statement. The central thematic tension between remembrance and survival is resolved brilliantly in the final act. The repurposing of the bread baskets is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, offering a complex take on how tradition must adapt to prevent erasure. The piece lingers with a powerful sense of defiant hope against overwhelming loss.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the synthesis of character, setting, and action. The idea of tuning time rather than breaking it provides a nuanced answer to the problem of fate. The final image of branching paths serves as a resonant, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire narrative without a single word of explicit moralizing, culminating in the sublime phrase "bleak exhilaration."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of acknowledgment conquering fear is powerfully dramatized through the story's central paradoxes and climax. The final image of Fear dissolving under the "light of acknowledgment" is resonant. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this by stating the theme too explicitly: "Fear had revealed its weakness: it could not survive the light of acknowledgment." This borders on a Thematic Echo, replacing the full power of the closing image with a summary that feels unnecessary.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming obstacles into instruments is powerfully realized through action and imagery. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct statement, slightly undermining the subtext. The line "a testament to turning dread into music" borders on a thematic summary, preventing the theme from emerging purely through resonance and costing it a higher score, though the final image recovers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of confronting a vast, silent unknown emerges organically from the plot and setting without a single didactic line. The story resists a simple answer, instead focusing on the cost of seeking one. The final image of Kael choosing to walk the path provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question—that true understanding requires not just observation, but a dangerous, direct engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "noble lies" is potent and well-developed through the historical parallels. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme too directly. The rehearsed final argument ("The first lie promised peace but delivered only deeper wounds...") verges on a concluding moral, slightly undermining the resonance that the powerful imagery had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of memory and absence is potent and well-integrated into the plot, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly uses its own thematic labels—"interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams"—to explain its meaning. The line "Interlaced absence wasn’t just emptiness; it was the ghostly echo..." is a direct thematic summary that replaces subtext with assertion, constituting a significant Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of truth versus manufactured history is woven organically through the narrative. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a sophisticated resolution through the act of "recontextualizing" the forgeries rather than destroying them. The final image of her new, simple stamp is a resonant, non-literal answer to how we handle inconvenient historical truths.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme is powerfully woven through the central metaphors of origami and gem polishing. However, the story occasionally veers into direct thematic statements, such as "love and loss were the same spectrum," which slightly undermines the subtext. While the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, these moments of over-articulation prevent the theme from reaching the highest tier of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of potential preserved beyond loss is powerful and elegantly explored through the story's central conceit. The final image of mapping "stolen futures" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief. The only minor weakness is the repetition of the phrase "intangibly tangible," which verges on becoming a thematic label rather than letting the concept emerge purely from the action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of belonging as a frequency is woven through compelling imagery, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image. The piece mostly avoids moralizing, but the commander's quote ("Belonging isn’t a place... It’s a frequency") is a thematic statement that slightly reduces the subtext's power. This moment of telling, rather than showing, is the primary weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven through the narrative, emerging from the plot rather than being stated. The story explores the nature of truth and consequence, and the final image of Silas holding the watch hand offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The ending resists a tidy moral, settling on the more complex and honest ground of "tempered regret."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of salvaging wisdom from ruin emerges powerfully through the central symbol and the subtext-heavy climax. However, the story explicitly states its theme multiple times (e.g., "recycle mistakes into wisdom," "recycling his past error"), which feels like an authorial summary. This thematic echo slightly undermines the otherwise potent, image-driven conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding a new way to navigate regret emerges powerfully from the central metaphor. The final image of the gilded poles offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped by the repeated, explicit thematic statement "to align heart and action," which functions as a Thematic Echo that states the theme directly rather than letting it arise solely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of reigniting empathy emerges organically from Silas’s actions, particularly his reinterpretation of "choose the light." The climax with the girl provides a powerful, non-verbal crystallization of this theme. However, the final paragraph resorts to overt thematic summary ("kindness, like this lake, was both delicate and unbreakable"), a form of moralizing that replaces earned resonance with direct statement, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transformation through acceptance is powerfully rendered through image and action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's grief. However, the score is capped by the story's tendency to state its theme directly, particularly the line "...the reluctant metamorphosis within her finally complete," which functions as a thematic summary that slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of mending absence with presence is explored with nuance and powerful imagery, particularly the final image of the joined hands. The story largely trusts its subtext. However, the line "Cloudbound repentance wasn’t about erasing absence but embracing presence" slips into direct thematic statement, a minor authorial intrusion in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of healing through acceptance is powerfully integrated into every element, from character to setting. The story resists a simple moral, offering a nuanced take on pacifism and grief. The final image of the pacified ship provides resonant closure, but the concluding phrase—"mended the unbroken"—is a slight misstep, a thematic statement that verges on summarizing the story's meaning rather than letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transformation through generosity is central, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The story frequently articulates its own meaning directly, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary ("transformation was a dance of small, luminous steps..."). This over-explanation, a form of Thematic Echo, diminishes the resonance that the story's powerful imagery works so hard to build.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of a "silent revolution" is elegantly woven through the story's core mechanics—a scholar's quill, a forgotten sundial, a signal of light, not noise. The concept is explored through action rather than statement. The final line, "The revolution wouldn’t roar; it would whisper, then blaze," is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's driving question, offering a powerful thematic conclusion without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of yielding to mysterious forces rather than controlling them emerges organically from the plot. The final image powerfully resonates with this idea. However, the final paragraph contains several lines that state the theme too directly ("Understanding wasn't a destination; it was the act of seeking itself"), which borders on a thematic echo and slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of scars as "waypoints, not wounds" emerges organically from the story's central metaphor. The final image of the hand as a "luminous map" is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the explicit, spoken line "We are the constellations we survive" acts as a thematic summary, slightly diminishing the power of the preceding imagery by stating the moral directly. This thematic echo in the final paragraph is the category's primary flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of seeking clarity through logic over force is well-integrated into the central conflict. However, the resonance is weakened by overly explicit statements at the end. The final lines about the "brook's song" and "questions finally arriving home" feel like a thematic summary, verging on a stated moral where a resonant image would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic integration is superb, with the core idea of forging "beauty from anarchy" woven into every detail, from the prison library backstory to the rusted setting. The final image of scattering blank papers is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, suggesting hope is about creating space for new voices, not just repeating old ones. It's a deeply resonant and earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through the story’s core elements, emerging from the interplay of music, memory, and physics without a single line of exposition. The final image of a figure coalescing from music provides a profound, non-literal answer to the story’s central conflict. This resolution is thematically resonant, emotionally honest, and avoids any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story's central theme of balancing empiricism and whimsy is woven into every element. The concept of "luminous doubt" is a powerful and resonant anchor for the theme. The piece is slightly marred by a moment of thematic overstatement in the line, "truth here was both measured and magical," which articulates the theme directly rather than allowing it to remain fully emergent from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme is explored with remarkable subtlety and depth, resisting a simple resolution. The story's central insight—that apology is a continuous action, "the daily tending of wounds"—is earned through concrete imagery rather than abstract statement. The final action of weaving new stitches into the shawl provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem, perfectly fulfilling the demands for a high-level thematic conclusion that reweights all prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of finding navigable ground in silence amid prophesied darkness emerges organically from images like pooled silences and the booklet's fragments, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the void as profound landscape; subtext in gestures like pressing ear to stone invites reflection on preservation versus acceptance. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy morals, though some direct statements like "silence was not the end" border on assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of thoughts emerging from accumulated experiences integrates with the core concept via specific loop syntheses, emerging organically without direct statements, and invites reflection through ambiguity in the mundane mysticism. The final image of the refreezing violin offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the origin question, reweighting repetition as renewal. Subtext in the violin's melting and freezing avoids tidy morals, but occasional abstract assertions like "profound revelation" border on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of honesty freeing mistrust emerges organically from particulars like doodles capturing unspoken tensions and Elara's gesture, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights silence as trust without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implications, like adjusting the strap, invites reflection on transparency's complexity.
