  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between neutron star decay and greenhouse dissolution, with the butterfly dust serving as a concrete vehicle for exploring control versus acceptance. The final image of Elena clearing decay "with acceptance" offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though phrases like "kindled humility" occasionally state rather than embody the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "charcoal's black into luminous wonder"—darkness becoming light through artistic alchemy. The recurring motif of fragmentation/reconstruction (shattered glass artist, scorched testament, frost patterns) builds toward the final realization without explicit moralizing. The ending reweights the smuggling legacy as artistic resilience rather than criminal shame.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of translating emotion into music, with the heat-mapping serving as literal and metaphorical bridge. The "unshaken marvels" that bloom despite silence create resonant subtext about resilience. The ending achieves thematic unity as personal loss transforms into collective restoration without explicit moralizing, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of unrest into rest, with the library's dual nature as tomb/repository embodying the central question. The final image of "unchased peace" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's "chased stillness." Specific ghosts (scholar, lover) avoid abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the bell's resonance, midnight runs, and the arbor as witness—all concrete particulars that accumulate meaning. The final image of "parcels...not anonymous now, but declared gifts from all to all" offers a non-literal answer about community resilience. The piece avoids moralizing, though "intergenerational support" occasionally reads as thesis-like rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of reclaiming lost love emerges through the camera obscura's inverted projections and Kwan Yin's tear, creating resonance between compassion and healing. However, the resolution arrives through abstract realization ("to heal, she must release it") rather than dramatized particulars, and the ending states rather than embodies its wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of time's texture emerges through concrete discovery ("not smooth like silk, but rough and knotted, like bark etched by countless seasons") and the trade-off between knowledge and loss. The fading photographs motif reinforces temporal decay throughout. However, Elias's final smile and readiness to design new mazes slightly undercuts the weight of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of "resilience in dry soil" emerges through the seed vault's promise versus the barren lands, with Elias embodying patient defiance. The arrow's DNA helix fletching subtly suggests directed growth. The ending's vision of "green shoots piercing arid earth" offers non-literal answer to survival through preservation, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of healing through confronting absence emerges organically from "collecting absences" to forge understanding, with the final line "from absences, new trusts might bloom" offering resonant closure. The concept avoids explicit moralizing while exploring how loss shapes creation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between capturing vs. creating "illuminated moments," with the moonbeam jar literalizing this metaphor effectively. The floral cipher parallel between Elara's methods and the portrait's hidden code creates resonance. The ending reweights theft as hollow compared to creation without stating this moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thawing metaphor elegantly bridges external ice melt with internal emotional release, avoiding explicit moralizing. The glass spheres as "safe zones for inquiry" offer a non-literal answer to processing grief, and the bookmark transformation from marking "enduring winters" to being sealed in glass reweights its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength emerges through concrete action, particularly in the climax where phobias become tactical advantages. However, the story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("vulnerability is power"), reducing subtextual resonance. The seashell's whispers and the childhood cast create some symbolic layering, but the final paragraph's direct moralizing ("vulnerability, admitted and adapted to with trembling certainty, was indeed power") undermines earned thematic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of mapping absence and preserving silence in "ambered hush." The final image of the sealed booklet holding legacy "against the endless night" resonates without stating a moral. The concept of summarizing silence between events creates meaningful complexity about preservation and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of playing music that amalgamates fragmented experiences into wholeness. The final realization that "thoughts originated in the amalgamation of experiences, born from loops that made the ordinary profound" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The mundane mysticism of sweeping-to-enlightenment avoids abstraction through specific loop memories.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concert tickets' "cryptic doodles" as confession method and the projector lens making truth "ambiguously clear." The final image of crystals reflecting "a world where transparency bridged the gaps mistrust had carved" resonates without moralizing. The core concept of being "freed by honesty" shapes both action and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between measurable luck and unmeasurable care, with the marbles serving as concrete symbols of mended deception. The final image of Elias surrounded by loyal vines offers a non-literal answer to whether true skill transcends fortune. Minor deduction for the slightly didactic declaration "This garden knows its gardener."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of sideways time versus linear progression emerges through the experiment and creature observations, avoiding explicit moralizing. The ending's return to normalcy ("synth-coffee to celebrate") suggests acceptance of mystery over dangerous knowledge. However, thematic resonance remains somewhat abstract—the "sideways mysteries" don't deeply interrogate human experience or values beyond scientific curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the "in-between spaces" concept—pauses in music where spirits dwell, unstruck chords holding secrets, the gap between "life and echo." The water damage as revelation method literalizes transformation through ruin. The ending's return to "unstruck chords once again" reweights the opening silence with new meaning, though some passages lean toward explicit thematic statement ("the ghost's code, veiled in the program's antiquity, now revealed through the method of ruin").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.3)
    The weight metaphor for swallowed truth resonates but resolves into explicit theme statement: "its weight finally quantifiable—not in pounds or grams, but in the auroral sorrow." The botanical illustration's dual nature offers complexity, yet the ending's "lighter now" provides tidy resolution without earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges through the parallel between factory workers' eternal toil and Alex's carried burden of denial. The radio calls provide an elegant metaphorical layer about swallowed truths. However, the final insight about his father's "deliberate escape" arrives through internal realization rather than dramatized discovery, weakening the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the keeper's neutral observation and the regenerative silence that "mended fractures of the soul." The discovery of distant civilizations creating origami swans provides thematic resonance without explicit moralizing. The final image of the "endless, impartial dance" offers a non-literal answer to questions of permanence and change. Subtext operates through the cost of eternal watching embedded in "crumbling peace."

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through the eclipse-as-metaphor and the baby hair curl as tangible memory, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of seeds planted in souls resonates without stating a thesis. However, the theme tends toward the sentimental—grief and wonder resolve too neatly without embracing genuine complexity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of walls absorbing stories and the concept of dreams leaking into reality. The displaced axis works as both plot device and thematic exploration of imagination's necessity. The ending's "stirrings of something akin to hope" offers a resonant answer without moralizing, though it edges toward the sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of transformation ("transpose life into a new key") emerges organically through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of fortunes as "deliberate symphonies of change" resonates without moralizing. Strong integration of the "open secrets" concept throughout. Minor deduction for the slightly neat resolution where transformation lacks visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the central reversal: "silence was weakness, not strength" becomes inverted through dramatized action. The rhetorical loops "Why do we assume, assume, assume?" probe this question without stating morals. The final image of "muffled dawn of revelation" resonantly reweights all prior silence-decoration as active rather than passive.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the nautilus spiral as a physical manifestation of time's recursion, with the mirrored horizon literalizing the convergence of past and future without stating it. The final fortune "In spirals of memory, conduct the dawn" resonates as earned wisdom from his specific journey, while the concept of becoming conductor of "unheard symphonies" reweights his fortune-writing gift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of confronting one's foundational trauma emerges through the recursive exploration structure, culminating in the revelation of childhood fear as the source. The final grounding literalizes liberation from cyclical patterns. The light/dark imagery effectively tracks thematic progression, though some timeline variations feel schematic rather than emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of silence creating connection and reversed music healing forward—the "profound music of quietude" resonates without stating a moral. The final image of hearts touched by silence reweights the opening isolation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between isolation and connection, truth and corruption. The final image of Elias whispering to the departing pigeon while maintaining his solitary path offers a resonant, non-literal answer about integrity's price. The layered tranquility motif effectively reweights from surface calm to chosen isolation despite external chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between extinct plants' resurrection and emotional revival, with the mother's inscription providing resonant wisdom without moralizing. The final image of Elias pocketing the vial "ready to broker lanterns infused with this newfound peace" reweights his profession through earned understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    The rope motif effectively bridges past escape and present bind, gaining resonance when Elias "coiled the rope around his wrist" in his final non-choice. The theme of impossible choices between freedom and entrapment emerges through concrete action rather than statement, though the energy beings' philosophical dilemma feels more asserted than dramatized until the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of finding beauty in incompletion emerges organically through concrete images - half-formed fruits, unfinished melodies, trails that fade to silence. The final image of "a world reborn in whispers, elegant in its eternal incompletion" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the mendicant's bowl as vessel for lost stories.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of authenticity versus deception emerges organically through Elara's transformation of "counterfeit emotions into authentic ones." The final image of the grotto as "a cherished memory, warmly regarded yet ready to be released" offers a resonant answer about letting go of past identities. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, allowing the transformation itself to embody the thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" emerges clearly through parallel stories (Elias's past rescue, the grandfather's anonymous contributions, Lira's volunteer work) and culminates in their commitment to continue this pattern. However, the theme announcement feels explicit, particularly with direct statements about "cycles of compassion" and "silent contributors." The ending image of "an enduring tapestry of quiet kindness" verges on stated moral rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of connection through shared endeavor emerges through the search ritual and arbor creation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the arbor as beacon for future grafting offers resonance, though the "cycle of ache and luminescence" leans toward abstraction rather than earned complexity from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation requiring disruption—Elara must free the caged source to maintain stasis. The infinity symbol and borrowed time create thematic resonance about cycles and creative sacrifice, though the final image could more powerfully reweight earlier material without the explanatory "forever changed" summary.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between mathematical certainty and emotional ambiguity, culminating in "possibility, of loss that was not absolute." The taxidermist eyes breathing "false life" resonates with the uncertain nature of the vision. Slight deduction for the explicit statement about "mathematics of emotion" that could trust the imagery more.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of chosen visibility versus protective isolation emerges through Elias's actions rather than statement. The tape fragment becomes a physical manifestation of preserved hope ("forbidden lecture on hope amid darkness") that transfers its resonance to the young woman. The final image of Elias retreating to "cache his presence until the next soul wandered into the shadows" offers a non-literal answer about the cyclical nature of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of adaptation through surrender emerges organically from Elara's transformation: "to reconstruct herself...she had to do it by releasing control." The metaphor of plants adapting to storms mirrors human resilience without heavy-handed moralizing. The ending image of Elara as living testament to "metamorphosis embraced" resonates, though some thematic statements like "beauty in yielding" edge toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "convergence"—personal and historical traumas intersecting at this excavated point. The final image of painting "the brooch's glow amid converging storms" resonates without stating a moral. The threshing metaphor works throughout. Some thematic articulation ("to thresh meaning not in isolation, but through connection") edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the tension between rigid foresight and "steadily unpredictable" magic, suggesting true power lies in embracing uncertainty. The oxymoronic "bright darkness" and "overlapping shadows" work as concrete images that embody this paradox. The ending offers a non-literal answer: Elara will magnify wonder through unpredictable lens rather than controlled vision, though some thematic statements ("true magic lay in the unknown") edge toward directness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of reconstructing identity from fragments emerges organically through the ocean-spray archiving concept and the herald's valve symbolism. The story avoids explicit moralizing, letting the image of the valve passing among exiles carry thematic weight. The final image of people "no longer adrift but anchored" resonates with the compilation theme, though the resolution feels slightly neat given the scale of trauma described.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of confronting buried truths emerges organically through the journey metaphor, with the phantom train and fortress serving as effective symbols. The recurring "analytically artistic" mindset creates thematic coherence. However, the ending states its moral too directly ("bad habits shatter, replaced by new starts") rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between skepticism and belief, crystallizing when "kindness [becomes] her truest guide." The magic square tile transcends mathematical curiosity to become a bridge between worlds. The final shift from skepticism to wonder resonates without moralizing. The recurring whale migration and unheard symphony effectively charge the ending's peaceful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of seeking meaning beyond endings emerges through the concrete pursuit of "after-goodbye," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "hushed echoes of what lay beyond" offers resonance without stating conclusions. However, the exploration remains somewhat abstract—the glimpsed realm of "infinite possibilities" lacks the specificity that would elevate thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of fair exchange emerges through Alex's mathematical approach to balancing moral debts, avoiding simple moralizing. The ink pot serves as both literal tool and metaphor for dissolving rigid boundaries. Final image of "scales finally even" resonates without stating explicit moral, though some thematic articulation feels overly explicit ("mathematics of a fair trade").

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of preserving what the world forgets emerges organically through Elias's practice of creating "invented histories" from temporal textures. The concept of time being "refracted, bent like light through a prism" provides rich metaphorical grounding. The final realization about deliberate silence containing power resonates but would benefit from more concrete dramatization of what this means for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of erased histories emerges organically through collected fragments and the survivor's own bureaucratic erasure. The poison bottle as both cause and talisman creates effective thematic resonance. The final image of "nameless yet textured" existence offers a non-literal answer to questions of identity and official memory.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ephemeral/permanent dichotomy emerges through concrete images - the fading seashell compass, closing logbook pages, and half-finished cello. The theme avoids explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "life's riddle was to navigate its transience with resilient joy," which slightly undercuts the otherwise elegant accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of community resistance versus privatization emerges through the graffiti campaign and cooperative guilds. The foundation stone chip carries symbolic weight as unity's anchor. However, the resolution tends toward wishful thinking—"foundations could be rebuilt" feels unearned given the power differential between rafters and corporations that the story establishes but doesn't truly confront.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between space age progress and vanishing quiet moments. The dawning hush concept integrates naturally without exposition. The final image of digital preservation against irreversible loss offers resonant commentary on what technology can and cannot save.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "decoding chaos into direction" emerges organically through Elias's blindness and repair method, with the water refraction serving as both literal tool and metaphor. The ending image of Elias returning to stillness while enabling motion resonates, though it risks tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of origins and convergence emerges through concrete imagery (condensation patterns mirroring river flows) rather than statements. However, without reaching the actual convergence or paying cost for the quest, thematic resonance remains incomplete. The story gestures toward meaning about discovery and risk but doesn't land its thematic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of collective harmony versus individual discord emerges through action, particularly in the bell tower's transformation from clash to chime. However, the resolution feels neat—balance returns without exploring what caused the original fracture or what maintaining it might cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of capturing transience emerges organically through the perfume vial's power to "touch memories" and the temple's accumulated "gathered hush." The final image of Elara embracing "solitary triumph" while facing death resonates without moralizing, though the concept of "ephemeral" occasionally tips toward abstraction rather than embodied meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete exploration of inherited sin and the possibility of redemption through truth-telling. The confessional lattice works as both literal object and thematic vehicle, while the ghosts embody the weight of unspoken truths. The final image of Elias rowing away with "impossible calm sustained within" offers a resonant answer about peace earned through confronting family legacy, though it edges toward explicit statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of debt and sacrifice across lifetimes emerges through concrete actions—each ghostly visit both heals and harms, embodying the "mournful elation" of love's cost. The final image of "a beacon in the thawing hush" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward explicit theme ("debts unpaid across lifetimes").

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "broken precedents" and communal healing emerges through the overlapping paths and collaborative unconscious work. However, the theme develops through description rather than dramatized struggle—"breaking the precedent of isolation" is stated rather than shown through conscious choice. The final image of the transformed labyrinth resonates but lacks the weight of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of interrupted journeys and restoration emerges through repetition but resolves into tidy completion without complexity. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("faith blooming like the trees amid the bones") rather than letting it emerge from the final image. The sundial metaphor is transparent allegory without surprising resonance. Missing counter-readings or genuine ambiguity that would create lasting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in margins emerges through the chalk codes and pseudonym creation, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level, with concepts like "bridging eras" stated rather than complicated through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of wisdom disguised as foolishness and the power of "unheard stories" to expose truth. The embroidered chart as both art and warning system offers resonant subtext. The ending's choice to remain hidden while enabling future discovery avoids tidy resolution, though the thematic weight could deepen through more specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "unsent letters" and "the space where an apology waits unspoken." The final image of stepping out "ready to decide anew" offers a non-literal answer about choosing vulnerability over protective isolation. Subtext operates through the condensation messages and singing spirits without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the coral's "labyrinthine grooves" mirroring tangled minds and the discovered poem about wounds becoming flowers. The "lotus-hearted ache" creates emotional resonance without explicit moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose connection between physical and emotional wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of recovering/sharing joy emerges through concrete actions (unearthing, pressing fragment to earth, painting with light) rather than statements. The final image of carrying "the orchard's pensive mirth into her art" offers resonant answer without moralizing. The exposed film metaphor deepens throughout—from fragment as negative to full projection—earning its thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the garden's architecture where "certainties dissolved into questions," with the hobo nickel as talisman of transformation. The nested structure itself embodies the theme of trading solid ground for "thrilling vertigo of wonder." The ending line "I believe in the magic that questions create" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire journey.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of resistance through coded communication emerges through concrete actions—the secret language club, garden patterns, and the rattle's disruptive power. The final image of "planting not just a seed, but a revolution" resonates without stating a moral. However, some thematic elements feel declared ("thoughts became taxable") rather than arising from character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transforming pain into beauty emerges through the central metaphor of photosynthesis and blooming verses, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the concept remains abstractly poetic rather than grounded in specific embodied experience, and the final reunion doesn't genuinely reweight or complicate the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of extinct feelings and forgotten names, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara resuming her rounds with "renewed resolve" despite lingering regret offers a non-literal answer about persistence amid loss. The glass orchids and preserved names create resonant particulars rather than abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of truth versus silence emerges organically through Elara's protective silence being misunderstood as abandonment, with the symphonies literally "unsnarling" misunderstanding into harmony. The final image of "hearts aligned" before "separate futures" resonates without moralizing, though the resolution's tidiness slightly undercuts complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "encrypted compassion" emerges organically through Mira's hidden message and Elias's engineering solution, avoiding explicit moralizing. The surveyor's chain as symbol of "measured mercy" resonates well. Yet the theme resolves too neatly—both sides get what they want without genuine trade-offs, undermining complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.3)
    The bloom/wither motif threads throughout and pays off in "tears bloomed... withering fear giving way." Theme emerges from concrete actions—mapping chaos into order mirrors internal rebalancing. However, the final insight about "sharing" versus "hiding" reads as stated moral rather than earned resonance. The piece tells its meaning too directly in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    The butterfly effect theme and sacred thresholds concept emerge through accumulated details but resolve into abstract insight ("sacredness arose from the hush before crossing") rather than earned revelation through struggle. The final paragraph states the theme explicitly rather than letting it resonate through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of belonging emerges through concrete action—rigging the observatory, navigating ruins, performing the ritual. The "rhythm of belonging" isn't just stated but enacted through synchronized breathing with guardians. Final image of being "forever attuned" reweights the opening isolation without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of missing pieces and vanished paths emerges through the seed examination, but resolves into explicit moralizing: "paths disappear not from malice, but from the natural drift of time and choice." The final paragraph states the theme directly rather than allowing it to resonate through image and action, diminishing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of ordering randomness into art emerges through action rather than statement, with the bishop serving as a symbol of "diagonal precision in a world of straight lines." However, the thematic resolution feels neat—the crowd disperses "carrying whispers of magical happenstance" without exploring the complexity of manufactured versus authentic wonder. The story doesn't interrogate whether Elias's manipulation diminishes the gift.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of memory as resistance emerges through concrete action—Elara literally inscribes forbidden knowledge onto her flesh. The gaps between stars mirror the hollows carved by the nostalgia ban, creating resonant parallel. The final image of mortals feeling "cosmic verse stirring in their own hidden depths" offers a non-literal answer about how memory persists despite suppression.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding value in the mundane emerges organically through glass-crafting and ripple-reading imagery. The prism atrium splitting light into rainbows serves as effective metaphor without feeling forced. However, phrases like "noctilucent reckonings" and explicit statements about "value in the mundane" edge toward theme-stating rather than pure emergence through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of transforming pain into connection emerges organically through the porcelain box metaphor and the parallel between physical and emotional scars. The "cracks" motif effectively links Eli's scars, the box, and the stellar patterns overhead. However, Eli's explicit philosophizing ("Pain isn't just destruction...It's a teacher") and the final paragraph's summary ("having translated agony into empathy") undercut the subtlety, stating what the imagery already conveyed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hope as mathematical equation emerges through concrete decorative patterns, avoiding direct moralizing. The trial balloon concept literalizes experimentation effectively. However, the thematic resolution lacks complexity—hope is simply restored without examining what was lost or why it failed initially.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of inherited burden and shared narrative emerges organically through Silas's parallel struggle with "the legacy of denial that accelerated the world's unraveling." The walls' dreams metaphor works as accumulated regrets rather than fantasies, though the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("a shared narrative to rewrite") edges toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of possibilities versus fixed reality emerges through the painter's actions rather than statement. The coded lullabies and borrowed heartbeat create resonant motifs. However, the thematic question resolves too neatly—the mirrors simply comply without exploring the cost of infinite possibilities or why fixed reality might have value.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of redemption through sacrifice emerges from events, and the "flawed beauty" of imperfect peace resonates in the ending image. But the piece explicitly states its themes ("price of redemption," "flawed but beautiful peace") rather than letting them arise from particulars, and the final paragraph borders on moralizing with "turning ideals into reality."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between destruction and preservation, with the extinct bird's echo serving as a non-literal answer to questions of legacy and redemption. The final image of "stormy absolution" resonates without moralizing, reweighting his earlier "amoral philanthropy." Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "fractured grace" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the harvest of ancestral voices representing suppressed truths, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of snow swirling in response to liberated echoes offers a non-literal answer to the conformity question. The concept of "echoes" as trapped ancestral wisdom effectively links action to meaning, though some phrasing ("complacent slumber") edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between deceptive calligraphy and subversive truth-telling puppetry, with the story stick bridging both worlds. The ending's image of Elias planning "scripts that challenged power structures" offers a non-literal answer to the ethical storytelling question, though some thematic statements feel overly explicit ("could subversion heal the wounds of deceit").

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the moth wing's "interrupted cadence" paralleling the monarch's solitary flight, both "unresolved melodies." The final realization that "some harmonies resolve only in silence" reweights the entire piece without moralizing, though "esoteric realist" and "overlooked histories" occasionally veer toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the preservation of forgotten names - a concrete manifestation of memory and heritage. The final image of names echoing "against the melt of time" offers resonant non-literal answer to loss without moralizing, though "transcribed memory" occasionally surfaces too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the decay/rebirth motif, from "decaying directives like fallen leaves" to souls "freeing space for new growth." The final image of rain washing away remnants while Elara walks chosen paths offers resonant answer without stated moral, successfully avoiding the thematic echo trap.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of bridging empirical science with mystical forces emerges through Elias's actions and the "empirically ironic" magic square. The irony of a scientist turning to enchantment resonates, and the spectral sages suggest continuity across eras. However, the ending lacks complexity—Elias achieves his goal without confronting the contradiction between his scientific devotion and mystical pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of releasing resentment emerges through concrete action (the pin unlocking body memories) rather than statement. The broken music box pin carries layered meaning—Elara's past hurt transformed into healing tool. Subtext operates through gesture and the sanctuary's transformative properties. The final image of Elara pocketing the pin for the next soul resonantly answers the central question about how change occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of bridging divided realms emerges through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in how "broken things could reflect hidden truths." The final image of the orchard "less lost, its fog a guardian rather than a shroud" offers a non-literal answer about transformation through acceptance. The recurring glass/mirror motif accumulates meaning, culminating in Elias standing "amid the glass mountains of his making."

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    The deciduous vows concept elegantly frames grief as seasonal renewal rather than permanent loss, emerging through concrete details rather than exposition. The notebook's poems about "embracing change" and "vows that leaf out anew" provide thematic resonance, while the quartz-infused ribbon symbolizes mended promises. However, the wisdom transfer feels slightly mechanical—Lila's immediate comprehension ("Accidents, my dear, are wisdom's favorite disguise") arrives without sufficient struggle to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the nonlinear inheritance concept—knowledge flowing "backward and forward" through time. The final image of Elias chasing "truths that danced just beyond the last page" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. The orchard's eternal blooming "between pages unturned" effectively metaphorizes the cost of forbidden wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    The "unheard symphony" metaphor threads throughout, creating thematic coherence around hidden knowledge and unspoken harmonies. The Library of Unlearned Lessons offers conceptual resonance about mistakes not yet made. However, the theme resolves too neatly with both characters achieving their goals, and the final line about "music of possibilities" feels like explicit thematic summary rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the chimeric identity exploration without explicit moralizing. The final garden image offers a non-literal answer about unity within aberrance. Strong subtext operates through the carnival's "abandoned joys mirroring her inner fragmentation." Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("unkindled solace") that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the concrete action of recovering lost histories, with the seal and fables creating a resonant exploration of absence and presence. The ending offers a non-literal answer about bridging voids. However, phrases like "turned complexity into clear, enduring legacy" edge toward explicit moralizing rather than letting the image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "hammered repose"—peace forged through endurance rather than found in absence—paid off when the bloom proves "no delicate flower" but something "forged in the examination of ice." The ripple-mark maps mirror the spreading bloom, creating resonance without stating morals. The final image of "forged armor, ready for whatever storms might come" reweights the opening chaos as necessary tempering rather than pure disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through action - the "coincidental" child's discovery, stars aligning, and Elara's timely find all prove her thesis about meaning. The shard of hush literally and thematically brings order to chaos. The final image of distant survivors approaching like "moths to flame" resonates without moralizing. Some thematic articulation feels slightly on-the-nose ("coincidences were illusions").

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of identity emerging from collective memory develops through concrete images (shadow measurements revealing distortions, monuments as repositories). The piece avoids direct moralizing, letting the metaphor of solid fog as isolation work implicitly. The ending's claim that "identities emerged, sculpted from experience, ready to defy the hush" gestures toward resonance but doesn't quite earn it through the preceding dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of defying despair through creative action emerges from concrete events rather than statement, particularly through the fire-spinning that literally illuminates hidden meaning. The mosaic's message risks explicit moralizing but earns partial reprieve through integration with action. Final image of Elias ready to "illuminate the world once more" resonates without full abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the tidal metaphor—"Transitions are like tides; they pull back to reveal what's enduring." The jade cicada's rebirth symbolism avoids heavy-handedness, though passages like "time revealed its texture—not as a linear thread, but as a woven tapestry" edge toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The silence-collection concept creates an original thematic framework linking confinement to expansion through paradox (finding vastness in quietude). The final image of walls becoming "a canvas for skyward dreams" resonates thematically. However, the transformation feels conceptually tidy rather than emotionally complex, and the theme states itself too directly in places.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the storm glass metaphor: internal storms versus clarity in stillness, without explicit moralizing. The final image of "dawn's light fractured through the prisms" while "the vaulting hush reigning supreme" offers a non-literal answer about finding peace through acceptance rather than flight.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of weaving past and future emerges through world details and Elara's quest, with "futuristic nostalgia" effectively rendered through bio-luminescent trees and circuit-embedded vines. However, the resolution's meaning remains vague—what does "renewed harmony" actually mean for Neo-Elysium? The story gestures toward complexity but doesn't earn its philosophical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of burning bridges to grant breath - isolation as compassion. The shadow-keeping metaphor accumulates meaning, and the final image of "guardians of lessons learned" resonates without stating a moral. The scar-linking method creates thematic depth about permanent connection despite severance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transforming trauma into value emerges organically through concrete action rather than statement, with the final image of shared diamonds resonating as collective healing. The "translate pressure into diamonds" motif works both literally and metaphorically, though the resolution feels slightly too neat in how completely the scheme's damage is reversed.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "eloquently silent" artifacts speaking through vibrations, with the bridge of intuition effectively dramatized as Elias pieces together fragments. The final image of walking into night "forever changed by golden shadows of revelation" resonates without stating a moral. The standing waves as method for revealing hidden truth creates a strong metaphor for how silence can speak.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marionette/puppeteer motif effectively bridges isolation and connection—Elandor moves from withdrawn solitude to being bound by "infinite threads." The final image of him as guardian "connected to infinite threads" resonantly answers his search for possibility, though the theme could deepen if the cost of this binding were more ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel stories of fracture and kindness across time. The button serves as a concrete object carrying thematic weight about fighting "for kindness" rather than just freedom. The resonance between historical and personal loss avoids heavy-handedness, though "magnifying small kindnesses" occasionally veers toward explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete action: the tyranny of indifference manifests in collective shrugs and revised histories, while resistance persists through resourceful preservation of truth. The phone booth key transforms from obsolete relic to vital tool, and the lagoon shifts from toxic waste site (revised history) to communication hub (truth). The ending resonates without stating a moral as the seed of resistance takes root despite regime efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the concept of negative space—absence as power, silence as action. The final image of "guardian woven from absence and memory" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. The piece explores how voids and pauses can hold more power than presence, though some thematic statements like "vested hush" occasionally feel overly explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of "building tiny monuments to forgotten things"—honoring the overlooked enables transformation. The ending reweights this when the spirit thanks her "for the monuments that remembered what others forgot." However, the theme risks tidiness; complexity would deepen if remembering carried darker cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between Elias's rigid planning and the patterns that "whispered of deeper mysteries." The compass rose functions as both literal tool and thematic symbol of "adapting to chaos." The final image of clocks incorporating uncertainty "turning broken time into harmonious flow" resonates without explicit moralizing, though some phrasing ("befriend uncertainty") edges toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kintsugi theme emerges organically through action—"repairing the broken with golden seams that honored the scars"—rather than declaration. The weight of names develops from Aurora's creation through dissolution to redemption, with names as "gravitational constants" that can "bind or break." The final image of equilibrium "gilded and whole" resonates with the kintsugi philosophy, though some passages like "transforming ruin into something more profound" edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of healing through joy emerges organically from the dramatized ritual, avoiding explicit moralizing. "Luminous ache" perfectly captures the story's core paradox - beauty laced with sorrow. The final image of Elara's "modest triumph" knowing "one more wanderer had found peace through joy's gentle pursuit" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    The mercy-as-mathematics concept offers conceptual ambition, and the pewter strap transforms from "shackle" to "variable in the equation." However, the theme announces itself too directly through Elara's explicit formulation, and the mathematical metaphor feels imposed rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The ending's assertion that she'll "share the formula with a world that needed it" reads as unearned thematic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of making forgotten histories visible, avoiding direct moralizing. The lighthouse lens serves as a recurring motif that charges the final image when it becomes "a bridge rather than a barrier." However, the thematic resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "ceilings hide" secrets/spirits, with the horologist's enchantment representing artificial preservation versus natural endings. The "cracks in the façade" motif links physical deterioration to spiritual imprisonment effectively. The final image of ghosts ascending "through the ceiling cracks" resonates without stating a moral, though the "fragile threads of forgotten lives" edges toward explicit summary.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the tension between perfection and necessary rupture, with the bottled whisper's "rustling awakenings" literalizing dormant truths stirring to life. The final image—Elias continuing his cryptic printing with eternity compressed within him—offers a non-literal answer about accepting imperfection as the price of reclaiming what matters.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of hidden tyranny beneath opulent facades emerges organically through the baroque setting and crystal shard discovery. The parallel between Elias's failed revolution and the ancient civilization's "quiet uprisings drowned in opulence" creates meaningful resonance. The ending offers a non-literal answer about redemption through reinterpretation, though it edges toward explicit thematic statement in places.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through the covenant's transformation from rust to renewal and the mending of invisible fractures through harmony rather than force. The ferns serve as a recurring motif tied to truth/dishonesty. However, the ending veers toward explicit moralizing with "testament to mending the unseen" and lacks complexity—midnight is purely antagonistic without nuance, and the restoration comes without meaningful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the search for "where explanations fail" - realized in the lagoon that "defied science." The petrichor motif transforms from storm-scent to "earth's own tears," and the factory closure enables spiritual opening. Final image of Elara carrying the secret "quiet resonance" effectively reweights the opening without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of bridging past and present through art emerges organically through Elara's sculptural response to the visions. The "timewoven alliances" concept gains depth through layered historical references.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the night-blooming flower metaphor, effectively layering personal grief, family legacy, and artistic expression. The final revelation about "umbral tenderness" and beauty needing "no audience" resonates without explicit moralizing. The recurring imagery gains meaning through accumulation rather than forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the tension between solidarity and survival, with the obsidian lagoon reflecting "distorted memories" of betrayal. The debris-message parley literalizes the fragmentary nature of historical truth.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of authentic renewal versus illusory comfort emerges organically through Elias's choices and the town's history. The amber bottle serves as an effective metaphor for trapped illusions.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and transformation—Elias seeks to archive stasis but accidentally catalyzes change. The wax cylinder motif effectively links past curiosity to present purpose, and the final image of the skyscraper wrapped in "velvet embrace of uneasy transformation" resonates. However, the accidental nature of the prophecy undermines thematic coherence, making the wisdom feel unearned rather than arising from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of inherited time and generational legacy emerges through concrete particulars—the seed-saving profession paralleling temporal preservation, the vortex as literal inherited portal. The texture of "borrowed time" materializes in the visions ("smooth as polished stone, others jagged like thorns"). Final image of "seeds of time to plant" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the listening/noise dichotomy, with the final image of Elias coiling the rope affirming that "true warnings came not from ropes or sirens." The concept avoids moralizing while exploring how genuine understanding requires patient attention over reactive clamor.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength emerges organically through Elara's observation of falling stars that "could have shattered but instead adapted, finding grace in descent." The yellow lantern glass effectively refracts this theme through physical action. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thematic conclusion ("growth born from serene surrender") rather than letting the image alone carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of preservation (bees/honey), communication (mute eloquence), and loss (the wasteland), with the stained glass box serving as a perfect vessel for unspoken words.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through the drake's partial healing and Elias's artistic philosophy.

Subtext operates effectively through the parallel between incomplete poems and incomplete healing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of interspecies harmony emerges through concrete details like copper spirals mimicking stone veins and the final revelation of ancient symbiosis. However, the ending slides into summary ("knowing that even after his passing, the temple would stand as a testament") rather than letting the image carry meaning. The concept lands but lacks resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the chemistry metaphor - homecoming as molecular bonds, the fly amber revealing neurotransmitter parallels.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of renewal after war, with the "submerged concord" concept effectively dramatized rather than stated. The dead languages and bird calls create meaningful subtext about lost knowledge being recovered. The final image of the sea "honoring the ancient pact" resonates without moralizing, though it edges toward the overtly symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "tinted revelations"—truth filtered through desperate biases—emerges organically through the waxed leaf, coded cylinder messages, and the riddle's warning about closeness distorting perception. The story resists simple resolution, questioning whether hope justifies pursuing potentially false leads. However, the thematic exploration could push deeper into the cost of choosing illusion over emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the true north concept and family tradition, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the pariah's blessing becoming strength resonates without stating the theme. Strong integration of isolation/connection paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through action—playful reverence defeating corruption, wonder thawing isolation. The chess pieces containing "secrets" and "counter-secrets" literalizes hidden knowledge nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of recording overlooked humanity emerges through concrete images: the pawnless chessboard, small gestures during interregnum, and the final illusory pawns "symbols of the small, the overlooked."

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of confronting painful truth versus comfortable illusion emerges organically through Elara's journey from substitution to revelation. The lost language stone and buried talents work as effective metaphors for suppressed potential and collective trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of self-forgiveness emerges through concrete actions (decoding threads, fidgeting with labyrinth) rather than statement, with the labyrinth's transformation from maze to "clear exit" providing non-literal resonance. The chess mistake becomes a "lesson etched in platinum" rather than a chain. Slight deduction for moments of thematic directness ("to forgive himself") though mostly earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the refraction metaphor—breaking singular guilt into "prisms of possibility." The final line "One truth becomes legions, and I am free" resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of nostalgia as imprisonment emerges through concrete details like the "weathered grays" and "fading glory" of Elias's paintings. The painted seashell effectively embodies lost love, and the final transformation from painting past to present resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of seeking safety through "honest occlusion" emerges from the paradox of Elara's involuntary truthfulness enabling her to block unwanted empathy. The final line about "harvesting peace from chaos" resonates as metaphor for both literal foraging and psychological work.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the concept of borrowed memories and witnessed isolation—objects carry fragments of lives, and even the most isolated existence can become a vessel for others' stories.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    The bleeding starlight motif effectively bridges dreams and reality, gaining thematic weight when it reveals betrayal versus prophecy. The theme of truth versus deception emerges through action rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spiral motif (nautilus shell, "cycles of departure and rebirth") elegantly mirrors the relationship's transformation, and the pocket-sun as "vessel for the now" resonates with capturing ephemeral moments.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between chronicling chaos and experiencing it, with the birch bark scroll serving as both literal tool and metaphor for imposing narrative on life's disorder.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "imperfect miracles" - flawed graces that mend but leave scars.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The spiral arbitration theme emerges organically through the dictionary's "wanderingly exact" definitions and the physical/mental journey structure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral moments emerges through concrete action (the steeping ritual) rather than assertion. The walnut ink serves as an effective motif linking past and present. However, the resolution toward "haunted bliss" and spiritual reunion feels unearned, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would deepen the meditation on memory and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the rumor-chain mechanism: isolation cannot be cured alone but through mutual vulnerability. The moon rock's transformation from physical object to catalyst for connection avoids heavy symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of love persisting through technological intervention emerges through Elara's quest to reconnect with Lir via neural entanglement. The "auroral sorrow" metaphor effectively captures the beauty-in-grief paradox, though the ending's ambiguity about whether contact is real or imagined feels more like hedging than purposeful complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the dramatized contest between loud force and subtle guidance, with the zodiac coin's Scorpio landing on "transformation" resonating without overstatement. The folded maps as hidden knowledge and the storm erasing straightforward paths reinforce the theme through concrete action. Final whispered triumph avoids moralizing while proving the point.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.6)
    The darkness/stars metaphor serves the theme of finding light in moral darkness, realized through the guardian's wordless lesson. However, the thematic resolution feels prescriptive—"darkness taught the value of light" states rather than emerges. The piece tells its meaning too directly in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the chess metaphor extending to "the board was the world itself" and humble rebellion through planted doubts rather than violence. The final image of forests flourishing "in the minds of the free" resonantly answers the central question about resistance. The piece avoids moralizing, letting the synchronized displays speak through action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of authentic self versus imposed peace emerges through concrete particulars—the scrimshaw unlocking hearts, the impossible violence backdrop, the sea's persistent call. The final transformation offers a non-literal answer about freedom's price without moralizing. "Combative tenderness" effectively captures the push-pull dynamic throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of performing lightness while processing genuine grief—never stated but embodied in every theatrical narration. The dried flowers and wooden stem create a resonant metaphor for preservation versus renewal. The ending reweights all prior performance as both complicity and resistance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of paraphrasing as creative transformation rather than rigid recitation. The final verse "certainty trembles, boundaries dissolve in awe" offers a non-literal answer about art's power to commune rather than conquer. The moth-lantern imagery recurs meaningfully, though the thematic resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme emerges organically through action: beauty lies not in perfection but in accepting one's flawed perspective. The final image of Elias painting "capturing the beauty in every imperfection" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The concertina reed tongue becoming "woven into the earth's quiet symphony" reinforces acceptance of imperfection through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of connection emerges through Elara's journey and questioning, avoiding direct moralizing. The golden shadows motif recurs meaningfully, and the final image of connection as "golden shadow, warm and enveloping" resonates with prior imagery. However, the insights feel unearned without concrete struggle—phrases like "velvety echo, resilient yet fragile" remain abstract rather than emerging from specific dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of renewal emerges organically through concrete images (withered gardens, dying rose, blooming vines), avoiding explicit moralizing until Elias's direct statement "to teach your withering heart to bloom." The origami coordinates system creates a nice thematic echo of guidance and connection, though the piece could trust its imagery more without the explanatory dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of inherited wisdom versus technological hubris emerges through concrete details like the onyx-ink cards and corrupted hard drives. The measuring tape bridges generations, suggesting patterns repeat across eras. Yet the resolution tends toward explicit thematic statement ("prioritizing profit over human connection") rather than letting the imagery carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of innocence lost emerges through the civilization's rise and fall, with the historian's personal loss of innocence paralleling the historical arc. The final embrace of "beautiful ache" offers resonance, though the piece occasionally veers into abstract philosophizing about memory and time.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of preserving hope while accepting regret, with the shadow's transformation from threat to guardian embodying this complexity. The final image of "luminous regret" reweights the entire premise—hope's preservation requires acknowledging what might have been.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of adaptation and survival emerges through the chameleon metaphor and Elias's parallel transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic work feels predetermined—the chameleon's "shedding layers" metaphor is established early and mechanically executed without complication or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of seeking closure by opening wounds, with the final insight that "true closure came not from sealing wounds, but from embracing their tales." The coffee rings divination and scar-reading create concrete vehicles for abstract concepts, avoiding platitudes until the slightly explicit final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that unused love persists in physical spaces and objects. The goodbye letters concept resonates through Harlan's unsent missives to Elara's own archived affections. The final transformation from "goodbyes" to "new beginnings" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "remembered stardust" concept elegantly links human creativity to cosmic origins, emerging through action rather than exposition. The theme of reconnecting with one's essential nature resonates through the astronomical imagery. However, the resolution tends toward the transcendent without sufficient earthly complication to ground the wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of nurturing possibility from devastation emerges organically through the archive's "probabilistic echoes" and Elias's cultivation metaphor. The chess clock frozen at the moment of destruction becoming a ticking companion offers resonant non-literal meaning about resuming agency after catastrophe, avoiding any explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete fusion of mechanical and organic, with the gear as conduit between technological progress and mental wilderness. The final image of Elias "no longer stray but sovereign" resonates without stating a moral. The "probable miracles" concept manifests through the electromagnetic translocation and wind-decoded insights. Slight deduction for the abstract "wild frontier of mind" remaining somewhat conceptual rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the journey metaphor and the recurring motif of indirect paths to courage, with the star-punched ticket serving as a concrete symbol of transformation. The ending achieves resonance through "traversing not just water, but the veiled ridges of her own heart," though it edges toward explicit thematic statement in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of silence as both safety and prison. The piano bolt becomes a resonant symbol connecting past trauma to present service. The ending avoids explicit moralizing while offering a non-literal answer about redemption through confrontation. Some thematic statements feel slightly over-articulated ("true safety demanded the risk of sound").

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of truth versus pretension emerges organically through the drift rune concept - gradual separation of truth from lies. The final image of Elowen returning to eternal vigil knowing "new pretenders might arise" adds resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates through the cryptic messages themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "drifting moored"—tethered yet adrift—which resonates through Elara's vigil and humanity's relationship with irreversible change. The "periodically eternal" cycles offer redemption through persistence despite human folly. The father's hidden confession transforms witnessing from observation to active atonement, avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of finding meaning in defeat emerges through the stone circle discovery and rebel revival, though it resolves too neatly. The "mess transforming into a map of renewal" offers resonance but arrives through vision rather than dramatized struggle. The final image of the bay "thrumming with purpose" reweights the opening desolation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between rigid tradition and purposeful evolution, crystallizing in the embryo that "carried an implanted destiny, genetically woven with traits." The final image of plants "whispering secrets to all who listened" resonantly answers whether tradition can evolve while honoring the past.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the lighthouse keeper parallel and pearl-of-stillness metaphor without stating morals. The final image of walking forward "ready to face whatever came next" resonantly reweights the opening wandering, though "optimism felt grounded" briefly lapses into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the integration of artistic failure, fragmented reality, and the necessity of embracing darkness for creation. The final rhetorical question "What is art, after all, if not a rhetorical question posed to the void?" resonates without moralizing. The recurring luminescent ache effectively embodies the cost of transformation, though the connection between external fragmentation and internal artistic struggle could be more precisely drawn.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of perception under crisis emerges through the vanishing ink metaphor and time-dilation phenomenon, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the thematic resonance remains intellectual rather than emotionally earned through scene pressure. The final line about confronting the saboteur "with newfound wisdom" gestures toward application but doesn't demonstrate how this knowledge transforms anything beyond abstract understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of truth versus enforced ignorance emerges through action but resolves too neatly into "truth good, silence bad." The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("unspoken words finally finding voice") states rather than resonates. The piece lacks complexity—no genuine counter-argument for preservation exists beyond authoritarian control.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between destruction (tower's fall, father's hunting) and creation (rose cultivation, peaceful sanctuary). The sheath symbolizing "potential violence encased in quiet resolve" offers resonant subtext, though the ending edges toward explicit thematic statement with "continuity threading through every thorn and bloom."

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between possession and release, with the echo's "transliterated emotions" making abstract divinity concrete. The final image resonantly answers whether divine connection requires ownership. Minor deduction for the slightly explanatory final line about "echoes yet to come."

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the "orbits of regret" metaphor—circular patterns of family shame that trap successive generations. The final image of breaking free from these loops offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates well in Elara's "solemn playfulness" and her decision to invite rather than refute.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "lost sounds" and time folding, with the amber insect symbolizing frozen moments. The final forgiveness ("I understand, Mama. Rest") offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing. The constellation tattoos linking destiny to skin create thematic coherence. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the mandala's patterns revealing "shared path through the mess toward something whole," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of collective creation and "beauty of connection born from chaos" resonates without stating its lesson, though the "tentative peace" slightly softens what could be a more complex ending.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "aberrant mercy" and "gentle radical," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the renamed guardian following with "steps that echoed both warmth and steel" resonantly answers the central question about compassion in unfeeling systems.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the interweaving of past and present, with the orchard serving as a space where "possibilities linger." The final image of Elara carrying the coin as "synesthetic promise" resonates without stating a moral, successfully reweighting her despair through accumulated nostalgic echoes rather than explicit wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of illuminating hidden pathways between skepticism and belief emerges through concrete action, particularly the light-painting that mirrors telepathic visions. The "willowglass hope" metaphor effectively captures fragile optimism. Yet the thematic resolution tends toward explicit statement ("a way to see each other truly") rather than purely emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of bridging old and new worlds through sensory mapping emerges from concrete actions. The fossil as "transitional object" connects psychological and physical realms effectively. However, the ending's promise to "ensure the unknown was heard" states rather than embodies the theme, and no counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transforming fate through shared wisdom emerges organically from the button cataloging—each button carries a traveler's story of defying doom. The final insight that "prophecies were but echoes of choices" reweights the entire premise without explicit moralizing. The recurring motif of time (hourglasses, forgotten eras, grains of sand) effectively supports the theme of mutable destiny. Slight deduction for the abstractness of some thematic statements like "spun into possibility when wisdom was shared."

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of snow encoding—bold yet prudent, permanent yet fleeting. The ending reweights "unused courage" from grand gestures to "quiet, daring acts" without stating a moral. The spring thaw motif resonates with renewal without heavy-handedness.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The palimpsest serves as both literal object and thematic vehicle, elegantly exploring how successive generations overwrite truth while traces linger beneath. The final distillation to "protection, not possession" offers a resonant answer that reweights all prior oaths. The theme emerges organically through Elias's physical interaction with the parchment rather than abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Exceptional thematic emergence through concrete particulars - kindness as "phototropic" resistance to entropy. The pottery/impermanence parallel enriches without forcing. The final insight about "kindness rooted across time" offers a resonant non-literal answer that reweights all prior wasteland imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between the dying rosebush and renewed harbor life—beauty fades but purpose endures through careful action. The concept of "protected vulnerability" resonates through multiple layers: the creatures, Elara herself, even the prisms' delicate function. The final image of the bare rosebush knowing spring will come completes the thematic arc without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete imagery of isolation becoming forge rather than cage, with the Aetherwings serving as "mirrors of her own resilience" rather than saviors. The final insight about "necessary fractures allowing light to seep through" resonates without moralizing. Slight deduction for the independence theme being somewhat telegraphed early.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    The thread metaphor elegantly connects the thrush's spiral, human connections, and Elias's role as keeper of secrets. The installation invites collective participation in weaving connection, avoiding simple resolution. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("You've kept so many secrets—perhaps it's time to share your own") approaches thematic echo, though it's saved by being Mira's dialogue rather than narratorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of human agency versus cosmic manipulation emerges through action, avoiding direct moralizing. The trickster concept offers complexity—entities harvesting emotional energy through division. However, the resolution is too tidy; Elara's success doesn't interrogate the theme's implications about vulnerability or the cost of constant vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of rebellion against confinement emerges through concrete imagery—walls "rebelling against their solidity," spatial mutiny as literal dimensional expansion. The ending reweights claustrophobia from limitation to "distant memory," though the final line edges toward explicit thematic statement ("true freedom came not from escaping shadows, but from defying them").

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of seeing beyond surfaces resonates through Elias's face blindness and the masked victim, with "unifying opposites" working as both method and thematic principle. The final image of connections forged in shadow offers resonance. Yet the theme sometimes announces itself too directly ("unifying the factual with the emotional"), reducing subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of redemption through uncovering truth emerges organically through the copper nail's transformation from curse to key. The final image of stepping "into the mist" resonates with the ancestral weight, though the ending's hope that redemption "might calm the skies' inherited rage" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.6)
    The bridge metaphor operates both literally (Elias as bridge-song fiddler) and thematically (connection, redemption, crossing between worlds). The "pixelated amnesty" concept offers interesting complexity about fragmented forgiveness. However, the theme statement "turning 'never' into 'now'" in the final section reads as explicit moralizing, and some metaphors feel overwrought ("luminous disbelief").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The circular paths theme emerges organically through multiple layers: father's criminal legacy, LoopBack's premise, the startup's rise/fall, and the final territorial marking that breaks violent cycles. The foreign money transforms from stolen wealth to boundary markers, reweighting their meaning. The ending offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, though "glimpsed his answer" edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of shared burdens emerges organically through the inscription decode and star metaphors ("lights that dimmed alone but brightened in unison"). The final revelation avoids explicit moralizing, though phrases like "communal solace" and "profound solace of connection" edge toward thematic summary. The daylily's "ephemeral beauty" creates subtext about fleeting connection.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of discovering "what mirrors don't show" emerges through concrete action—Elowen must literally unbend her rigid defenses to access hidden truths. The frozen confession as physical manifestation of concealed regret works well. Final revelation that "the failed trick had been no accident, but a catalyst for truths long lost" resonates without moralizing, though some thematic statements edge toward directness.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the intersection metaphor—individual wounds creating collective healing. The eclipsed covenant's revival through shared scars avoids simple moralizing. Final image of "root-bound soul unbound" resonantly answers the unity question without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete mechanics of bartering destinies and the physical manifestation of souls having "holes" that can be patched. The burned tarot card serves as both literal tool and thematic anchor - the half-consumed Fool stepping forward despite flames. Minor deduction for occasionally explicit thematic language like "inlaying meaning everywhere," though it's integrated into the magical system rather than pure abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "after the applause" theme emerges organically through the quarry's echoes, the band's hit song title, and Jack's journey from roadie to appraiser to museum founder. The speaker cloth transforms from "junk" to tether to catalyst without heavy-handed symbolism. The ending reweights "appraising others' relics" versus "honoring his own" effectively. Some passages like "echo valley longing" and "purpose reborn" edge toward explicit theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the physics-of-transition metaphor: "Just as the seed must transition from dormancy to growth by embedding in soil, so too might a soul embed in the fabric of memory." The final image resonantly answers whether connection survives death through transformed understanding rather than literal presence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of finding wonder within routine emerges through the librarian's repeated ritual and the concept of "tomorrow disappeared." The fusion of contradictory identities ("accept the storm within peace, and peace within the storm") offers a non-literal answer about unity through acceptance. However, the thematic resolution feels prescribed rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of abandoned hopes finding renewal emerges organically through the bunker's artifacts and confessions, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final "unity was crowned." The pearl as vessel for collective hopes offers resonance. Yet the thematic resolution tends toward the sentimental with phrases like "bearer of hope" that feel unearned in their optimism.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the river/path metaphor system without explicit moralizing—floods as inevitable tragedy that creates new channels parallels Elias's journey toward accepting his altered life path. The graffiti wisdom provides resonant, non-literal answers that avoid platitudes. The final image of Elias stepping through parting ivy with "steps daring yet measured" offers a perfect thematic synthesis of acceptance without erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete action of revealing "silenced confessions, regrets never voiced, dreams deferred" rather than abstract statements. The unfolding cipher concept integrates naturally with the thematic question of giving voice to the voiceless. However, the ending's assertion that words are "finally set free" feels unearned without showing their actual impact.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of weighing individual dreams against collective duty emerges through concrete choices and the violin's power to "perforate destiny," offering a nuanced answer about finding gaps rather than choosing absolutes. The coffee stains creating "fractured crowns and blooming vines" provides strong visual subtext, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the beautician-mortician paradox and pattern-finding in chaos, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final question "How many more could she save before her own threshold arrived?" reweights her role without stating conclusions. The recurring aurora/emerald light creates coherent symbolism of preservation against void.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of renewal through caregiving emerges organically from the grotto's purpose and Elara's journey from forgiveness to understanding contentment. The hairpin's wave-shaped prongs and scalloped veils create resonant imagery of cycles, though the final insight ("caregiving itself") arrives somewhat abstractly without sufficient embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "cloak of doubt" metaphor elegantly reweights from literal garment to philosophical stance, culminating in the lighthouse as "beacon not of unwavering light, but of the nuanced glow." Theme emerges through concrete objects (mirror shard, cloak, chimes) without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.9)
    The backwards aging concept and "vanishing to appear" philosophy cohere thematically through the pond ripples metaphor. The withholding-as-teaching method reinforces the theme of gradual revelation. However, the final insight arrives through direct explanation ("you see: to teach vanishing to appear...") rather than earned realization, undermining resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of stillness conquering wandering emerges through the central metaphor, but the final paragraph states this explicitly: "stillness could conquer wandering, and harmony could mend what time had frayed." The piece builds resonance through the pulse/harmony imagery but undermines it with direct thematic summary. No concrete cost or consequence tests the thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the contrast between automated perfection and "sacred simplicity," culminating in the keystone's revelation that "No algorithm could replicate this lingering luminance." The final image of light that would "linger eternally in his underachieving heart" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, some thematic statements edge toward the explicit ("what automation had stolen").

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of hidden knowledge and sensory revelation—"where knowledge hid behind truth." The story explores how reality contains layers of perception we cannot access without transformation. The ending beautifully reweights the opening as Elias returns to his lamps with new eyes, making the ordinary luminous without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the backwards prophecy concept—tracing effects to origins mirrors the story's exploration of endings birthing beginnings. The foreign coins as "lots" for decision-making in collapsed certainty resonates with the larger uncertainty about cosmic cycles. The final whisper reweights stellar doubt from despair to fuel for tentative hope, though some philosophical assertions ("doubt as fuel") edge toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete crystallization of intangible fears without stating morals. The final image of "quiet legacy" and "finding solace in the dusk's embrace" reweights the sacrifice from loss to transformation, though some naming feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of restoration emerges through the bell-mending ritual and spectral fish, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the story doesn't complicate its premise—naive earnestness simply succeeds without examining the cost of cosmic imbalance or why the seas failed. The ending's "new equilibrium" feels unearned without exploring what was traded for restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of submerged town/submerged memory, with the distillery's blue elixir serving as a symbol of vanished prosperity. The story resists tidy resolution, allowing grief and renewal to coexist. However, phrases like "expunging solitude through storytelling" and "binding them in shared meaning" lean toward explicit thematic statement rather than earned resonance, particularly in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of harmonizing logic and intuition emerges through the contrast between Elara's calculations and the starlings' intuitive guidance, with the final talisman embodying this synthesis. However, the resolution feels too neat—the harmony arrives without genuine tension between the opposing forces. The "ancient freshness" paradox works conceptually but lacks dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of innovation under pressure emerges through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in the muscle memory sequences that bridge past training to present crisis. The "soundless echo" motif reinforces isolation while enabling deep thought. Some thematic tidiness in the resolution ("peril into possibility") prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of wholeness through integration of opposites emerges organically from the conflict, with the "fire to my ice" recognition providing non-literal resonance. The final merger offers a complex answer about identity that resists simple resolution. However, some thematic articulation feels explicit ("we are mirrors") rather than purely embodied. The blade's symbolic function as truth-revealer supports but doesn't fully transcend its metaphorical convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of creative renewal through receptive, orthogonal thinking emerges organically through the seed metaphor and water imagery. The corpse flower's death-bloom paradox offers thematic richness. Yet the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("testament to orthogonal thinking and receptive wonder") veers toward thesis statement rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "tending to the unspoken"—grief's silencing effect and the healing power of acknowledged memory. The leaf blower transforms from comic instrument to poignant ghost-tool, avoiding sentimentality through its inherent absurdity. The ending's "some symphonies played on forever" resonates without explicit moralizing, reweighting the entire haunting as both burden and gift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the interiorization of exteriors metaphor and the transformation of displacement into integration. The final image of uncertainty walking "beside it like an old friend" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Some passages edge toward explicit philosophizing ("What if displacement was not loss but transformation?") but the overall effect builds from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The creative destruction theme emerges organically through Elias's repeated breaking and remaking of the crozier, with the broken bishop's staff serving as a perfect emblem for authority transformed. The "frozen bloom" imagery effectively captures resilience amid desolation throughout. The theme slightly falters when the curse revelation arrives as stated insight ("stifling illusion he had perpetuated through fear") rather than fully dramatized realization, though the successive approximation pattern carries strong thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between city's abandonment/dormancy and Elara's loss/growth, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "shard of hush" as weighted silence holding unspoken stories enriches the thematic texture. The ending reweights prior material effectively, though the insight "loss forging her into a better interpreter" edges toward abstraction rather than earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of connection across fractured realities emerges through the literal merging of timelines, with "permanent transient" serving as a conceptual frame. The final image of passengers carrying "starlight in their eyes" offers resonance, but the piece relies heavily on explicit statements like "where vanishings led to rebirths" rather than letting theme emerge purely through action. The concept of unity through transience has potential but needs more embodied development.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of sinew thread binding "souls across distances and deaths" without stating morals. The ending's revelation that "connections weren't lost, merely rewoven in the mind's optical illusions" reweights the gallery setting and weaving action, though the final line edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of expanding horizons beyond limitations emerges organically through the chain link's "endless cycle" and the unfolding geometric projections. The final vow about "balance" and avoiding "hubris" provides thematic resonance. However, the piece tends toward explicit thematic statements ("beauty born of loss") rather than letting complexity emerge purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "contact tracing for hearts"—tracking emotional residues across time. The final image of Elara's "own heart mending slightly" offers a non-literal answer about how helping others can heal oneself. Subtext operates effectively through the hearing aid's function and the photograph's deterioration, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("proving that tracing hearts could heal more than intended").

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of remembering the forgotten emerges clearly but remains surface-level—Alex literally frees forgotten souls without the act transforming his understanding. The codex provides answers rather than Alex earning insight through struggle. The ending's "found a piece of himself" feels unearned without showing what specific piece or how.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of learning from failure emerges organically through Alex's bureaucratic "death" and Elara's fatal experiment, with "embrace the fracture, for in mending lies strength" crystallizing the insight. The porcelain shard symbolizes "fragility of ambition" effectively. However, Elara's explicit articulation "failure is the forge" and the final paragraph's direct thematic statements ("not in forgetting failure, but in its tender lessons") undercut subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of translating texture into sound—preservation through transformation rather than static recording. The flawed diamond's curse becoming guardian elegantly embodies the theme of finding purpose in imperfection. The final image of eternal echoes singing textures offers resonant closure without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of loss becoming evolution emerges through Elara's transformation, turning her bitterness into "cosmic joke" as she joins her brother's fate. The concept feels somewhat forced in execution—the story tells us about "untamed harmony" more than showing how this principle operates through specific choices and consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    The transformation metaphor embedded in the locust shell effectively parallels the orchard's journey from constraint to freedom. Theme emerges through concrete action as music literally uproots mechanical overlay. However, phrases like "beauty could be uprooted and set free" and "proving that even in a mechanical world" edge toward explicit moralizing in the final paragraph, diminishing the resonance that the imagery alone could carry.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of connection across division emerges through concrete actions—the child's drawing, the faded photo—rather than stated morals. The recurring "linking absences" motif accumulates meaning, though the final lines drift toward abstraction ("glimpsed the healing") rather than maintaining the story's concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "interpreting silence as possibility" emerges organically through Elias's journey from mute carpenter to singing artist, with the halo fragment and wind bells serving as concrete vehicles for transformation rather than abstract symbols. The final image of him ready to "carve not just wood, but worlds from the quiet possibilities ahead" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the integration of analog vs. digital memory, geometric infinity, and story origins without explicit moralizing. The final image of returning "anytime through the geometry of memory" resonantly answers the central question while maintaining complexity about narrative's birthplace.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of absence becoming presence emerges organically through the photography metaphor, with light painting serving as bridge between loss and recovery. The final image of sharing vitalized dreams with library visitors offers resonance without stating a moral. The cipher/code motif effectively links longing to decoding, though some thematic statements ("luminous absence") feel overly explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of "enveloped secrets" as cocoons awaiting the right key. The ending reweights this concept as Elias realizes "his motivation had bridged more than ideas—it had touched the eternal." The lock of hair's transformation from memory token to literal bridge resonates thematically without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of curiosity's cost emerges through particulars but resolves too neatly - the "theft" becomes a benign "whim" and wisdom exchange. The final image attempts resonance but "ready for whatever curiosity beckoned next" suggests no real learning or change from the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of resilience through confronting failure emerges from events, particularly the shadow metaphor and tea leaf geometry. The combative tenderness method embodies the theme. But the resolution feels too neat - Kael's transformation lacks the messiness of genuine growth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of preserving wonder emerges organically through Elowen's actions and the story's imagery rather than explicit statement. The final image of the wonder-tree drawing cynical adults back to childlike awe offers a resonant answer to the central question. The concept avoids moralizing while maintaining thematic coherence through the weaving metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "interlaced hush"—how silence accumulates weight over time until truth must be exhumed. The net as repository of "unspoken sorrows" and the masks as vessels for unquiet spirits create layered meaning without explicit moralizing. The final transformation of "interlaced hush" into "grounding calm" offers resonant closure, though the resolution of all spirits simultaneously feels thematically convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the tension between forceful revelation and empathetic interpretation, crystallizing when silence becomes "a canvas for unspoken grief and hope." The final image of reopening through "seeing the silence anew" offers resonant answer without moralizing, though "forgotten empathies" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the snow globe's "particles clinging, then drifting apart under invisible laws" mirroring grief's physics. The note's message about "surrender to gravity's pull" resonates without moralizing. Final image of "echoes teach us to drift free" reweights the opening without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of unspoken needs finding voice emerges through the graffiti encoding and final liberation, with the closing promise of "stories yet to be sung." The flower/binary fusion imagery ("roses scripted with ones and zeros") integrates digital and organic meaningfully. However, the theme explicitly states itself multiple times ("articulate unspoken needs," "unspoken needs etched there"), reducing resonance through direct declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the diary's parallel journey of "anguish of endless winter, I sought the joy of fleeting warmth" mirroring Elias's own quest. The final image of "keeper of encrypted light" offers a non-literal answer about preserving rather than releasing joy, avoiding moralizing while maintaining resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "spooled wholeness" and the broken string, avoiding explicit moralizing until the slight lapse in the final paragraphs. The categorization method (clouds by emotion) creates rich subtext about how grief shapes perception. The final image of Mira's face woven from mist offers a resonant answer about memory's persistence in absence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the fractal coin's "self-similar designs" mirroring both the tree's roots and Elara's perceptual condition. The concept of discovering limits through attempting the infinite resonates without explicit statement. Final image of the "crafted sky" that will "linger in memory" despite demolition offers non-literal answer to the limitation/transcendence question.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of isolation and connection, with Elias's "sociable isolation" capturing both physical separation and cosmic connection to migratory patterns. The hopscotch board as childhood game transformed into navigation cipher adds thematic resonance. The ending's promise of "wonders yet to be charted" avoids explicit moralizing while suggesting exploration's endless horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of repair as both mechanical (gears) and temporal (eclipses), with the final image offering a non-literal answer about carrying knowledge despite nostalgic loss. The recurring driftwood/weathered wood imagery effectively charges the ending, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing ("frayed threads of time itself").

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of unity emerging from diversity is present but delivered through explicit statements ("Together, pull the chord—respite awaits the family") rather than dramatized complexity. The ghost's altruism and the group's cooperation feel predetermined rather than earned through specific struggle. Final paragraph moralizing ("Hope blooms in unity") replaces resonant scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the puppet head's "beautifully flawed" cracks mirroring creation's impermanence and the nested patterns within patterns. The final image of the lullaby as "a beautifully flawed beacon of bruised awe" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece embraces complexity in accepting both beauty and inevitable decay.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of inherited duty versus personal freedom emerges organically through action, culminating in "graceless beauty of a life, saving others from the fate she couldn't escape herself." The orchard's cursed fruit and the blueprint create resonant parallels about dangerous knowledge. Some middle passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the braiding metaphor—separation enriching the whole rather than destroying it—without explicit moralizing. The chrysalis, foam patterns, and polymer chains create a coherent symbolic system about transformation and connection that avoids heavy-handedness. The final image of mother and daughter tracing the sculpture together offers a non-literal answer to whether fractured bonds can reform stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of origins and beginnings emerges through concrete action (incising voids, quantifying absence) rather than declaration, with the final image of Elara becoming "the first story born anew" offering a non-literal answer about creative genesis. The "clean slates" motif accumulates meaning from commercial product to metaphysical tool to abandoned legacy, though some passages like "pure potential, a blank expanse pulsing with unborn words" edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of confronting and transforming regret emerges organically through the metaphor of "sandpapering rough memories." The coral pavilion as repository for world's regrets provides conceptual resonance. The final image of Elias emerging with "memories sanded smooth" offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though it risks tidiness over complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of connection across divides emerges through the central metaphor of "constructing bridges from silos." The interspersing of languages reinforces unity through diversity. Yet the resolution feels overly neat—skepticism "melting" without dramatized resistance, unity "blooming" without showing the messy work of reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of excavating abandoned dreams emerges clearly through the archaeological metaphor and synaptic plasticity concept. However, the resolution feels predetermined - Elias simply decides to reframe his memories without genuine discovery or earned insight arising from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of hidden knowledge emerges through concrete details like the manuscript's clandestine luminosity and the grotto's secrets. The "prism-minded" conceit of refracting singular ideas into possibilities resonates with navigating multiple paths. However, the ending offers no resonant answer to thematic questions—Elara simply acquires power without confronting what forgotten knowledge costs or means.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of analyzing fractures as musical notation—brokenness becoming the source of harmony. The ending offers resonant answer without stating moral: empathy flows through shared vibration rather than words. Strong integration of "empathy in motion" as both concept and lived experience. The tears and grove's response avoid sentimentality through specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the chess-as-life metaphor: "beauty in the difficult" manifests in the dented stone, the scarred chessboard, the eclipse's temporary darkness. The final image of Elias turning away "ready for whatever gambit the dawn might bring" resonates without stating morals. The correlation between magnetic forces and internal turmoil creates layered meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the cataloging of silence types as pathways to empathy, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final line's "quiet of forgiveness." The brother's confession that he "envied your peace" recontextualizes the entire conflict without stating a lesson. Subtext operates effectively through the described silence types that reveal unspoken emotional truths.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding wisdom in apparent chaos emerges organically through the corpse flower metaphor - beauty/renewal from death-stench. The journaling on wrapping paper creates a nice thematic echo of hidden truths within discarded surfaces. However, Elara's explicit articulation "serenity thrives not in stillness, but in embracing the flow" edges toward thesis statement, and the village's inspiration feels too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of resilience emerges through the concrete discovery of the arrow tip and its growth-accelerating properties. The echoes provide backstory about ancient guardians seeding life, but this remains expository rather than creating present friction. The final line attempts thematic resonance ("secrets, once hidden in silent whirls, now promised renewal") but reads as summary rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of foresight versus catastrophic convergence emerges through the investigation's particulars, with the wind patterns and patch discovery embodying how small factors align destructively. The concept of "singular convergence" effectively unifies the physical and thematic elements. However, the ending explicitly states the theme ("foresight needed to avert the next") rather than letting it emerge purely through image and action, and some passages feel like thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of wonder's necessity emerges through imagery but relies heavily on direct statement ("to certify wonder as essential"). The synesthetic colors and aurora create resonant imagery but the thematic conclusion feels asserted rather than earned through dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transforming failure into wisdom emerges organically through the ritual's weaving metaphor and Elara's concrete visions of past mistakes. The flute's ability to "weave between worlds" literalizes the thematic journey from isolation to connection. The final shift from hoarding relics alone to forging alliances offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit articulation of lessons learned ("humility in guardianship, the folly of isolation").

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of quantifying the unquantifiable emerges organically through Elias's letterpress work and the ambiguous phrases he prints. The final insight about emotions as "dynamic functions" that refuse full solution resonates without moralizing. The transposed empathy concept integrates well, though it could more concretely alter Elias's tactics rather than remaining largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of wonder germinating through sympathetic resonance emerges organically through the pendant's effect on Kael, avoiding explicit moralizing until Thorne's quoted wisdom provides context rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concept of objects as emotional vessels without explicit moralizing. The "truthful lies" paradox operates effectively as Elara fabricates surface details to reveal deeper emotional truths. The final image of Marcus leaving "changed" while Elara remains "firmly grounded" offers resonant answer to whether pain can be externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of sacrifice for connection emerges organically through Elara's weaving of memory into physical form, with the amber bead encasing preserved hope. The final image of the loom standing silent while Elara dissolves into whispers offers resonant answer to the central question, though the explicit message "I love you, find your way home" undercuts subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of resilience emerging from destruction resonates through the arc, with the rubble-to-guardians transformation serving as the central metaphor. However, the thematic resolution feels somewhat mechanical, lacking the complexity that would elevate it beyond a straightforward restoration narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "weaving between worlds" as Elara literally navigates parallel realities to uncover buried truth. The weight of withheld truth manifests physically through the shard and emotionally through the brother's sacrifice. The final image of stepping "into the dawn of awakening" offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing, reweighting the opening's "dim haze."

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of safety as something that must be actively maintained and passed on emerges through the letter chain tradition and crystallizes when Elias extends it to the spectral realm. The sea glass functions as more than ornament, literally bottling safety in tangible form. The final image of "stacking messages for whoever needed to bottle that precious safety next" offers resonant closure without stating a moral, though some thematic connections feel slightly over-determined.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of bridging ancient wisdom with digital-age enlightenment emerges through imagery but remains abstract. The contrast between print newspapers and digital screens suggests commentary on information authenticity, yet this never develops beyond conceptual decoration. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("proving her accidentally prophetic nature") rather than letting it emerge from dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of how stories magnetize to those who "illuminate gently" emerges through concrete imagery of light refraction, sun trails, and the iridescent wing rather than statement. The donor heart serves as embodied subtext for inherited narrative pull. The final image of dyeing fabrics with "newfound hues, each thread a story" offers resonant answer without moralizing, though "quietly explosive" borders on oxymoronic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "quantified sorrow" and trees as witnesses to resilience. The sextant that "heals in moonlight" becomes a powerful metaphor for transformation of grief. The ending offers a non-literal answer—trees witness "the mundane miracle of enduring"—that reweights the entire maintenance work as sacred. Strong thematic coherence without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of connection through shared memory emerges through the ritual's mechanics, as "forgotten songs" literally knit isolated spirits together. The final image of communities "bound in harmonious release" resonates, though the piece occasionally states its themes directly ("the attribute that knits communities together").

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The nested paradoxes theme effectively structures the story—vulnerability breeding strength, isolation fostering connection. The ending achieves resonance when Elias's reclusion births compassion through the anonymous note. However, some thematic statements feel overly explicit ("where hiding revealed truths, and reclusion birthed compassion"), and the wisdom feels more declared than dramatized through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between decay and renewal, with the bread from the vanished bakery serving as tangible symbol of loss feeding new growth. The final image of "secret warmth" in winter resonates without stating a moral. The concept of finding "sacred in the ordinary" integrates naturally through guerrilla gardening acts.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of preserving ephemeral promises - memory versus oblivion resonates without being stated.

The final image of vials as "a beacon against the endless fade" offers a non-literal answer about preservation's value.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the parallel between capturing "the sound of trust breaking" and Elara's own use of betrayal to achieve justice. The watch fob transforms from memorial to instrument of justice. The ending resonates without stating a moral - vengeance achieved through the very methods that destroyed her father.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "nostalgia for chaos" in an over-stabilized world emerges organically through the weather-carriers' existence. The forest elections and personal weather systems create a rich thematic texture about control versus wildness. The final image of Elara carrying "a piece of the cosmos within" resonates. Slight deduction for the weather-carrier's overly articulate thematic explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of creative suppression/uncorking emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the lock serving as physical manifestation of self-imposed artistic prison. The final image of "charcoal fingers dancing with renewed purpose" resonates without moralizing. However, the theme resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the truth-detecting leaves and crystalline orbs without explicit moralizing. The final image of reclaimed honesty flourishing under a poisoned sky offers genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between silence and expression, with the kinetic sculpture serving as a non-verbal answer to preserving wonder. The final image of "wonder's color shone undimmed" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The iceberg fragment's transformation from frozen silence to prismatic symphony embodies the thematic question beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of wholeness through fragmentation emerges organically through Elara's journey from containing inherited fears to integrating them. The final image of "guardian of roses and remembrances alike" resonates without stating a moral. Strong subtext in the parallel between creator's childhood fears and Elara's fragmented existence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme emerges organically through the act of storytelling itself - each tale reveals how silence breeds pain while sharing enables healing. The locket photo of Maria provides resonant closure. Yet the theme feels slightly over-determined, with every element pointing too neatly toward the same moral without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into strength emerges through concrete actions (journal encryption, dance interpretation) rather than statement. The dice as "game of fate" and the spider-web metaphor create thematic coherence, and the final surfacing reweights earlier isolation. However, the digital consciousnesses revelation feels unearned thematically, introducing a collective liberation theme without prior development.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of deletion/recovery, with the whale as catalyst for unearthing what was buried. The pressed wildflowers serve as physical anchors to deleted memories, avoiding abstract philosophizing. The ending reweights the opening's "secrets" and "gleaming silence" without stating a moral. Minor deduction for slight thematic convenience in the whale's role.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of silence versus chaos emerges through the ritual's imagery and the "terrestrially cosmic" bridge between earth and sky. The crane's origami wing carries symbolic weight as a mediator between worlds. However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and the final peace arrives without interrogating the complexity of suppressing prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through "the language of old buildings was not just words, but the stories we agree to believe." The seal and meteors work as concrete vehicles for abstract truth about shared fiction. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in the final line being too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elara and the guardian - both isolated by tragedy, seeking independence through quarantine. The final image of the "seashell half now whole in spirit" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The isolation-to-independence transformation avoids simple resolution, acknowledging that "true independence was not solitude's end, but its masterful translation."

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of forgiveness and completing unfinished work emerges through concrete action—the forgeries as "calibrated treason" completing Silas's vision. The final image of being "unlinked from her past" resonates without stating a moral. The heritage rose thorn symbolism of "pricks of conscience" feels slightly heavy-handed but doesn't overwhelm the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of completion versus lingering emerges organically through the echo metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. The revelation that her mother's silence meant fulfillment rather than loss offers genuine resonance. The story explores the complexity of memory and grief through concrete imagery, though the resolution of Thorne's subplot feels thematically disconnected from the personal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of carefully woven truth versus destructive revelation emerges through the contrast between the captain's buried betrayal and Elara's gentle exposure method.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of hidden effort emerges organically through concrete imagery—net-mending, tea-whisking, moon paths—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias descending with "spirit alight" while the stones hold "secrets now partly his own" offers a resonant answer about shared understanding. The piece avoids tidy resolution, leaving the actual teaching as future possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that the "curse" is fabricated to protect scientific truth. The diamond as "hidden stillpoint" creating calm amid chaos resonates literally and metaphorically.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of "ancient shadows" and "new dawn," with the paradox that yesterday's fragments can birth tomorrow's light. The final broadcast—"We shape the morrow with yesterday's shade"—offers resonant synthesis without moralizing. However, the theme occasionally surfaces too explicitly in Elias's pronouncements rather than remaining fully submerged in image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of gleaned redemption emerges through concrete particulars—jars of captured sounds, the rescued music box, the fusion of past and present. The final image of "weaving threads between generations, one jar at a time" resonates without stating a moral. However, some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing ("redemption wasn't bestowed but gleaned").

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    The sonic absolution concept integrates thoroughly with plot mechanics and thematic exploration of forgiveness. The final image of Elias experiencing his own guilt through "vibrational grace" offers resonant closure without moralizing. Theme emerges from the lighthouse-as-beacon parallel and the orb's dual nature (weapon or absolution), though some passages edge toward explicit ("protecting the sacred artifact for those who might one day seek true sonic absolution").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The patience/impatience dialectic emerges through concrete actions rather than statements, with the moon paths serving as both literal navigation and metaphor for gradual resistance. The final image of "whispers of unyoking" spreading "softly purposeful" resonates without moralizing. The revolution-as-tide metaphor occasionally feels overwrought but mostly earns its keep through specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of entangled trauma across generations emerges through the Underground Railroad lantern and spectral influences, with Marcus's death mirroring historical escapes. The final image of "vulnerability fortified into unyielding strength" resonates, though the thematic resolution tends toward the abstract rather than emerging from concrete dramatic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the clockwork heart metaphor ("wound too tight by regret") and the concept of second opinions moving beyond solitary judgment. The final image of the beating heart effectively reweights prior material without stating a moral, though phrases like "to turn an apology into action" occasionally make subtext too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The yearning algorithm as artificial desire elegantly explores purpose versus function, emerging through concrete invention rather than assertion. The kaleidoscope method transforms runes into "digital dreams," offering resonant synthesis of ancient and mechanical. However, the ending's claim about awakening leviathans feels unearned without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of erasure/preservation emerges organically through deleted profiles, vanished astronauts, and self-erasing truth. The patch functions as both literal artifact and thematic anchor for what survives deletion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming passive empathy into active compassion emerges organically through the mirror visions showing hunger, migration burdens, and resource conflicts. The reconstituted orb becomes a living metaphor for unified action from fractured perspectives.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the parasol's transformation from "fragile barrier against the sun's glare" to Arctic divining rod, and patience folding "not in despair, but in release." The final image of "beginning folded within" ending resonates without stating its moral.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "destined mismatches" evolves from bitter loss to "destiny's way of teaching us to connect," earned through concrete parallels between their stories. The burned letter transforms from symbol of loss to "spark that could kindle new beginnings," though the final line states the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through the preservation of "fragile whispers of enlightenment" and Elar's role as one who sees "truths others ignored," suggesting knowledge requires active guardianship. The final image of wisdom echoing in stone while Elar vanishes offers resonance without stated moral. Subtext operates through the half-mask symbolism and peripheral awareness method, though some thematic statements edge toward the explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of collective healing through shared recognition emerges through the arc metaphor and the vines' upward growth, with Lila's insight ("climbing together, stronger") providing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)

    The grafting metaphor (moss on stone, new meaning on wounds) resonates throughout without becoming heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of creation requiring extraction from others' stories, with Elias's "ephemeral cameo appearances" dignifying hopes while questioning artistic parasitism.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    The perpetual motion paradox creates thematic coherence - the impossibility Elias once proved now traps him. The chipped die as "imperfection in all systems" offers concrete symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    The noble lies theme emerges through the illuminated letter's revelation and Elias's response, with some complexity in showing how benevolent deceptions perpetuate harm.

    The theme of transformation and eternal bonds emerges through the metamorphosis and spirit-merging, with the fortune's message ("Embrace the change that calls") resonating through action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)

It embraces complexity without moralizing, offering a profound, earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transformation emerges organically from the texture of events and the final image, resisting direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around humility in the face of gradual change, organically braided through butterfly dust and neutron star analogs. The final image reweights earlier material without resorting to plot mechanics. However, lines like “No longer could she view change as mere data” verge on didactic, dimming subtext. The resonance still lands due to concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring images (frost, light, charcoal) build an organic theme of transmutation and finding meaning “in the pauses.” However, the explicit moralizing (“not of smuggling’s darkness, but of transforming hardship into art” and the grandmother’s didactic note) reduces subtext. The ending offers a resonant answer, but it risks neatness over ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect remains, if slightly curated.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece coherently explores art as translation of emotion, resilience amid enforced hush, and the body as instrument. Recurring images (frozen melodies, unshaken marvels) accrue and reweight at the end when beauty becomes voiced. A few on‑the‑nose phrases (“rectified the void”) lightly flatten subtext. Still, the final image delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motifs (lens, signals, chased stillness) accrue into a resonant meditation on labor, custody of the dead, and transforming turmoil into repose. The final image reweights prior material—stillness no longer flees—without moralizing. Insights feel earned through work rather than stated thesis, though “permanent address” edges toward explicitness. Ambiguity remains purposeful and contained.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of solidarity, secrecy versus declaration, and intergenerational reciprocity recur through concrete acts (parcels, bell, clasped hands). The ending image reweights prior anonymity into communal action. Some lines verge on moralizing (“let us declare our unity openly”), which flattens ambiguity. Subtext exists but is often stated outright.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Compassion, self-forgiveness, and reclamation emerge organically through the camera’s inversion, sparks, and fog motifs that shift meaning at the end.

The theme is coherent and affecting if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsession with time’s rough weave vs. the price of touching it emerges organically from action and images. The final smile toward a new maze reads as a repricing: knowledge gained, artifact lost, echoes fading—no moralizing. Recurring “fading photograph” imagery deepens the theme without announcing it. A hair more ambiguity around the ethical calculus of breaking the fragment could have added depth.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resilience versus looting/false liberation is embodied through seeds, the arrow’s “directed growth,” and the funhouse reversal of greed. The final image (green shoots) reweights the conflict without moralizing. A repeated diction motif (“staggering grace”) risks over-signaling theme. Still, the imagery coheres into a resonant, non-literal answer about patient defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic throughline—absence as generative, pain transmuted into meaning—emerges from concrete acts (collecting voids, imprinting). The final repricing (“from absences, new trusts might bloom”) is earned by the ritual’s cost and avoids sermonizing. Subtext lives in object choices (bell without ring, torn log) rather than abstract statement. Slight neatness in the final sentence is tempered by the tears and felt hurt.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of creation vs. capture and “illuminated moments” evolve through concrete acts (moonbeam release, floral cipher) rather than explanation. The final act reweights the premise—portraits as maps, not trophies—without moralizing. Subtext surfaces in the ear-to-wall gesture as a quiet, resonant answer to the opening drive. A touch more on-cost embodiment would elevate the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The landscape thaw mirroring a thawing heart is elegantly braided through action (breath into glass; embedding the bookmark). The piece invites reflection on grief, sanctuary, and judgment without sermonizing. A few lines state the theme outright (“The core concept of his work mirrored his inner journey”), blunting subtext. The final charged poise—leaving with spheres—reweights prior images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of betrayal-as-catalyst and vulnerability-as-strength arise from concrete acts (phobia-embrace, code as childhood safeguard). However, explicit moralizing in the last lines blunts subtext and compresses complexity. The seashell/cast return offers a resonant answer about inherited fear becoming tool. A touch more implication and less declaration would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Ambered hush” and “summarizing silence” evolve from motif to meaning, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation-by-silence as defiance of oblivion. No moralizing; the imagery carries the argument. The final closure reweights prior images (pebble shore, star, gold leaf) with conceptual cost. Complex without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres—mundane acts as portals to the mystical; identity formed by convergence—realized through the violin’s resonance and the thawing blooms. Subtext operates through image more than dialogue, with a strong early→final reprise. However, explicit thesis lines (“Thoughts…came from convergence”; “proving flawless”) edge into telling, blunting lingering ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme arises largely through images (tickets, lens, rain, crystalline hush) culminating in mutual exposure; the final exchange reweights mistrust into connection. However, the explicit thesis line (“The core concept crystallized: freed by honesty…”) is a Thematic Echo that overstates what the scene already shows, dulling resonance. Subtext otherwise functions through gesture and shared vision. The ambiguity of the visions nicely resists tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The care‑over‑luck theme emerges organically through Elias’s craft and the maze’s response, with the marbles providing a resonant ritual. The ending offers a concrete counter‑valuation of measurable fate. However, the thesis is spoken aloud—“This garden knows its gardener”—which flirts with moralizing and flattens subtext. The piece remains moving but a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres around discovery tempered by cost, mirrored by “subdued awakenings” in science and creatures. The final acceptance (shut down, celebrate) reads as restraint rather than conquest, hinting at earned stasis. Some lines tilt toward declarative wrap-up (“forever altering the hush”) instead of letting image carry resonance. Still, the hush motif reweights meaning effectively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silence vs. disruption and the “in-between spaces” theme is embodied in action—he breaks the hush to speak with the dead through sound. Recurring images (lantern flicker, water, unstruck chords) accrue meaning and reweight the final stillness. No moral is stated; resonance arises from particulars. The ending image reframes art as passage without tidy certitude.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through action and motif (fault tolerance, margins, tremor, aurora) rather than sermonizing. The final repricing—the truth measured in years rather than units—reweights earlier images with emotional charge. Thorne’s brief exposition risks on-the-nose symbolism but is redeemed by the tactile payoff. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of labor’s haunt, inherited denial, and skepticism transformed are integrated through particulars (radio callers mirroring his secret; wheel as pseudo‑sacramental). The final water image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (washing the burden). A few moments state symbolism too directly (“not just monetary, but symbolic”), trimming some subtlety. Overall, subtext outpaces any brief moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: regeneration through non‑judgmental witnessing, the cost and solace of neutrality, and time’s impartial drift. Recurring images (swan, river, silence) accrue meaning and reweight at the end as he resumes the cycle. The line “a distant civilization discovering the art of folding paper into swans” elegantly refracts the premise without moralizing. A touch of direct labeling (“His motivation was simple yet profound”) slightly blunts subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance arises from the locket, music, and celestial image reweighting “ordinary magic” without needing a didactic wrap. However, explicit thesis statements (“magic wasn’t in grand spells…” and “this eclipse links us all”) undercut subtext, especially late. The final image of touch under the corona does much of the work elegantly. The piece invites reflection but trims its own mystery with overt articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—memory housed in matter, the porous border of dream and waking, and the ethics of preservation after catastrophe—emerges through particulars (ash‑charred diaries, axis mundi, dragons as balance guardians). The final turn to hope reweights earlier images without moralizing. Occasional exposition (“triggered by ancient rituals”) is functional but less textured than surrounding scene work. Resonance lingers via image rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around open secrets redirected into harmony; recurring images (waves, beam, transposition) unify the piece. Subtext exists in the ethics of manipulating revelation, though the outcomes skew tidy. The ending offers a resonant answer—enigma to enlightenment—without overt moralizing. Complexity is present but softened by symmetrical uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—silence as strength, the exposure of assumptions—emerges through specific tactics (looping, pausing) and a final image that reweights stillness. Occasional near-thesis lines (“illuminate hidden assumptions”) verge on telling, but the silence pause earns the insight. Resonance lingers more as conceptual repricing than emotional wound. It avoids sermonizing at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The spiral/mirror motifs accumulate into a non‑didactic answer: memory’s recursion can be conducted forward. The ending image (silent crescendo and the written fortune) reweights prior particulars without sermonizing. A couple of phrases edge toward overt statement (“maestro of destinies yet to be”), but the images carry the thematic load. Resonance lingers through the fortune’s line rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: power vs. love vs. solitude, and the procedural revisiting that exposes rot and echoing pain. The forgiveness of the “child afraid of falling” reweights the premise without moralizing, and the last image (touching ground) resonates as answer and cost. Motifs (light darkening, raindrop) accrue meaning instead of being declared. Subtext stays active beneath the spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of connection through silence emerges organically from action and image (reversed lullabies, tapping drum, shared vibration). The final cadence reweights music as quietude without overt moralizing, though one line edges declarative (“teaching not notes, but the profound music of quietude”). Subtext works in gesture (Mira’s tears, synchronized rhythm). The piece invites reflection on absence as generative.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of integrity versus institutional corruption and solitude versus complicity arise from particular choices and images (journals, lateral reading, returning the tube). The ending offers a resonant stance rather than a tidy lesson. Slight explicitness in the last line (“integrity bloomed best in seclusion”) edges toward moralizing. Subtext otherwise carries through the layered tranquility motif.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of resurrection, memory, and cost braid through concrete particulars (orchid rebirth, maternal inscriptions, scent blend) and culminate without moralizing. The mother’s line (“Memories are scents we cannot escape”) edges toward explicit statement but is justified diegetically. The closing reprices memory from threat to integrated grief/peace. Subtext operates in the mirrored UV patterns between vial and orchid.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete motifs—rope, strata, patterning—rather than assertion. The final image conceptually reprices “time’s texture” as a braided, frayed endurance rather than a gift to be accepted. Ethical playfulness complicates, not absolves, the choice, avoiding neat moral. The resonance lingers: pursuit over possession, with a visible surrender of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of embracing incompletion emerges organically from action, sound, and ritual, with a strong final image that reweights the world. The explicit vow risks minor overstatement but remains diegetic and earned by tradition. The echoes’ mingling with ambient ruin lands as conceptual repricing rather than a tidy moral. Subtext lives in the choice to accept “becoming” over closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece earns a resonant answer to authenticity versus deception through image and action, not moralizing. The “affectionate detachment” toward her past and the petal’s wilt reprice the premise: elevate, not erase, half truths. Subtext lives in the ledger‑like observations and the calm at the end. It resists neat binaries while still offering clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of “cycles of compassion” emerges through the cargo‑handler memory and the grandfather’s anonymous compositions, but it’s also stated overtly, edging toward moralizing in the final third. The locket and the symphony motif provide concrete vehicles for resonance. Subtext exists in the mutual recognition of quiet work, though declarations sometimes eclipse implication. The ending image is tender but a touch didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communal memory, belonging through art, and ache transformed into strength arise organically from events and images (reeds, tag, arbor). Subtext works through gesture and ritual rather than overt statement, though a few lines verge on thesis (“beyond lost murmurs into enduring connection”). The final image reweights prior motifs effectively. The piece avoids platitudes for the most part, retaining a credible emotional afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of creation, captivity vs. balance, and art’s ambition (illustrating “souls”) align with the echo-source and time-sculpting. The final image reweights prior material: harmony is preserved by adding controlled interruptions, a nuanced stance on order vs. generative noise. No moralizing, though the neatness edges toward tidy. Subtext remains image-led rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (“dovetailing” grief’s fragments; mapping feeling to pattern) arises from particulars rather than commentary, and the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. The glass eyes and mosaic accrue meaning and return charged. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant. A hair more counter‑pressure or irony could deepen complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: preserving hope, caching the self until needed, and memory as a conduit of resilience. The tape reweights the motif at the end without sermonizing, and the final image answers the core question through action rather than moralizing. One line (“the crawl space dweller's motivation was fulfilled”) edges toward explicitness but doesn’t undercut the resonance. Subtext—visibility as care and cost—lingers convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of yielding vs control arises from concrete beats (controlled variables vs storm adaptation) and culminates in her choice. Recurring images (leaf veins, trellis reconstruction) reweight meaning at the end. A few lines edge toward overt moral (“beauty in yielding”), but they are supported by prior dramatization. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance emerges from particulars: convergence of personal and global ruins, story for artifact, art as meaning‑making. Subtext works via image (amber insect, tidal nexus), but one explicit theme sentence (“to thresh meaning not in isolation, but through connection”) dilutes the implicit power. The ending’s emotional aftereffect is honest and earned. Complexity remains, though slightly over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece coherently explores embracing uncertainty and the limits of foresight, with images (overlapping shadows, bright darkness) carrying the thematic load. Occasional explicit statements (“true magic lay in the unknown”) edge toward telling but are supported by scene pressure. The final image reweights earlier material without a tidy moral. Resonance lingers through the redefined sight and its social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of absence, memory, and communal healing emerge organically through the valve, mist, and staged intervals; the ending reweights earlier images without a blunt moral. The “compile fragments into meaning” motif is embodied in her practice and communal labor. A few direct statements (“this valve remembers… compiling our pains into purpose”) skate close to thematic telling. Subtext still carries much of the load through image and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of avoidance versus truth, ritual, and pattern recognition emerge organically from the map/punch/arrows motif. The final stance reweights past avoidance, though the line “bad habits shatter” tips toward declarative moral. Several images (earth‑sky alignment, spectral rails) carry resonance without over‑explaining. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, skepticism, and the ethics of kindness emerge from particulars: the magic square as soul-archive, whales as unheard symphony, alignment as permission rather than command. The ending offers a quiet, resonant answer—clarity without erasure—without sermonizing. The wonder is earned through action rather than declared. A touch of ambiguity around limits might have deepened the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece interrogates “what happens after goodbye” and lands on a non‑literal answer (renewal vs. oblivion) earned through the experience of the breach. Recurring images (light fractures, hushed thunder) accrue thematic weight without overt moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—knowledge comes in “fragments,” tempering boredom rather than banishing it. A hair of direct statement remains, but it doesn’t blunt resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres: equity versus deceit, bureaucracy versus liquefied rigidity, life balanced against legacy. The ink’s property and the funeral home’s liminal space refract the moral calculus in images rather than argument. A few explicit thesis lines (“mathematics of a fair trade”) curb subtlety, but the final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. Resonance lingers in the cost of chosen deceit to preserve justice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of preservation vs containment, ethics of invention, and time as refracted medium arise organically from acts and objects. The mountaineer tale mirrors the labyrinth and reframes the town’s hush without moralizing. The final resolve carries ambiguity and consequence that lingers. A slightly sharper ethical pinch on his decision would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Erased histories and nameless identity accrue through concrete particulars (dockworker’s tale, locket, swallowed village) and reweight at the end. The poison label’s bitterness braided into “salty resilience” gives an earned, non‑didactic resonance. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“nameless identity became a strength”), slightly reducing subtextual charge. Overall, the thematic weave is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring images (compass in sand, fading paint, closing pages) converge to an answer that fits the lived beats. However, the explicit articulation “life’s riddle was to navigate its transience with resilient joy” tips into thematic telling at the end, reducing subtext. Despite that, the conceptual repricing lands and lingers through image. Greater trust in implication would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of community resilience vs. gentrification emerge organically through tactics (graffiti codes, co-ops) and the chip’s symbolic reprise. The dual allegiance adds moral texture without false equivalence, as she bridges factions. The final image offers resonance without moralizing, though a hint of neatness trims complexity. Subtext in performance codes (juggling patterns passing messages) is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—guardianship versus progress eroding quiet—emerges organically from the vigil and final image of dissolution captured at sunrise. Subtext works through the nightwatch motif and the “dawning hush,” reweighted in the last photograph. A few lines edge toward explicit moralizing (“would remind others”), softening subtlety. Still, the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: preservation through witnessing carries both solace and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Repair as moral/aesthetic practice, light reinterpreted through a blind craftsman, and guidance vs. fog cohere without sermonizing. The refraction-as-translation motif deepens meaning and returns in the final image. A few lines edge toward direct statement (“You’ve anchored our hopes”), but the piece largely earns its resonance through image and action. The final calm registers as a reconfiguration, though not a profound repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of origins and convergence is embedded in specific images (rivulet condensation, coordinates, phrasebook bridging human divides). Subtext of personal reckoning quietly threads the departure. The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. A slightly deeper on‑page friction between reverence for legend and pragmatic risk could heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Harmony, community, and balance emerge organically through image and action (fork note, foot cadence, bells realigned). The “wild hush” to “living whisper” shift is a resonant answer to the theme. Occasional direct statements (“greed fractured the town’s soul”) edge toward telling, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the closing image reframes prior motifs without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around memory, silence, and disciplined attention as a counterforce to fear. The perfume‑evoked memories reweight the hush and convert the temple’s “lonesome splendor” into earned poise rather than decoration. The ending resounds without moralizing: charged poise in a solitary triumph that costs time and risk. A hair more ambiguity about what’s sacrificed would deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of truth, inheritance, and earned absolution develop organically through the confessional image and the ghosts’ need for integrated narrative. Recurring motifs (“hush,” “copperlight,” lattice) reweight at the end without moralizing, offering a quiet, resonant answer. A few declarative phrases (“quest for authentic hush”) brush close to thesis-stating but are counterbalanced by strong images. The aftereffect is contemplative rather than pat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Debt, love-as-poison, and healing-with-cost interlock through particulars (toxic blossoms, sapping visits, the final release). The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing; the “mournful elation” paradox accrues meaning. Subtext coheres with the bead as a conduit across lifetimes. Repetition of the theme phrase is a touch on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Broken precedents” move from motif (plate image) to enacted theme (bridge, forbidden garden, altar rebirth). The story resists explicit moralizing; its answer is embodied in communal repair and ritualized craft. A hint of thematic telling (“broken precedents”) slightly blunts subtlety, but the final charged poise—ongoing nights of mending—lingers with reflective weight. The mend-as-worship frame feels coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of interrupted journeys and cyclical restoration thread through concrete images (roots through bones, sundial’s shadow, scrolls on cycles). Subtext works best in the orchard’s life‑amid‑death juxtaposition. A few explicit equivalences (“incomplete, much like her fractured faith”) blunt subtlety. The ending resonates, if slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of futurism longing for the past and “meaning in the margins” emerge through chalk codes versus holograms, with a closing repricing toward analog tactility. Recurring images (chalk dust, golden arches, birds) modulate the idea without over-explaining. A few explicit statements state motives outright, slightly reducing subtext. The final image resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of hidden wisdom, unheard narratives as power, and loyalty disguised as treachery emerge organically from the action and images. The recurring “echoed silence” and the eternal candle accrue meaning without sermonizing. The final charged poise—work completed, hidden, mask resumed—offers a non‑literal answer about the costs of quiet vigilance. Complexity is present, though ambiguity could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of confession, repair, and the peril/mercy of truth emerge through particular images (condensation letters, moonlight healing contingent on honesty). Subtext lives in the spirits’ harmonies and the cathedral shard’s history reweighted as a conduit. Some lines literalize theme (“I should have said I’m sorry”) bordering on overt statement, slightly dulling resonance. The ending image still carries a credible, quiet repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—emerges through actions (deciphering smudges, trading the coral) rather than lecture. The poem “Wounds grow roots, then flowers” risks neatness but is earned by the on-page process and carries a tender charge. Subtext around displacement and shared trauma hums beneath the dialogue. One line (“It’s like our worries—twisted, but beautiful”) edges toward telling but doesn’t derail resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of communal memory and art as illumination emerges organically through the film/fresco/light motifs. The final repricing—that joy is veiled, not lost—reweights prior images without moralizing and leaves a resonant aftertaste. Ambiguity is purposeful and reflective rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of inquiry over certainty, perception, and transformation arise organically via the echo mechanics and nested awakenings. The final answer (“I believe in the magic that questions create”) states the thesis, muting subtext and inviting a thematic‑echo penalty. Still, the recurring object and pattern reweight meaning credibly. The piece leaves a reflective aftertaste even if it edges toward explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of commodified cognition vs. embodied, communal resistance arises organically through coded gardens and insect logic. Subtext operates in images (aphids forming scripts; a gourd that warps surveillance), though occasional aphorism (“we are the storm’s architects”) edges toward slogan. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—revolution planted in living code—but leans a breath declarative in the final line. Thematic complexity is present but could cut deeper into personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—art as alchemy that transforms suffering into durable peace—emerges organically from taktics (singing, armistice, ensconcing) rather than moralizing. Recurring images (nacre, reef-shadow light, postcard, lullabies) shift meaning at the end to embody peace. Slight risk of thematic insistence with repeated phrasing (“photosynthesize pain”) but the final image resounds without tidy sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on endurance and the labor of making beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Memory, extinction, and the poison‑beauty of regret emerge through particulars, not thesis. The scar/replacement image reweights the earlier “deserted marvels” from mausoleum to fragile, ongoing tending. The ending resists a tidy moral: she preserves, but cannot save all, including her “own unspoken dreams.” Subtext hums through object work and silence rather than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of trust, misreading, and the ethics of protective silence emerge through concrete promises (“My silence was a shield, not a sword”). The final image—the ink well dimming as parting looms—carries resonance without overt moralizing. Some thematic statements verge on declarative rather than subtextual, slightly limiting depth. Still, the piece elicits a clean aftereffect of earned reconciliation shadowed by separation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of balance, stewardship, and “measured mercy” cohere through the chain and adhesive code. However, Mira’s explicit plea (“Preserve the heart…”) tips toward moral statement over subtext. The ending’s harmony is tidy, with limited ambiguity or lingering cost. Resonance arises from images more than discovery under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of preservation vs. sharing and reinvention vs. truth are earned through recurring, reweighted images (motes into constellations; paper trails; the meteorite as fragment with purpose). The final cadence reframes his mission without moralizing. Subtext works in the choice of what message to send and in the tactile rituals that both soothe and imprison.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece cohesively develops the theme of thresholds and “necessary distances,” culminating in a resonant reframing. However, the final articulation (“sacredness arose from the hush before crossing”) edges into thematic statement, dulling subtext. Imagery (logbook codes, mazes, storm fronts) earns much of the insight through particulars. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic throughline—belonging as attunement, bridging worlds—is earned via concrete ritual, not stated moral. Recurring light motifs (bioluminescence, “fireflies”) reweight in the final image to answer the longing. Slight risk of sentimentality in the ease of acceptance, but the imagery-led resolution feels honest and resonant. The feather’s refigured state provides an embodied thematic seal.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres—loss, possibility, and preservation—through recurring particulars (foam, seeds, runes, map). The final insight reweights prior images, but one line (“not from malice, but from the natural drift of time and choice”) edges into stated thesis. Subtext otherwise lives in image and method. Emotional aftereffect is tender and bittersweet without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ordering randomness to serenade monotony emerges through concrete beats (bishop placement, timed musician, wind-as-partner). Thematically coherent images recur and reweight at the end (pocketing the bishop; the charged lull closing). Some thematic lines are told outright (“His motivation was simple yet profound”), shaving subtlety. Still, the aftertaste is honest and earned without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Memory versus ban, exile as canvas, and transformation through chosen constraints cohere and culminate in the monument image. The “gaps” motif becomes a metaphoric ethics of attention that reweights the world. A slight slip toward declarative theme in the final line (“the nostalgia ban would crumble”) trims subtlety. Still, resonance lingers through image more than slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of attention, value in the mundane, and transformation via perception emerge organically from the craft and ritual. Subtext is strong in the refracted light motif and the atrium’s charged reprise. However, the line “one must cherish the mundane” veers into explicit moralizing, slightly flattening resonance at the peak. The ending still offers a resonant image‑answer, but with some told wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance arises from the cracked porcelain/stars motif, culminating in the “lighter” box and dawn—clean, if familiar. However, explicit thesis lines (“Pain isn’t just destruction… It’s a teacher”) tilt toward moralizing and flatten subtext. The piece moves the reader, but insight is sometimes told rather than earned purely through action and image. Thematic complexity is present but not fully resisted from neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Hope-as-engineerable system emerges through concrete motifs (gauge, balloons, fractal mandalas) rather than pure assertion, and the final “calculus” image reweights the premise. Some lines verge on thematic telling (“hope equaled the sum of tested variables”), skimming didactic. Still, the serene upheaval frame invites reflection and lands a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity survives in the ethical scale of intervening across timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of legacy, denial, and redemptive re‑mapping emerge through objects and images (echoes, charred diaries, inverted negatives) rather than lecturing. The mirror between Silas’s burden and Elara’s reframing carries strong resonance. The ending edges toward declarative (“chart not just echoes, but redemptions”), but the image base mostly earns it. Subtext of complicity and listening as care lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through action: art bending truth toward possibility at personal cost. Recurring images (prism, echoes, borrowed heartbeat) reweight at the end when the mirrors “show a world remade.” No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers around whether this grace is ethical or sustainable. The resonance is earned and avoids neat moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of redemption’s cost and “flawed beauty” recur through image (runes, imperfect sky) and the binding of life-force to treaty. Resonance is tangible at the ending, but some lines state theme directly (“promising a flawed but beautiful peace”), reducing subtext. The clipboard-as-relic nicely marries word to deed. The piece invites reflection on means vs. ends without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of complicity and atonement emerges from concrete acts; “fractured grace” refracts through setting and final rain. The egg’s echo reweights his philanthropy, exposing its hypocrisy while preserving what was lost. No tidy absolution—profit loss and exposure remain—yet the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. One line edges toward declarative (“Your song will not fade...”) but remains character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—resistance to soporific tradition—emerges through concrete acts (untangling bound voices) rather than moralizing. The “harvest of echoes” reframes history as tool and obligation, and the final swirl reweights the lullaby as shattering. Ambiguity remains about consequences, keeping resonance alive. No sermonizing undercuts the image‑led finish.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of truth versus fabrication arises organically from the calligrapher’s craft and the reversal ritualized through puppetry. Recurring “half‑lit epiphanies” and the meteor hush reweight the final image. Several sentences state the thesis too directly (“ethical explorations”), blunting subtext. Still, the closing cadence offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motifs (knot, wing, cadence, ephemeral architecture) cohere into a meditation on memorializing absence and the dignity of the unfinished. The final acceptance that “some harmonies resolve only in silence” reweights prior images. A touch of explicitness (“esoteric truth”) slightly blunts subtext. Overall resonance is earned through particulars, not sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of heritage, memory preservation, and self‑forgiveness emerge through concrete images (punched card as names; rope as voice‑binder). The final image reweights all motifs without overt moralizing. A couple of lines verge on tidy declarations (“ensuring the names would echo eternally”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Subtext largely lives in the labor and tools, not speeches.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of destiny as an ecology—old directives decaying to make room for new paths—emerges organically from the directive’s state and dream images. The final shift reweights prior material without a blunt moral, though the line “To transcend is to understand why we select” edges toward explicit thesis. Recurring motifs (vines, seal, decay) accrue meaning and refresh in the end. Resonance is strong if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of faith vs empiricism, devotion encrypted as science, and liminal governance accrue through motifs and actions. Subtext is present in the concealment of ritual and in the sages’ approval. The final paragraph edges toward telling (“the ironic truth…”) rather than letting the image alone reweight meaning. Still, the covenant as earned stasis resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of forgiveness/adaptation emerges through specific images (vibrations, cellular recall, shifting walls). Subtext largely works in gesture and ritual, but the final line states the moral overtly, muting resonance. The pin’s reprise provides a credible thematic vessel. Ambiguity/pushback on the ease of letting go is limited, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: broken instruments can reveal hidden truths; boundaries dissolve through embodied unity; grief transfigures craft. Recurring images (fog, frost, glass, sextant) reweight at the end without moralizing. Slight sentimentality in the sealed success, but the final bridge image carries earned resonance. Subtext of making-as-mourning accumulates through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from particulars: vows as seasonal, wisdom arriving via mishap, objects holding promises. The ribbon’s reweighting and the poem’s wind‑caught reveal tie image to idea without over‑explaining. One aphoristic line risks neatness, but the cost of acceptance keeps sentiment in check. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through the fused quartz‑silk artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of nonlinear inheritance and the price of forbidden knowledge emerges through objects and action (cameo, mirror chorus, cracks). The “between the first and last page” motif reweights the world’s rules effectively. A few lines risk on-the-nose statement (“Because knowledge blooms…”) but the ending resists moralizing and leaves charged ambiguity. Resonance carries beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of knowledge ethics, gaps as leverage, and growth demanding dissemination integrate through concrete actions (researching omissions, floral scripts) rather than sermonizing. The “unheard symphony” motif threads meaning and returns in the final image, though a few lines verge on tidy uplift. The revised vow carries conceptual cost, keeping the ending from pure triumphalism. Resonance is present if not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Identity, naming, and reunion cohere through recurring images (garden, swatch, fog) that reweight at the end. The “unkindled solace” evolving to “blazing comfort” offers a clean thematic turn without a moral. Occasional direct statements (“blissfully aberrant”) nibble at subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of turning absence into presence emerges organically via rope/clock/seal synthesis. The final image reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext about archival authority and the ethics of restoration glimmers but isn’t sharpened by consequence. Resonance is clean but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—peace as forged, not fragile—emerges through the craft sequence and the “bloom of hush” rather than mere assertion. One line edges toward thesis clarity (“true peace wasn’t fragile silence but a hammered repose”), but the final image reweights prior particulars effectively. The internal landscape realization aligns with action. Ambiguity persists in scale and consequence without muddying meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Images (hush, wind, thistles, beacon) align with the theme of imposed order vs. chaos, culminating in a reweighted final image. However, the explicit thesis statement—“coincidences were illusions”—tilts toward moralizing and reduces subtext. The shard of hush elegantly embodies the theme without explanation, suggesting the piece could trust its imagery more. Resonance is present but a bit declared.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of collective memory, erasure, and identity forged under isolation emerge organically from action (shadow readings, whispered fragments, inscribing a new narrative). Subtext around chosen forgetting and facades of harmony is handled through image (elongated, twisted shadows) rather than moralizing. The final reconfiguration meaningfully answers the central question: bridging past and future at a cost. A hair more ambiguity about what is sacrificed would deepen the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of creation as defiance and hope as practiced play arise organically from image and action. However, the spelled‑out mosaic lines (“Defy the weight…”) and the final chant edge into on‑the‑nose moralizing, dulling subtext. The closing image still resonates as a repricing of darkness’s “hush.” Ambiguity is limited but present in the ritual’s danger and risk of sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motifs (tide, pool, cicada, withdrawal/replenishment) braid into a clear meditation on transition and rebirth without heavy authorial intrusion. Subtext operates through gesture and method—the tangential reading as a way to face change obliquely. The line “Transitions are like tides” edges toward the on-the-nose. Even so, the final image reweights the night and avoids moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silence as nourishment earned through voluntary constraint deepens into a paradox: isolation cultivates expansiveness. The doll, gilded hush, and inversion recast fear into practiced openness without moralizing. The final act of sipping the essences reframes the bunker as a canvas rather than a cage, a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity persists (father’s oblivious hammering remains), keeping the ending from neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: silence as presence rather than void, grief re‑tuned through attention, the vial translating inner weather. The storm glass gains reweighted meaning at the end, shifting from gauge to mirror of healing. Explanations (“in stillness, it clarified, revealing beauty in order”) flirt with didactic but remain anchored in concrete action. The final hush sustains resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—fusing past and future, restorative stewardship—emerges through actions (scholar’s method, quantum daring) rather than explicit moralizing. Futuristic nostalgia recurs and reweights the ending as the city “awakens to a renewed harmony.” The resolution trends tidy, with limited ambiguity or counter‑pressure. Still, images like data‑mist paint and circuit‑veined crystal give thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of boundary, breath, and compassionate cutting accumulate through motifs (thresholds, scars, emptiness) and culminate in a resonant repricing of “space to inhale.” One line leans declarative—“this loaded emptiness is not punishment; it’s space to inhale”—but most meaning arises from image and action. The final image reweights earlier material without a moral summary. Complexity remains, with room for more subtextual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic throughline—alchemizing trauma into communal wealth—emerges from particulars (pressure → diamonds; vow materialized). The “quantum promise” reframes commitment across selves in a way that resonates with recovery and mutual aid. Some lines tip toward stated thesis (“Translate this into diamonds”) rather than earning it solely via image. Still, the final sharing image carries genuine, if tidy, resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of inheritance, complicity, and intuition versus mechanism emerge through actions and images rather than thesis. The final image reframes the father’s intent and the lineage with satisfying resonance. Occasional on-the-nose lines (“he was the dynasty ender not by chance, but by design”) slightly flatten subtext. Overall, the ending’s quiet refusal avoids sermonizing and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strings, patterns, allegiance, and guardianship interweave into a theme of chosen bondage as pathway to possibility. The puppetry motif reweights fate and agency in the final binding, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. A few abstract labels (“shape of possibility”) lean expository, but image-work does the thematic lifting. The orchard’s response grounds the epiphany in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of kindness persisting across time and history as a conduit for healing arise organically from particulars (dust trails, Quaker home, button). The button’s reprised meaning avoids overt didacticism, though the parallel to the ex’s apology edges close to telling. The final act of digitizing functions as a thematic answer: preservation as care. The resonance lingers without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of apathy vs. memory and “coded freedom” emerge through the puddle‑map, defunct booth, and resurrected broadcasts. Some thematic language is overt (“tyranny of indifference”), edging toward thesis over subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs without a tidy moral, offering resonance as whispers ignite action. Complexity is present but could deepen with less direct labeling and more conflicted embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence-as-agency, absence as presence, and the ethics of suppressing fate cohere through image and act. Recurring motifs (dew, prisms, negative space) reweight at the end without moralizing. The eerie nostalgia infuses the cost and preserves ambiguity (peace secured, loneliness deepened). Thematic range is focused rather than multifaceted, but resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of remembrance as access to wisdom and renewal emerge organically through the monuments and the Leaf Whisperer’s gratitude. The final brightening reweights earlier “mossy delight” with communal consequence. Ambiguity is modest—the piece favors uplift over tension—yet the ritualized honoring of the forgotten carries coherent resonance. No overt moralizing undercuts the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—befriending uncertainty—emerges through image and tactic, but is also stated outright twice, blunting subtext. The compass rose reweights meaning (from navigation to living with flux), a strong symbolic engine. The ending resonates but leans into moralizing diction (“profoundly certain in its uncertainty”). More implication, less declaration, would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of repair, naming, and hubris-to-humility are woven through kintsugi practice and the final reweighting of “Aurora.” The recurring coin and gold seams support subtext rather than mere symbol. Some lines verge on thesis-stating (“to understand the weight of names”), but the closing image re-answers them with action. Resonance is solid though a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of guilt, confession, and joy-as-healing are integrated through the harp’s modulation and the tooth’s transformation, not just stated. “The ache is luminous” edges toward thesis‑speak but is supported by image and action. The final release reweights prior images without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains modest but present in the mingled sorrow/joy texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The thematic weave of mercy, guilt, and shared humanity emerges through image and ordeal, with the pewter strap and UV “penance” doing real work. However, the explicit statement “forgiveness equaled pain divided by time...” functions as a thesis and dulls subtext in the final paragraph. The story earns the insight but states it too nakedly. A quieter final image could have preserved ambiguity and increased resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Memory, erasure, and restorative witnessing are threaded through concrete images (figures breathing in the seascape, names revealed). “Anchors of intuition” operates thematically and tactically, which helps avoid sermonizing. A few lines flirt with thesis-speak (“She had unfastened the past not with force...”), slightly flattening subtext. The final image of voices woven into air resonates and reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs—ceilings, cracks in façades, the mainspring’s illusion of immortality—cohere into a meditation on control, containment, and release. The final image reweights earlier details (burden lifting as ghosts ascend through cracks). A brief lore paragraph edges toward exposition but still serves theme. Resonance lingers without a stated moral, though ambiguity about personal cost could be richer.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grief, perfection versus necessary flaw, and the ethics of breaking a system to gain love are woven through image and action. The printed line “Eternity bends, the moment claims all” risks on-the-nose but is integrated as an act, not a thesis. The ending offers a resonant repricing: he holds a fragment and accepts an imperfect world altered by his hand. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of spectacle masking oppression, the ethics of historiography, and redeemed failure arise from concrete acts (sanctuary‑making, deciphering, reframing). The final image—shard as talisman—reweights prior opulence as elegy. A few overt assertions (“This would settle the archaeological dispute…”) skim toward thesis‑telling, slightly dulling subtext. Still, resonance lingers with plausible ambiguity about truth and propaganda.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Truth vs. deceit and “mending what isn’t torn” emerge through concrete images (wilting ferns, rust transmuted to resolve) rather than moralizing. The “covenant of rust” motif reweights at the end as renewed promise, harmonizing theme and plot. Subtext about integrity as technique (not force) lands. The clarity borders on tidy, but it avoids sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of silence after industry, memory-as-scent, and the limits of explanation accumulate into a credible repricing of “eccentricity as sensibility.” The explorers’ “transcendence” adds an elegant counterpoint to loss, though the line “Here, explanations failed” states what the imagery already shows. The final hush and secret carried within resonate, if softly. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of rekindled alliances, stewardship, and simplicity carrying complexity emerge through the slide’s images and the layered carving method. At times the narrative states theme directly (“not mere historical footnotes”), softening subtext. Still, the final image of a resilient sculpture animated by projections provides a resonant non‑literal answer. The piece invites reflection on continuity across eras without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of resilience, hidden beauty, and lineage transmit well through recurring images (night blooms, thaw, glass). However, the thesis is stated outright in the final revelation—“Flowers bloom at night to teach us…”—tipping into moralizing and reducing subtext. Despite that, the closing image of her mural and framed postcards sustains resonance. The piece invites reflection but prefers articulation over implication at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant themes of solidarity vs. survival and the price of truth accrue through images (obsidian sheen, blood in sand) and the absolution bargain. Some thematic statements (“FEAR DIVIDED US,” “FORGIVE TO FREE”) verge on declarative, tempering subtlety. Still, the final image reweights the past and present with earned gravity. The moral calculus reads complex, not pat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—rejecting illusion for communal labor—emerges through the bottle/lantern counterpoint and the final real flame. Occasional didactic lines (“No more reliance on wishes”) flatten subtext. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer via action, not moral statement. Greater ambiguity about risk or relapse could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of language as conduit, memory as technology, and unease transmuted into renewal emerge from concrete particulars (wax grooves, dead tongues, rooftop soil). The ending offers a non‑literal answer—silence catalyzes change; archiving can reshape reality—without moralizing. Subtext around obsolescence and purpose is earned and lingers. Minor summarizing in the aftermath slightly thins the final emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Order versus entropy, inheritance, and the tactility of time braid into images rather than platitudes, culminating in “seeds of time to plant.” The phoenix, oak, frost, and vortex cross‑signal a coherent meditation on stewarding possibility. The resonance is earned, though the articulation of motive appears a bit declarative early. A hint more friction between want and cost would deepen the afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of listening over noise emerges organically through tactics and final image (coiling the rope). Subtext lives in the solstice hush versus siren clamor. A closing sentence edges toward stating a moral, slightly flattening resonance. Nonetheless, the scene invites reflection on attention, humility, and risk without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Recurring images (falling stars, hush, the yellow glass) carry the theme toward a resonant, quiet answer. However, explicit thesis‑like lines (“Her motivation crystallized—to find strength in vulnerability…”) reduce subtext, especially late. The story still invites reflection through image‑driven communion rather than moralizing. Ambiguity around “guardian of vulnerabilities” lands warmly without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of silence, covenant, and preservation emerge organically through image (bees/flowers, stained glass, hum/ghosts) rather than thesis. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing—unspoken words preserved “like honey in a comb.” Subtext operates through gesture and light rather than declaration. Complexity persists, with love’s burden honored and accepted rather than explained away.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rich thematic weave: time as commodity and texture, memory as currency, grief canalized through the urn’s ashes. The garage-sale barter idiom deftly refracts value and exchange. A small ding for on-the-nose phrasing (“She had rediscovered the essence”), which slightly explains what the images already convey. The ending’s commitment to share understanding offers a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (beauty in the incomplete; art as harmonization) emerges organically through object/action rather than moralizing. The feather as “missing word” and the drake’s scarred ascent reframe incompletion as radiance with cost. Subtext works through image and rhythm, not thesis. The ending resonates without neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mortality and interspecies kinship arise from concrete acts—the copper spirals, sap‑rhythm crystals—culminating in a legacy image. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (“urging harmony in a world often blind to it”) blunt subtext. The final cadence reweights the premise without a moral lecture, though risk and ambiguity are modest. Resonance lingers primarily through image rather than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of return, integration, and engineered ritual interlock through particulars (footprints, relics of homecomings on statues, amber neurochemistry). The final repricing—“convergence wasn’t forced but inevitable”—resonates without moralizing, recasting both artificial and authentic pilgrimages. Motifs recur with escalating meaning (bronze quiet, rain, glow) and avoid didactic closure. The amber’s biochemical echo grounds abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of renewal, language as bridge, and a broken pact restored emerge through image and action rather than moralizing; the sea’s final “sigh” and the birds’ silence resonate. “Submerged concord” integrates concept and outcome with a quiet, non‑literal answer. A few lines lean declarative (“His motivation burned...” “the core concept of submerged concord”), but they don’t swamp the subtext. The aftereffect is contemplative and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around distance vs. closeness and how revelation is colored by memory and bias; the riddle’s line and “tinted revelations” motif meaningfully reweight the quest. The leaf’s reprise (as the brother’s talisman) reframes hope with ambiguity. Occasional explicit statements (“to translate distance into closeness”) risk over-articulation but remain integrated. The final step into risk offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Heritage, “true north,” and echoed silence braid into a coherent theme of self‑direction born from alienation. The family custom meaningfully reframes the cosmos as soul‑map; the final image reweights pariahhood as strength without sermonizing. Occasional direct statements (“turning confusion into exploration”) edge toward telling but do not undercut resonance. The ending invites reflection with a clean, image‑led answer.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of amendment versus domination and play as sacred practice emerge through acted particulars (swapping tainted pieces for “wonder’s lore”). Some thematic statements verge on telling (“I amend not to steal your game, but to restore its sacred play”), but they fit the fable‑like register. The final image (spire warming, people whispering) offers a resonant answer: balance through playful humility. Complexity is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Symbols (pawnless board, small gestures, interregnum) align to explore overlooked agency and the ethics of will used for benevolence. The final pawn flicker reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer: liberation of the small is a victory of attention enforced by will. Occasional nomenclature (“benevolently ruthless”) risks thesis‑labeling, but the scene mostly earns its insights through action and image. Ambiguity remains purposeful (shadow as eater of gestures) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of home as relational shape and the ethics of remembering versus forgetting emerge from concrete acts (feather’s texture unlocking language; orb breaking). The final image reprices the premise without a tidy moral, though a few lines state theme outright (“Home wasn’t a place...”). The “hidden thunder” motif meaningfully evolves from suppression to ally. Resonance lingers, if slightly declared at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of self-forgiveness and humility emerges through specific images (winnowing, frayed border, labyrinth alignment) rather than moralizing. The final image reweights prior motifs without stating a thesis outright, though “forgiving the young tutor he once was” edges toward explicitness. Subtext coheres: decoding the world is decoding the self. Resonance lingers via the charged object and restored time.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of forgiveness‑as‑refraction is integrated through recurring images and the spire’s response, but several lines verge on thesis statements (“To forgive is to fracture the heart’s hard stone,” “the price is the self”). The final declaration of freedom flirts with moralizing. Still, the closing image reweights prior material without neat absolution of consequences. Resonance lingers, but subtlety wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The kintsugi motif integrates action and theme, turning flaws into strength in both statue and self. The mentor’s deathbed and failed transmutation memories reweight the ritual with meaning. However, a few explicit thematic statements flatten subtext (“repair…fabric of his own existence”). The final image resonates but leans close to stated moral rather than implication.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of nostalgia as chain versus presence are integrated through concrete images (cracked mirror, shell projection, “temporary eternity”). However, the line that states the thesis (“his nostalgia was a chain, and freedom lay...”) edges into explicit moralizing and blunts subtext. The closing reconfiguration resonates, but a slightly quieter articulation would deepen ambiguity. Symbolic motifs largely earn their keep rather than serving as tokens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme—subtlety/whispered intent over brute force—is enacted through the ritual and the silent scent‑beckoning, and the ending image reaffirms it. However, it’s also stated outright several times, edging toward didactic (“whispers indeed traveled farther”). Subtext hums in the scent motif and the purified grief, but moral complexity is limited. The resonance lingers, if somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Reverse migration” and “geography of loss” recur as enacted motifs—the censer foot, sea glass lens, and midnight calls transmute metaphor into mechanism. The ending reweights the premise by making the station a beacon for others, not just self‑repair. A few lines flirt with declarative theme (“Reverse migration wasn’t about…”), mildly flattening subtext. Still, the final image carries earned, unsentimental resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth vs. occlusion, rationality vs. superstition, and safety amidst contagious empathy emerge organically through action and object choice. The final assertion (“safety not through lies, but through honest occlusion”) skirts on-the-nose moralizing, reducing subtextual power. Still, the glass eye and storms provide resonant images that refract the idea of shielding without total didacticism. Ambiguity about the ritual’s “real” efficacy invites some reflective aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Witnessed isolation, memory as stewardship, and the ethics of omission versus revelation converge through image rather than sermon. The Edelweiss reframes from token of love to burden of remembrance, reweighting prior moments. Thematic throughline of “gaps” is enacted, not declared. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Meaning accrues through particulars (ants as cartographers, maps, foundry chip) to an ending that reweights the premise: honoring a promise by seeking, not clinging. No sermonizing; the vision functions as image‑led repricing of his life. Slight neatness in the “releasing him” nod trims ambiguity, but resonance lingers via the return to map work “with fresh eyes.” The refrain “as the creek rises” deepens the mortality/choice motif.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of power, deception, and the peril of revelation emerge through recurrent images (bleeding starlight) and choices rather than moralizing. The lure vs truth tension culminates in a repricing of the “final warning” without overt thesis. Lir’s line “it’s a trap” veers toward on‑the‑nose, trimming subtext. The ending image lingers with charged ambiguity about redemption vs destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of presence, return/transformation, and revaluation accrue through recurrent images (spiral, ember, pocket‑sun) and culminate in a resonant reweighting. The final offer crystallizes idea into action without moralizing, though the line “Our friendship was the shell” edges toward explicit thesis. Subtext in risk vs. preservation works, if softened by the assured outcome. Overall, the motif‑net supports the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of mortality, authorship, and envy integrate through recurring images (scroll, cliff, flight, grave). The final turn reframes death as material for narrative, but a sentence like “death was just another chapter to chronicle” overstates the thesis, dulling subtext. Still, the braid of envy → harnessing → inscription yields a resonant aftertaste. More implication, less declaration, would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The motifs (flow, occlusion, rebirth) braid elegantly, and the screw’s reprise reweights the ordinary as miraculous. Subtext operates in gesture (hand on belly, fogged window), yielding a resonant final cadence. However, the explicit thematic articulation (“I’ve learned to see miracles in the ordinary”) edges toward moralizing, slightly dulling the afterglow. The piece still invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—turning scars into story as power—emerges through concrete acts (etching runes from superstition, tea as memory medium) rather than abstract claims. Recurring images (breath, storm, feather) reweight at the end as armor-as-story. A faint whiff of explicit uplift (“rewrite their destiny”) trims edge, but the imagery mostly carries the resonance. The final poise against thunder feels earned and not didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “imperfect miracle” motif accrues meaning through the leaky vase, fragile currents, and doomed orchard, culminating in a stance that accepts scarred mending. Subtext surfaces in the sister’s line (“mine you planted yourself”), indicting Elara without didacticism. A slight thematic overstatement appears in the final paragraph about her columns’ new tone, trimming subtlety. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unity vs. separation coheres through recurring images (spiral, mirrors, dictionary) and culminates in a reprise that reweights prior material. Some lines veer toward thesis (“all separations were illusions”), slightly flattening subtext. The theme emerges more from pattern than conflict, yet the final hush resonates. It’s thoughtful and consistent, if a bit declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres through particulars (water, edges, inversion) and culminates in a conceptual repricing of “time” as “cuts/soul’s horizon.” Recurring images (whistle, quiet, ritual counting, razor edges) deepen and reweight in the end. The final statement skirts direct thesis‑speak but is earned by the experiential build. The ambiguity feels purposeful, lingering without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    The permeable‑membrane/letting‑go metaphor is coherently threaded and reweighted at the end. Subtext surfaces in the parallel between spores and people, and the name exchange lands as a quiet answer. However, explicit thesis statements (“letting go was a force, not a void”) verge on moralizing, blunting resonance. Greater reliance on image over declaration would deepen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—responsible openness to chance—emerges through the lantern’s “contained and wild” image and her father’s cautionary role. However, the prose sometimes states the thesis (“to widen perspectives responsibly”) rather than letting subtext carry it, especially in the final vow paragraph. The final mica talisman helps resonance despite mild moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of estrangement as pedagogy, endings as beginnings, and engineered serendipity emerge organically through action and motif, with the harmonica’s “haunted” timbre refracting fate and chance. The inward loop reweights the premise, suggesting the teacher must accept his own prescription. A few lines edge toward explicitness (“This wrong number taught me…”), trimming subtext’s power. Overall, resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of cherishing the ephemeral is enacted through concrete ritual rather than stated moral, culminating in a reweighted bond that lives with cost. Recurring images (walnut ink, locket, twilight) shift meaning at the end without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on memory’s materiality and the ethics of summoning the past. Occasional explicit framing (“proximate causes,” “context changes”) skims close to concept‑speak but doesn’t undercut resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres: connection is manufactured through reciprocal story-making, not fetishized artifacts. The rumor chain as mechanism embodies the idea that shared fictions bind. One sentence (“the cure wasn’t in the rock alone”) tilts toward explicitness, slightly blunting subtext. The final dispersal-with-connection image lands a felt, unsentimental resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silence as healing and language‑through‑skin create a compelling thematic braid; the stillpoint reframes noise into solace. The closing image offers an implicit answer without moralizing, though lines like “core concept he sought” and “transformed grief into acceptance” lean toward telling. Subtext lives in how sound becomes map and then quiet. Resonance lingers even if the arc feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of revision vs erasure and learning from error recur through pen, seeds, and “contingent relationships.” The ending reweights prior material toward “edit to learn,” but several lines state theme directly (“not to forget, but to learn”), blunting subtext. Still, the image of probability drawn as ink and the nib unbending carry resonant implication. Ambiguity exists but is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars: sign language, the empty camera, and mapped intervals coalesce into translating absence into presence. Subtextually, communication beyond voice (signs/whisper) mirrors making silence audible. Occasional explicit statements (“translate silence into music”) skim close to thesis, but the final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. The lingering ambiguity of Thorne’s departure deepens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Destruction vs preservation, love as an ethical fire, and heritage safeguarded from tyranny resonate through concrete images. The ending reweights his past arson without sermonizing, though “It spoke of the civilization’s final vow” edges toward explicitness. The recurring art objects carry subtext cleanly. Emotional aftereffect lingers as duty transformed by grief.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of grief/hope, autonomy versus institutional “progress,” and the ethics of shared consciousness emerge through image and action, not thesis. The recurring auroral/sound motifs reweight at the end into “hopeful lament,” avoiding neat closure. The ambiguity—“him or echo”—lands as earned complexity. A few declarative lines about the scientists flirt with telling but don’t dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme integrates with particulars (whispers vs. shouts; storm nullifies brute control), but the thesis is articulated overtly more than once. The final line states the moral (“proven his truth...”), triggering a thematic echo penalty and reducing subtext. The zodiac flips (Libra → Scorpio) offer a nice, implicit reweighting that could stand alone. Strong images risk being overshadowed by explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Light versus darkness, forgiveness versus betrayal, and “silent empathy” are integrated through image and action. However, the line “to teach darkness the value of stars” states the thesis overtly, edging toward moralizing where subtext already suffices. The final star‑mirroring image is resonant and reweights prior details without needing the articulation. Emotional aftereffect is sincere, not saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres—choice versus predestination, power of quiet collective doubt—with the chess and reflection motifs earning resonance in the ending. Some lines tip toward explicit moralizing (“a prophecy of their own—one of choice, not predestination”), which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the humble tactics and charged quiet let the meaning emerge through image. The last dawn beat reweights prior material without didactic overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of freedom versus imposed serenity and love’s letting-go emerge through particulars (combative tenderness, talisman unlocking guarded hearts) rather than moralizing. The final repricing—wild peace beyond calm—reweights the premise of “violence impossible” without sermon. Subtext in their dialogue and objects carries meaning. Slightly on-the-nose phrasing recurs, but resonance remains.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of enforced joy versus honest grief is embodied through the absurd performance that makes mourning bearable without overt moralizing. The bouquet’s “renewal” reframes loss as endurance, and the turbines’ hush recurs as social control and inner quiet. Ambiguity is maintained—he helps and harms—without false equivalence. The final image reweights prior beats with a resonant, unsentimental answer: survival as charged complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of boundary, language as act, and “trembling certainty” emerge through concrete acts (paraphrase changing the hum) rather than exposition. Recurring images (lantern‑moth hush, clouds, hum) reweight meaning at the end as invitation replaces interdiction. A slight whiff of thesis statement appears in the closing couplet, but it’s cushioned by scene texture. Ambiguity persists productively around the ethical cost of dissolving the “sacred.”

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of embracing flawed grace emerges organically through the barter and renunciation, with images (cracks, wilted petals) accruing meaning. The final acceptance reweights “awakening” without sermonizing. One line (“the beauty he sought lay not in perfection’s illusion…”) edges toward explicit thesis, trimming some subtlety. Overall resonance remains strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete inquiry (connection’s loudness, solitude’s resonance, disconnection’s permanence) rather than moralizing, and the final image reweights prior motifs. A touch of explicit articulation (“texture of connection”) edges toward thesis, but the bell/lens/shadow triad keeps it embodied. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that lingers. Subtext rides the refracted soundscape, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring images (hair lockets, vellum map, origami coordinates, curtains) cohere around grief transmuted into renewal, and the final embedding of vellum reweights “artificial” into authentic reblooming. Occasional on-the-nose lines (“You’ve come to learn how the withered blooms again”) blunt the subtext. Nonetheless, the ending’s quiet endurance and passed-on hope produce a resonant aftereffect. Complexity is present, if not deeply ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Responsibility versus pattern-driven greed resonates through the inherited mystery and the tape’s function; the ending reweights lineage and redemption quietly. Some thematic articulation is on-the-nose (“This is reverse engineering at its essence”), reducing subtext. Still, the object-driven repricing and cultural mapping give the theme specificity beyond platitude. The final image avoids a sermon while hinting at ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of forbidden knowledge, the cost of truth, and the irretrievability of innocence emerge through image and action rather than moralizing. Recurring images (veil, atoms, prisms) shift meaning by the end, landing a resonant, non-literal answer. A few phrases trend abstract, but the final embrace of “beautiful ache” earns its weight. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of hope transmuted through acknowledged regret emerges through concrete images (petals “in luminous regret,” the binding to stone) rather than moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer: preserve hope by integrating the unbound parts, not erasing them. Ambiguity remains human and charged without confusion. No sermonizing undercuts it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The adaptation motif (chameleon, tail tip, color‑shift) evolves meaningfully to answer the central question about balancing care with vigilance. The final image reweights the earlier details without resorting to a spelled‑out moral. Some thematic phrasing leans declarative (“He wouldn’t stop helping animals or people”), softening subtext. Overall, resonance lingers through the object reprise and dawn cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres around the paradox that closure requires embracing, not sealing, wounds; the final realization reweights earlier images (rings, roots, scars). Resonance arises from particulars (roots tunneling, reverse sand) more than abstraction. However, the closing articulation edges toward explicit moralizing (“true closure came not from sealing…”) which trims subtlety. The piece still leaves a lingering, honest aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory as archive and love as stored energy emerge organically from film mechanics and the booth’s function. Recurring images (forgotten lyrics finding tune, hushed thunder) accrue resonance and pay off in the charged quiet finale. A slight tendency to articulate the insight (“unused love wasn’t lost…”) blunts some subtext. Overall, the ending reweights prior particulars without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Remembered stardust” integrates concept and theme, reweighting selfhood and creativity without reducing to a moral. The imagery-driven answer—reconnection to cosmic origins—feels genuinely tied to action. Some thematic articulation edges toward the explicit (“This remembrance… was the key”), slightly flattening subtext. The closing image resonates and invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of vigilance, cultivation, and probabilistic hope emerge through particular images—the dunes’ blossoms, the Archive’s echoes, the clock’s resumed tick—without overt moralizing. The “fractured lullaby” motif threads action, not just tone, and the final image reweights the premise with earned resonance. A few declaratives (“He knew what must be done”) edge toward telling, but they don’t derail subtext. The ambiguity of cost versus renewal lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around “probable miracles” and the braid of intuition/technology, delivered through concrete acts (listening, attunement) rather than moralizing. The gear’s hum recurs as an idea made tactile, reweighted when it falls silent at the end. A hint of on-the-nose phrasing (“core concept,” “auditory key”) slightly flattens subtext. Overall resonance lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of patience, indirectness, and courage awakening accrue through recurring images (leash, star stamp, lullaby, vigil) and culminate in the ferry crossing. One line states the thesis explicitly (“You seek what lies unused within”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier motifs convincingly. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of silence, guilt, and redemption emerge organically through images (bolt, snow, choir). Strong resonance at the end, but lines like “true safety demanded the risk of sound” border on moralizing and undercut subtext. Still, the bolt’s repricing of “safety” is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of truth slowly eroding illusion is embodied by the “rune of drift” and the library’s graceful decay; the final image of vigilant endurance reweights the cycle. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (ink, runes, constellations) rather than assertions. The piece invites reflection on power, legitimacy, and time’s solvent. Limited internal ambivalence restrains a deeper thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cycles that are “periodically eternal,” submerged routes, and atonement braid into a coherent meditation on consequence and redemption. The father’s hidden indentations refract denial into legacy, reweighting the world’s belated penance without sermonizing. The final tapping shifts from inquiry to affirmation, offering a non‑literal answer to the central question. A couple phrases flirt with overt statement, but the images carry the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of meaning‑making amid ruin and “lull as gathering storm” arise organically through images (bare feet, antique glasses, buried circle). The line “She understood now: the lull was not defeat but a gathering storm” overstates what the scene already shows. The ending image resonates but edges toward neat uplift rather than complex repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of evolving tradition and engineered fate integrate with image systems (plants’ whispers, hot springs, amber). Some lines state the thesis too baldly (“to evolve tradition with intent”), trimming subtext. The final image reweights the premise toward hope with a conceptual cost to social order. It resonates, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resilience versus obsolescence (keeper/machine; man/garden) coheres through image and action rather than sermon. The pearl’s meaning reweights at the end, reframing a “beacon” as quiet, earned steadiness. A few explicit theme lines (“to root hope in the real, not the illusory”) flirt with stating the thesis, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final image invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—creation through embraced darkness and the price of wholeness—is embodied by the redesign ritual and the ache that persists. Tarot as fragmented fate mirrors the shattered self and world, then reweights meaning when the box heals. However, the final sentence is a direct thesis (“What is art…”) that slightly undercuts subtext by stating what the images already convey. Without that explicitness, the resonance would feel deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ephemerality, crisis dilation, and “serene anger” braid through ink patterns and eclipse light for a coherent thematic web. The final insight, framed as “neural surge/amplified adrenaline,” undercuts the story’s mystique and reads slightly prosaic. Still, the vanishing/reemergence image reweights the motif of disappearing script into a knowledge gain. Minimal moralizing creep (“save lives”) tones the resonance down a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of truth shattering sanctioned silence emerges organically from particulars (cryo‑archiving, contraband letter, illicit networks) and reweights in the final charged hush. The last image shifts “dizzying quiet” into “dizzying hope,” a neat conceptual repricing. Occasional explicit statements (“to provoke an unspoken conversation”) edge toward thesis‑telling. Complexity is present but not deeply ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of pacifism, transformation, and continuity arise from concrete acts (repurposing wreckage, pruning, whisper‑teaching plants). “Engraved quiet” refracts into ethic and tactic, culminating in a resonant image that reweights the world’s noise. A few lines verge on thesis (“to weave continuity through chaos”) but are supported by scene work. The ending lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Capture versus communion, possession versus letting go, and “voicing silence” cohere into a quiet ethic of stewardship. The final release reweights prior images without moralizing, and the goddess’s sorrow script adds a humane undertone. The resonance lingers, though its ambiguity is gentle rather than cutting. Earned, understated, and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “orbits of regret” motif coherently threads through plot, setting, and final stance, reweighted by the decision to “break their pull.” The logic trope (proof by contradiction) ties theme to method in a non‑obvious way. A few declaratives (“Proof by contradiction demanded…”) verge on telling, but the ending image earns resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of guilt, translation, and time’s reparative/illusory nature emerge organically from objects and actions. The amber and “meteor hush” shift from atmosphere to moral frame, reweighting the final hush. The explicit forgiveness line risks sentimentality but is supported by prior beats. Ambiguity remains about metaphysical cost, which helps the resonance linger.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—finding communal meaning in chaos—emerges from particulars: the mandala, the tile, the hush. The line “your regrets aren’t isolated storms” edges toward thesis, but it’s anchored in on‑page action and subtextual resonance. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity is present in the shared vulnerability more than in overt paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres through action: renaming as redefinition of fate, mercy as subversion of violence, and memory’s cost shaping present choices. Recurring images (warm coldness, shattered sky, tessera) reweight meaning at the end without sermonizing. The line about “ignite a revolution of kindness” edges toward statement, but the scene work largely earns it. Subtext of complicity (humans commanding machines) adds moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of possibility, nostalgia, and performance are woven through particulars: the Fool/Wheel coin, encore hunger, orchard echoes. The final image (coin-in-pocket at dawn) offers a non-literal answer—reframing despair as charged possibility—without moralizing. A few lines verge on direct thesis (“See how possibilities linger”), slightly reducing subtext’s tension. Still, the encore/payoff symmetry achieves resonant cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: art and body‑sense as bridges between skepticism and belief. The “willowglass hope” motif and light trails reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. A few lines verge on on‑the‑nose thesis (“to illuminate hidden pathways”), but the final image earns resonance. Subtext of fear-of-disinterest vs. trust is effectively threaded.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Bridging old/new through a “transitional object” aligns nicely with the vocation of mapping emotions; the final image reaffirms that charge. Some explicit labeling (“transitional object,” “factually mystical”) edges into thesis-speak, dampening subtext. Still, the particulars (piezoelectric veins, altered gravity) carry the theme more than any moral. Resonance lingers as curiosity and vocation marry, without neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance is strong in the buttons-as-shared-journeys motif and the final reweighting of prophecy into communal choice. However, the explicit statement (“It spoke of unity…prophecies were but echoes of choices”) edges into moralizing, reducing subtext. The best thematic work is in particulars (pairing the spiral silver button with the hermit’s toggle to yield “weave”). Afterimage is genuine but slightly explained.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring motifs (snow’s impermanence, pillbox inscription, hush) coherently support themes of quiet courage and repair. The final image of melt as renewal is resonant. However, explicit thesis lines (“unused courage waits,” “I’ve come to fix it”) edge into on-the-nose moralizing and mute subtext. The piece invites reflection but could trust imagery more.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of stripping accreted corruption to an ethical core is organically enacted via palimpsest, river sediment, and spindrift motifs. The final choice reweights the narrative away from possession toward guardianship without sermonizing. Slight tidiness in the insight (“fundamental essence of protection”) reads more declared than wrestled with. Nonetheless, the image chain coheres and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kindness/resilience thesis arises from particulars (beekeepers' acts, Elias’s gentle mending) and coheres with the final image. However, the theme is stated outright (“This oasis resisted change not through force, but through accumulated kindness...”), blunting subtext. The resonance lingers, but the explicit articulation in the closing stretch reduces ambiguity. Subtext otherwise works via “phototropic to kindness.”

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of protected vulnerability/renewal emerges through concrete acts (redirected light, careful notching) and recurring images (rosebush, prisms, hush). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing, letting the harbor’s glimmers answer the initial loss. Subtext hums in the balance between safeguarding and exposure. It invites reflection with tight image logic rather than thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief, coexistence with memory, and self-forging are coherently woven through recurring images and culminate in letting go. However, lines like “These brittle awakenings were not weaknesses” and “Independence bloomed” state the moral too directly, dampening subtext. Earlier imagery earns most of the insight; the final paragraph partially over-explains. The resonance lingers but could trust images more.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs (thread/spiral/lanterns/temple) cohere into a theme of turning private longing into communal connection. Subtext operates in images (the nest spiral “pulsing”) more than in speech, which preserves lyric resonance. Occasional direct statement (“to find the thread that connects all things”) verges on on‑the‑nose. Still, the final shared quiet reweights the premise without a spelled‑out moral.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: manipulation via unseen frequencies, the ethics of intervention, and knowledge as a tool to mend division. The final image offers a quiet, earned repricing—victory as temporary, vigilance required—without moralizing. Expository lines about “harvesting emotional energies” edge toward telling, flattening subtext. The piece invites reflection but skews explicit over suggestive at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    “Wistful rebellion” coheres through the star/stone dialectic and culminates in a repricing of freedom (not escape but defiance). A few explicit thesis lines (“a tool for those rebelling…,” “true freedom came…”) edge toward telling. Still, the final image of altered stars and a lingering melancholy carries thematic aftereffect. Subtext lives best in the organ’s haunting echo and the enlarged chamber banishing fear.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “unifying opposites” motif threads through object, setting, and vocation and reweights the final image. However, the theme is articulated directly several times, edging toward thesis rather than subtext. Still, the last movement reframes the mask/grave and blindness/recognition in a resonant way without outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Inheritance, redemption, and institutional corruption emerge through particulars—the ritualized copper nail, coded stanzas, tribunal site. Weather-chaos as generational echo is suggestive, though the line about “calm[ing] the skies’ inherited rage” edges toward on-the-nose. The final stance reweights legacy with cost, inviting reflection without sermon. Subtext largely rides image and choice rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Pixelated amnesty” functions as a thematic frame and returns at the end as a personal pardon, reweighting earlier detail. The story integrates forgiveness, haunted technology, and bridges without sermonizing, though there are explicit thesis lines (“a forgiveness doled out in bits and bytes”). The final music image answers the central question with a quiet, earned poise. Slight on-the-nose phrasing trims resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cycle motif, foreign bills, and dusk atmosphere organically braid into a reflection on recurrence and restraint. The final image reweights prior material: boundaries made from past plunder suggest repurposed legacy. Some lines edge toward thesis-stating (“paths circle back to teach resilience”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, resonance lingers through image rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Shared burdens and witness recur through stars/inscriptions/daylily and culminate in a communal stance. Some lines tip toward thesis-stating (“Burden shared, dawn breaks eternal”), reducing subtext. Still, the final image of mapping together reweights prior particulars effectively. The metaphor of variable stars as communal brightening is apt and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of seeing “what mirrors don’t show” integrates with action (hidden path, frozen confession, unbending self) and culminates in a meaningful repricing of guardedness. The plant’s consumption of malevolence mirrors the internal work. However, the piece occasionally states theme too directly (“discovering at last what mirrors don't show”), edging into Thematic Echo. The confession line risks tidiness but retains emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of symbiosis, covenant, and healing via shared wounds emerge from concrete acts (linking scars) rather than moralizing. The final image reweights earlier motifs (maze, roots) toward a non‑dominating fusion. A few lines verge on thesis (“pledges to nurture the fusion without domination”), which slightly blunts subtext. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of barter, sacrifice, and meaning‑making arise organically through ritual, objects, and images, not stated morals. The Fool card and “inlaying meaning everywhere” thread toward a resonant understanding: healing requires personal wounding. The ending’s quiet endurance reads as earned stasis with conceptual weight. A touch more ambivalence or counterpressure could deepen subtext further.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (“echo,” quarry, applause, the scrap) accrue meaning and culminate in a resonant final image. Subtext surfaces when Jack’s factual patter cracks, revealing grief and longing. The piece undercuts itself with an explicit thesis statement (“realized his motivation—to discover purpose after loss—wasn’t…”) that edges into moralizing. The emotional aftertaste is honest but a bit safe.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs of seeds, magnetism, and transition cohere into a thoughtful meditation on grief and persistence. The ending’s “intimate understanding” offers a resonant answer without a moral, though several analogies are spelled out rather than left to subtext. The ambitions‑as‑seeds turn is apt and earned by prior images. Sentiment is controlled, if a touch safe.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of unity through contradiction and sustaining wonder accrue through concrete images (sailor/monk essences, smelting by acceptance). Some lines tilt toward thesis‑telling (“to preserve wonder…”) rather than letting subtext carry. The final “Wonder endures” risks mild moralizing yet is earned by the ritual’s specifics. Resonance lingers but could deepen with a sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (crystal hush, pearl radiance, confessions) accumulate into a coherent theme of communal hope versus isolating survival. The final image reweights earlier details, though several lines state theme overtly (“sanctuary for the soul,” “bearer of hope”), blunting subtext. The insight is earned enough to resonate but leans toward declarative moral. Ambiguity about costs ahead could deepen the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rivers, rails, bends, and patched bellows braid into a consistent meditation on forgiveness as honoring deviations. The final repricing (“not erasing the flood but honoring the new path”) is resonant, if a shade explicit. Graffiti aphorisms risk platitude but land as earned through scene and object interplay. The ending image carries quiet emotional aftereffect without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—voice for the voiceless, ethics of extraction, patience over hunger—emerges from particulars (backward phrases, induced delays) rather than declarations. The final withdrawal reweights prior images with a modest moral cost. Occasional direct statements blunt subtext. Still, the motif of reversal turned witness yields a resonant aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Propagation and perforation entwine into a coherent theme about reshaping, not erasing, fate. The fern’s plea and the coffee-stain iconography return with reweighted meaning at the end. Occasional explicitness (“she understood”) blunts subtext slightly, but the final image earns resonance without prescribing a moral. The compromise feels thematically honest.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of threshold, defiance, and the ethics of preservation arise through ritual specifics and recurring images, not moralizing. The ending’s self‑query reweights earlier acts, extending resonance without closing it neatly. “Patterns in static” becomes a metaphysic for identity and grief. Subtext persists in the beautician mortician’s artistry as rebellion against stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    Forgiveness, renewal, and contentment cohere through recurring images (hairpin, veils, hush, cycles). The final realization ties theme to enacted care, but the line “contentment’s source revealed… the act of caregiving itself” states the thesis rather than letting image carry it. Subtext exists in the gentle force of “kindly decisive,” though ambiguity and counter-pressure are limited. The resonance is earned but slightly sermonized.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (cloak, shard, wind chimes) align with doubt vs. certainty, and the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. However, several lines state theme outright (“welcome nuance into certainty”), dulling subtext. The final repricing of Elias’s role adds depth beyond Mara’s decision. Less explicit thesising would heighten the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of patience, pedagogy, and “vanishing to appear” emerge through the pond ritual and withheld interpretation. Some lines articulate thesis directly, slightly blunting subtext, yet the final image reweights the lesson rather than moralizing it flatly. The reveal reframes method as ethic. Resonance lingers, quiet and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stillness versus pursuit, harmony versus fracture, and reverence for ancestry cohere through concrete images (arrowhead, flock, dust). The final image reprices movement as internal gravity rather than chase, a resonant—if quiet—answer. No moralizing intrudes, and motifs recur with meaning. Ambiguity lingers productively about whether hope can withstand the canyon’s unrest.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story’s theme—authentic wonder vs. automated creativity—emerges through concrete pursuit and the keystone’s gentle, persistent light. However, explicit declarations (“No algorithm could replicate…”) edge into moralizing and reduce subtext in the final third. The final image resonates, but the stated thesis slightly blunts ambiguity. The best moments earn meaning through image (upward‑floating petals, melting frost).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (lanterns as vows, “hides behind truth,” synesthetic hues) braid into a coherent inquiry about perception and intention. The luminous vow he speaks reweights the premise in the ending without moralizing. The “Aether Inn” exposition edges toward telling, slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final image—lighting lamps as vows to hidden colors—lands with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through action: doubt as fuel, cyclical cosmology, purpose found via ritual and attention. The “backwards prophecy” reframes time and reweights the ending, avoiding overt moralizing despite a declarative last line. The final statement crystallizes the piece’s question without flattening ambiguity. Subtext in the coins-as-lots and amber-preservation enriches the meditation on chance, endurance, and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme (sacrifice transformed by naming, intimacy at a distance) arises from concrete acts and recurring images (echoes, light, atlas, monsters). The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext of complicity in loss hums beneath the ritual; “honored her sacrifice” avoids sentimentality by anchoring in cost. Slight safety in the arc (no sharp counter‑thesis) keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of humble agency, faith under strain, and repairing a broken bond emerge through concrete images (cracked bell, weeping sapphire). “Plausible impossibility” is well integrated and reweights the ending. A few abstractions (“cosmic imbalance,” “brittle devotion”) are told outright, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final toll and spectral fish deliver a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and communal renewal accrue through images (resurfacing town, blue label, silent chime) rather than lecture. The ending’s chorus image earns a felt repricing of loss into legacy. A few explicit statements (“Elias’s motivation had always been...”) edge toward telling, slightly dulling subtext. Overall resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—mind/spirit harmony—emerges through concrete images (runes of flame, thawing crystal) and culminates in a reweighted talisman. Subtext resides in the grandmother motif and the charged trust in the murmuration. A few explicit statements (“Her motivation burned deep...”) slightly over‑explain what the images already earn. The ending resonates without slipping into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of stewardship, earned trust, and embodied knowledge emerge from concrete particulars (buckle, drills, silent arbor). The “soundless echo” motif accrues meaning and modulates the final hope‑toned image. Occasional explicit statement (“to preserve trust under pressure”) trims subtlety. Still, the ending reweights prior images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of integration through complementary opposites emerges through specific objects and actions (blade slicing pretense; joint chant; shattering jar). Subtext surfaces in exposing the clone’s fear, but the line “we are mirrors” states the thesis a bit directly. The final warmth and stabilized history reweight prior material without moralizing. Resonance lingers as a reclamation of feeling via self-reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of receptivity, orthogonal thinking, and safeguarding creative space emerge organically from particulars (seed, brook, corpse flower metaphor). The corpse flower as slow, spectacular bloom reweights the seed’s meaning at the end. Some lines verge on meta‑statement, but the final image avoids overt moralizing. Resonance lingers, if more contemplative than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Tending to the unspoken” integrates with the off‑key wind and maceration motif to yield a non‑didactic meditation on grief and imperfect beauty. The ending reframes performance into care, with a clear price. The thematic pattern is earned through images rather than moralizing. Slight neatness in the family’s transformation keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around uncertainty as companion and the “boundaries of light” shifting from barrier to invitation. The pendant’s ritual grounds the insight, avoiding mere sermonizing even as a few lines verge on thesis. The final image reweights prior material into fragile peace without tidy moral closure. Subtext runs through image patterning (mist, frost, light/shadow lovers) with credible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of creative destruction and renewal emerge organically through the ritual and iterative smashing. The final image reweights the premise (curse as illusion) and ties to motifs (embers, phoenix) without didactic summary. A single explicit line (“he realized the curse was not eternal”) nudges toward on‑the‑nose, tempering subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres—silence as canvas, beginnings seeded in endings—through action with the shard and the city’s reimagining. The “shard of hush” motif and the mentor memory return to charge the final image. At times the piece states its thesis (“discarding another assumption…”) rather than trusting subtext, trimming resonance. Still, the ending reweights prior material with a clean, non‑moralizing image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of unity, liminality, and “permanent transient” recur through concrete images (clocks, hourglass, merging ferries). However, the text sometimes states its thesis outright (“he understood the tone of their world: permanent transient”), blunting subtext. The final image reweights identity without sermonizing, but leans close to moralizing. Resonance is present if not deepened by contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (thread, mirrors, light) accrue into a coherent meditation on grief, memory, and connection; the final serene dissolution reweights the premise. However, the explicit line “In that moment, he understood...” tips into thematic statement, softening subtext. The resonance is real, yet partially told rather than entirely earned through image. A more implicit last beat would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tether/chain motif and “unfolded horizons” synthesize a theme of expansion tempered by responsibility. The final vow reframes achievement with humility, avoiding sermonizing while staying legible. Occasional explicit phrasing slightly flirts with telling, but most resonance arises from image. The piece invites reflection on cost without closing it down.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of connection, closure, and quiet, incidental heroism arise from concrete beats (signal, photo, assurance). Subtext hums in the “reeling hush,” the antique hearing aid, and the last photograph’s wear. Some lines overstate the moral (“proving that tracing hearts could heal more than intended”), tipping toward sentiment. The final image is resonant but a shade declared.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Memory, transmission, and obligation braid through the cables-as-conduits metaphor, with the phase transitions doubling as a passage from limbo to release. The codex’s gold fleck and “crashing hush” recur and reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. Alex’s small internal victory (phobia momentarily conquered) aligns with the larger ethical act, producing a clean, resonant afterimage. A deeper ambiguity about the cost of release might have amplified resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of failure as generative is organically tied to shard/ink and Alex’s “paper death,” culminating in a repriced sense of survival. Yet the line “failure is the forge” edges into didactic clarity, slightly dulling subtext. The porcelain’s “break that birthed wisdom” resonates well as motif. The final quiet balm earns feeling without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of translation, preservation, and transforming curse into guardianship arise organically from concrete action. The birds’ patterns reframing a language’s cadence is an earned metaphor that reweights the premise at the end. No sermonizing; the final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (texture made sound, life made echo) with a bittersweet cost. Slight neatness in success trims the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres: loss reconfigured into playful, untamed harmony; the world’s altered physics mirrors her repricing of grief. The early bitterness and the closing “grand jest” image resonate. Some thematic phrasing is on-the-nose (“This is my confession,” “cosmos’s grand jest”), slightly dampening subtext. Still, the final floating image reweights prior material without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Transformation and liberation are coherently threaded through recurring images (locust shell, rust, rhythm) and reweighted at the end. A few explicit theme statements (“It symbolized,” “She understood now”) reduce subtext. Still, the final image of tarnished wonder polished by action resonates. The thematic arc arises from concrete choices rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of mending and reconciliation arise from particulars—the woman’s photo, the locket, the son’s letter—rather than lecture. The “linking absences” motif threads the piece and reweights the closing resolve. Occasional explicit statements (“to find where broken promises heal”) push toward telling and graze sentimentality. Overall, the ending offers a resonant image of quiet, costly persistence without a moral spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: silence reinterpreted as possibility through concrete images (bells, halo, grove) rather than lecture. The final image reweights prior material (he carries the gleam within), creating a resonant answer to the opening hush. Occasional overt phrasing (“interpret silence not as an end, but as possibility”) grazes didactic. Ambiguity remains purposeful and humane.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of analog memory versus digital ephemera and stories as non-Euclidean journeys integrate through action and object. Some lines lean toward thesis (“stories weren't linear paths but hyperbolic journeys”), which slightly blunts subtext. The final image reweights earlier material—solitude becomes a bridge, not a void—providing quiet resonance. Complexity is present, though the piece flirts with didactic articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: art as bridge across absence, longing translated into light. Recurring images (whispers, dawn, cipher/palette) shift meaning at the end when the images become animate emblems of reclaimed love. The piece avoids moralizing and invites reflection without closing interpretive space. Slight tidiness in the final assurance (“proving that… dreams could be vitalized anew”) trims complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of courage transforming fear and love as a bridge emerge coherently through images (hair to starlight web). The line “secrets were not barriers but cocoons” edges into explicit thesis, muting subtext. The final voice-only visitation offers a resonant answer—release rather than reunion—without mechanical moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lands, if a bit pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of curiosity, memory, and earned return cohere through image and action (rings, stars, aging). However, the last line’s “real treasure” declares the moral, tipping into tidy sentiment and thinning subtext. The fairy escrow notion adds nuance but is under-tested. Resonant, but partially told rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resilience through confrontation, not consolation, emerges from particulars (tea‑geometry, shard symmetries, the shadow’s return). Thematic lines verge on explicit (“Your exile reverses when you face what you fled”), softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without a moral lecture, and the mentor’s method embodies the theme. The echo of walking backward renders an elegant, near‑subtextual transmission of resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of safeguarding wonder is coherent and echoed through image (seed, mist, children’s return). Some lines lapse into overt statement (“adults dismissed the sparkle… as mere science”), reducing subtext. The final image reaffirms wonder’s renewal but avoids complexity or counter-pressure. Resonant, not probing.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silence, inheritance, and truth as release emerge organically through the net’s properties and the ritual’s demands; the “interlaced hush” reweights meaning at the end. The final calm feels earned, not moralized, and the piece invites reflection on complicity versus duty. A hint more aftermath ambiguity could have deepened the resonance. Nonetheless, the symbolic system is coherent and active.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silence/empathy/ritual motifs accrue and reconfigure at the end: silence becomes agency, the henge a “living echo” rather than a relic. Thematic statements veer close to telling in places (“silence wasn’t absence”), but the closing image earns resonance. The map’s tear as liminal boundary reframes knowledge vs. unknown. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (snow globe, transmission, gravity) braid well, and the ending offers a resonant image of equilibrium over erasure. However, thematic articulation occasionally becomes explicit (“The physics of letting go...”), edging toward moralizing. The note’s aphorism underlines what the images already prove, dulling subtext. Still, the echoes (flakes settling, lights dimming, ascent) carry genuine aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of articulation, connection, and bridging realms emerge organically from the encoded graffiti and the final promise. Some lines verge on thesis statements (“Hear me, free me...”), trimming subtext. The ending resonates but risks sentimentality by resolving friction cleanly. Still, the image of code-blooming flowers carries real aftertone.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres through concrete images (ice/light, decoding, ascent) rather than sermonizing, culminating in a revaluation of pain as carrier of joy. The affectionate detachment stance is enacted in his choice to preserve rather than purge; the closing “keeper of encrypted light” reframes duty. A few explicit statements of the thesis slightly blunt subtlety. Resonance lingers without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory-in-absence, tether/wholeness, and reweaving grief are integrated through recurring images (string, spool, telescope, clouds) and reweighted at the end. The final image answers the central question non‑literally (mist-portrait, then dissipation), with resonance extending into his decision to continue ascents. One on‑nose sentence—“Here was proof; the empty spaces did remember”—edges toward telling, slightly dulling subtext. Overall, the imagery does most of the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of infinity versus human limit emerges organically from craft, disability, and environment; the coin’s fractal logic smartly reframes “portrait” and “sky.” The ending’s “peace through acknowledged limit” resonates without neat moral payoff. A single explicit line (“discovering limits”) lapses into thesis speak, slightly reducing subtext. Overall, the images carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of connection within solitude, inherited knowledge, and reading the world’s hidden grammars emerge organically through objects and action. The final image reweights earlier motifs (dog‑ear as talisman, “stranded luminance” as rule‑set) without overt moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, though the lack of cost limits the depth of repricing. The emotional aftertaste is gentle resonance rather than profound unsettlement.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres around repair, time, and the ache of nostalgia; the ending reweights prior images as the rhythm becomes temporal mending, not mere mechanism. Subtext flows through sensory recurrence (sea salt, driftwood, frost) rather than moralizing. The insight feels earned by specific action (“uncap” → visions → rhythm syncing to heartbeat). Slight neatness in success tempers depth of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.7)
    Unity vs. isolation is coherent and thematically integrated through the chalk summons and collective ringing. Subtext is largely overt, with explicit thesis statements (“We must reexamine our solitude”; “Hope blooms in unity”) that edge into moralizing. The closing image resonates, but complexity is limited, and ambiguity is minimal. The piece invites reflection mostly through motif recurrence rather than layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Impermanence, consolation, and “beautifully flawed” acceptance emerge through concrete images (cracked porcelain as key). The ending reweights the premise with the sighing reseal and lingering lullaby—resonant without moralizing. Slight thematic monotone from sustained reverence keeps it just shy of exceptional. Still, the motif web coheres impressively.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Duty versus desire, invisible care, and “graceless beauty” cohere through recurring particulars (orchard, birds, blueprint) rather than abstract statements. The ending’s “beautiful burden” reframes her role without sermonizing, offering a resonant acceptance with cost. Subtext of lineage and quiet service surfaces through action. Complexity is present, though not deeply ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring images (braids, polymers, foam, chrysalis) cohere around separation becoming connection. A few lines tip into thesis (“atonement lay not in apologies alone...”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs without didacticism in the last moment. Emotional aftereffect is sincere and cohesive, if a bit safe.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of beginnings-from-absence and liberation via self‑release accrue through object/actions and pay off in her renunciation. “Glimmering parole” gains moral weight when she applies it to herself. The final line edges toward thesis-statement explicitness, softening resonance. Still, the conceptual repricing of void as genesis lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Regret as a transmissible substance, stored and reworked by craft, yields a strong thematic braid of responsibility, contamination, and redemption. The coral/ice motif and the “sanding” lexicon accrue and shift meaning in the final image of resilience. The piece avoids overt moralizing. Some symbols verge on explicit labeling, trimming the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of community, language as bridge, and repurposing the ornamental into the vital (cuckoo weight) emerge organically. Some moments verge on didactic (“Listen to the talks…build together”), slightly flattening subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs without a stated moral. Complexity is present but not thorny; ambiguity is gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (helix, entanglement, mirror) cohere into a theme of reconfiguring the self through fractured remembrance. The piece skirts didacticism with overt “synaptic plasticity” framing but mostly earns its insights through images and repetition under pressure. The final image reweights earlier material without a spelled‑out moral. Subtext around parental approval and mentorship adds texture.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of vigilance versus knowledge‑seeking and refracted perception thread through object and environment. The final image affirms the pursuit of hidden combinations more than it reweights it with complexity or cost. Subtext exists (guardianship as ethical counterweight) but remains underdeveloped. The piece avoids moralizing, yet lands on a straightforward triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of empathy, fracture into harmony, and listening are earned through concrete acts (reading stress lines, modulating touch). The silence becoming “enriched” rather than broken reframes connection without moralizing. A few explicit formulations (“empathy in motion”) edge toward told theme but are supported by scene work. Resonance lingers in the final quiet, not a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through specifics: silence-as-language, eclipse-as-temporary darkness, the dent as beauty in friction. The final image reweights prior motifs (pawn to queendom, eclipsed covenant, aligned spirit) without resorting to a spelled-out moral. A couple of lines flirt with bald statement (“He saw it now—the beauty in the difficult”), but most meaning rises from image and action. The resonance lingers as a disciplined hope.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—empathy through listening to silence—emerges organically from events and recurring images. Yet it’s at times over-declared (“teaching pacifism through the art of listening,” “empathy bloomed not in confrontation”), muting subtext in peak beats. The fireworks and clasp reprise do meaningful work, but some final-paragraph moralizing dilutes resonance. The emotional aftertaste remains warm and specific despite the overt statements.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of renewal through rot and serenity within motion accrue organically via scent, doodled maps, and the corpse flower’s paradox. The final repricing—turning repulsion into village wisdom—resonates. Occasional lines state the thesis directly (“true strength lies in rooting deep while swaying free”), blunting subtext. Still, the concluding image of the journal as a communal guide lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resilience and stewardship emerge through the echoes’ legacy and the growth‑arrow’s history, linking personal need to planetary caretaking. The “gathering of echoes” adds a graceful, nonliteral layer without sermonizing. Thematic resolution is a touch neat, with minimal ambiguity or price. The final promise of renewal resonates but doesn’t reprice the premise with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of foresight, adaptation, and convergence arise from concrete process and setting, not just statements. However, some lines verge on thesis (“She would report not just the accident, but the foresight needed to avert the next”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior material with modest resonance (haze lifting, charts in hand). Strong integration, if a bit declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of wonder’s necessity and art as creation’s chisel emerge through recurring images (sculpted hush, chisel, aurora). However, the thesis is stated outright multiple times, especially near the end, reducing subtext. The final image reweights earlier material but edges toward moralizing rather than letting the scene speak. Resonance lingers, but with less ambiguity than top‑tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (humility vs. isolation; learning from failure) emerges through ritual and image, and the final choice reweights the premise. Yet the explicit articulation—“spirits whispered failures turned to lessons: humility… folly of isolation…”—edges into moral summary, reducing subtext. The final image is resonant but somewhat declarative (“forge alliances”). Strong integration, slightly dulled by didactic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: ambiguity as method, empathy as function, and the cost of borrowing identities. The final repricing resists tidy moralizing, offering a resonant stance—truth exists in dynamic unpredictability. The halo and star-void images carry subtext without sermonizing. Minor explicitness in the realization is earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of wonder as a contagious legacy and the fade from memory to myth accrue organically through specific images (humming wings syncing with breath, satchel lighter, villagers’ tales). The final repricing of mentorship through action rather than assertion mostly succeeds. A few lines edge toward overt thesis (“Word of the jittery courier spread...”), slightly flattening the subtext. Overall resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of material memory and the ethics of “truthful lies” emerges through action, not just assertion; the prism/frost method makes the idea felt. The ending reweights the premise as Marcus leaves lighter, the hush lifting. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“emotions don’t vanish; they seep...”), slightly reducing subtextual pressure. Still, resonance persists without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of maternal devotion, memory, and sacrifice emerge organically through image and act, not moralizing. Recurring objects (amber bead, puzzle edges, loom) accrue meaning and reweight in the final hush. The ending’s image offers a resonant answer to the central question: love bridges the chasm at irreversible cost. Ambiguity remains purposeful—did the message reach?—without blurring stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resilience from rubble and transactional revival (“bartered awakenings”) arise organically from the silk ritual and the final image of guardians restoring orchards. The azure defiance motif recurs and charges the ending. Complexity is modest—ambiguity exists around the planet’s “between understanding and confusion,” but the piece leans to a tidy restorative arc. No sermonizing, but the insight is more affirmed than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of secrecy, protection through silence, and the burden of inherited shame arise organically from her pursuit and the brother’s reveal. The shard’s cool‑down and “dawn” image offer a resonant, if slightly on‑the‑nose, closing cadence. Subtext operates in sensory motifs and the idea of mapping intangible truths. Avoids moralizing but leans on familiar redemption notes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of bottling safety and transmuting grief into communal care emerges through concrete acts (letter chain → spectral extension). Subtext hums in the “luminescent ache” that shifts from burden to balm without stating a moral. The final image reweights the premise: safety is a shared, portable ritual, not only a beam. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—reviving communal wisdom versus flickering data—is woven through object, setting, and ritual and reweighted by the final silhouettes. Subtext operates in image (old glooms repurposed) rather than moralizing, with a lingering ambiguity about cost. A few declaratives (“She believed…”) verge on telling but do not swamp the scene. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres—gentle illumination draws stories; reflect rather than claim—but it edges into explicit thesis (“Elias understood: stories magnetized...”) near the end. Recurring images (wing, sun trails, mist, quiet explosions) do real work and reweight the final image. The epiphany is earned through particulars, though the moral clarity feels slightly over-articulated. Subtext exists but is occasionally told.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically through actions: labor, repair, measurement leading to a revaluation of grief into resilience. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“trees witnessed resilience”), but they’re anchored in the constructed map and prior particulars. The closing return to maintenance with peace ties “mundane miracles” to an earned stasis rather than a moral. The “quantified sorrow” motif meaningfully reframes suffering without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Community repair through memory and light emerges organically from the particulars (songs, swaddling, woven dawns) without moralizing. The final reconfiguration—true dawn returning—reweights earlier images of inversion and loss. The thematic weave is cohesive and emotionally resonant. Complexity is maintained without flattening into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Paradox threads integrate with action (hidden door via paradox book; “staying while leaving” embodied). The final image reweights earlier material through compassionate anonymity. However, the line “In staying while leaving, he unearthed the wisdom he sought” overstates the theme, tipping toward moralizing. Subtext with the betrayer’s regret is strong and could carry more of the load without explicit thesising.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres elegantly around noticing, gentle intervention, and resisting “creeping normality,” culminating in a reweighted final image. The bread as vanished legacy feeding new life is a strong subtextual move. A few direct statements (“His motivation burned…,” “His motivation fulfilled…”) verge on telling, softening the subtlety. Still, the mosaic/bird mirroring and winter’s counterpoint yield honest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: memory’s fragility, duty against oblivion, and the ethics of preservation. The recurring object (slide/vials) and luminous vows reweight the ending without moralizing; the final sealing is a resonant acceptance of partial meaning. Subtext in frequency layers (passion vs. resolve vs. fear) deepens the human texture of promises. The piece resists neat conclusions and leaves a charged afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Trust, silence, and complicity are threaded through the “truce of hush,” with the recording as a thematic instrument rather than mere plot prop. The final image of dawn and the “echo of justice” reframes vengeance as curated proof, a tidy but resonant repricing. A couple of on‑the‑nose phrasings (“a balm for old wounds”) slightly flatten the aftertaste. Subtext in the quiet sabotage and indirect confrontation works well.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of “futuristic nostalgia,” chaos vs. control, and guardianship of the wild accrue through motifs (aurora, forest elections, taste‑compass). The final image reweights the premise with her nascent weather, tying personal change to concept. However, the line “It’s nostalgia for chaos” overstates the thesis, blunting subtext. Despite that, the piece leaves a reflective afterglow grounded in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lock and “auroral sorrow” motifs coherently refract the theme of self-corked potential and reclamation. The final image (tears and renewed sketching) answers the question without a moral. A couple of statements flirt with on-the-nose (“cursed,” “frivolous pursuit”), but most resonance arises from action and image. The symbolism stays integrated rather than grafted on.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of “candor in small moments” integrates through the lie‑sensing leaves and the vault of preserved unsaid words, culminating in a reweighted understanding. The final experience earns insight, especially via the reread inscription. Some lines verge on declarative thesis (“No longer would unspoken truths wilt away”), softening subtext. Still, the imagery‑driven resolution leaves a resonant aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of silence vs. truth, craft as communion, and wonder’s fragility emerge organically through making and activation rather than summary. “Symphonies of truth” shifts from concept to embodied sound/light, offering a resonant non‑literal answer in the final image. The piece avoids moralizing, allowing readers to feel the repricing of wonder without a thesis statement. Ambiguity remains purposeful and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of inherited fear, containment-as-care, and integration land via particulars (neural-wood box, seed‑pod packets, controlled burn as transformation). The final image reweights the premise: fears become a bridge to empathy rather than a burden. A couple lines verge on tidy (“guardian of roses and remembrances”), but the resonance is earned through action. Ambiguity remains around future costs, which enriches the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme—listening as healing—is organically supported by Elena’s method and the communal letters, and the final image of unity resonates. However, it is also explicitly stated (“proving her belief: listening heals”), blunting subtext. Some complexity emerges (wartime betrayals, forgiveness), yet the conclusion leans tidy. The motif of “sandstorm calm” threads meaning effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—encryption of vulnerability into strength—emerges through concrete practices (journal-as-cipher, dance-as-translation) rather than moralizing. The final liberation of “trapped echoes” widens the personal theme into communal consequence, adding resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively (mysterious familiarity; probabilistic fate). Slightly tidy uplift at the end trims complexity but doesn’t collapse it.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Resonant themes of grief, chosen forgetting, and nature as a repository of memory accrue through specific images (pressed flowers, suspended waves). The final concept reweights the world—memories as driftwood in gravitational pockets—without moralizing. Subtextual tension (relief from pain vs. integrity of memory) sustains. Slight neatness in the “map” moment trims ambiguity but not impact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of suppression versus balance, and the ethics of quieting dangerous knowledge, arise through image and action. The final peace/ember image reweights earlier “blaze,” hinting at the cost of self‑extinguishing drive. Subtext is present but not deeply conflicted, reducing lingering ambiguity. No overt moralizing undercuts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of pedagogy-through-fabrication and truth as consensual narrative are woven through object and ritual. The final image reweights earlier lies as bridges, but the explicit line “the language…was not just words, but the stories we agree to believe” states what the images already earned, blunting subtlety. Subtext lives in their shared “agreed lies” and the hum of the building. Resonance is solid, if a touch declared.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mirrored quarantines (guardian and Elara) and the shell’s reweighted silence create a resonant answer about translating isolation. However, thematic articulation veers into explicit moralizing in the final lines (“true independence was not solitude’s end, but its masterful translation”), dulling subtext. The strongest resonance comes in images, not the thesis excerpts. Tightening toward implication would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of patience, craft as rebellion, and forgiveness accrue through images (drip of time, “calibrated treason,” thorn as conscience) and culminate in a reweighted ending. The story resists moralizing, though lines like “meant releasing Silas’s ghost” tilt toward explicitness. The final act reframes betrayal as charged endurance without sermon. The motifs meaningfully return and slightly reconfigure the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of completion vs. lingering, stewardship vs. control, and memory as ethical echo emerge organically through shells, song, and choice. The realization about the mother’s completed song reweights earlier grief effectively. Some exposition (“visions of souls judged…”) and the final declarative line edge toward telling. Subtext exists in Thorne’s melancholy but could deepen with more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from action and image—purity salvaged from wreckage, borrowed light, careful truth-telling. The final image (aurora, globe secured) reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. A few explanatory lines edge toward telling, but overall the resonance holds. Ambiguity around cost and impact on descendants keeps the piece reflective rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of unseen effort emerges through concrete recurrences (nets, froth, grooves, rain-carved parapet) rather than abstract sermonizing. The ending reweights prior images with a commitment to teach others to “see the unseen,” avoiding a tidy moral while offering resonance. A few phrases edge toward thesis-stating (“demure audacity,” “quiet rebellion”) but remain tied to image. Subtext resides in labor’s invisibility and the weathered tools’ testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of truth versus comforting lies integrates with the stillpoint concept and Elias’s vocation; the orchard reframes “miracle” as science. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, leaving a resonant dilemma. Subtext around exploitation and protection lingers. A touch less explicit labeling (“this wasn’t magic, but exploitable science”) would heighten subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around renewal from “ancient shadows” and the instability of human allegiance, developed via recurring radio ghosts and the portico’s cracks. The final image reweights the premise—old transmissions birthing a new movement—without lapsing into a moral, though some quoted lines verge on thesis‑speak. Subtext emerges through image patterns (light from umbra) rather than exposition. Resonance is strong if more conceptual than emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of redemption as gleaned, inheritance, and translation are enacted through specific acts (captured laughter sweetening the lullaby). The final image reframes solitude as connective labor, inviting reflection without neat moralizing. A few explicit thesis lines (“He believed that redemption…”) edge toward telling. Overall resonance is strong and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Absolution versus guilt is dramatized through sound, not lectured, with the lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor integrated into action. The ending’s echo—his own guilt surfacing—reweights prior images. A few direct statements (“beacon of forgiveness”) verge on didactic, but the subtext largely holds.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of patience vs. fury and vigilance vs. wildness emerge organically from maps, moon paths, and the nonviolent tactic. Occasional thesis-forward lines (“patient revolution”) risk overstatement, but the final image (moon path mirrored on the ice) reframes the uprising as a quiet tide. Subtext in her controlled demeanor vs. inner fire works. No false equivalence or sermonizing, yet the moral calculus is a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (lantern, water, hum) braid freedom, repetition, and responsibility into a coherent thematic arc. The final emergence into rain reweights the premise with a hopeful counterimage. However, explicit labeling (“collective spirit of the unfree… manipulating the vulnerable”) states what the images already imply, trimming subtext. The resonance lingers but avoids true thorniness.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of atonement, accountability, and the value of “second opinions” arise organically through object and action. The light-through-clouds image reframes the moral calculus without fanfare. Some thematic lines state conclusions outright, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of hunger/creation (yearning algorithm) and the maker’s audacity accrue through particular images (fractaled runes, mechanical fish, silent bells). The ending reweights prior material: the unheard bell becomes consequential sound with potential harm, complicating awe with responsibility. Avoids moralizing, though the piece leans on voiced declarations of motive more than subtext in places. The resonance lingers but doesn’t cut as deep as it could without more on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, corporate erasure, and the ethics of disappearance emerge through objects, tactics, and the archive’s texture. The 47 motif and the warped songs accumulate into a meditation on absence and preservation. The ending reweights the premise: truth that survives only in a compromised, personal form. No moralizing; resonance comes from image and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of transforming empathy into action integrates with plot and image (visions converted into routes, shelters, pacts). However, the explicit repetition of “map empathy onto action” slips into thesis‑speak, especially near the end, dulling subtext. The final image (orb complete, readiness to act despite verdict) offers resonance without full moral overstatement, but the sermonizing edges lower the score. Ambiguity about costs could be deepened for greater aftershock.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: endings reinterpreted from dread to solace through labor, listening, and inherited fragility (lace/ice). The “fold in patience” reframes waiting vs. acceptance without moralizing. The final image conceptually reprices the premise—wind as the “sound of endings” becomes comfort. Resonance lingers, with ambiguity about sanity integrated rather than explained away.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (burned edge, vines, autumn) accrue meaning and the final image reweights earlier material. However, the last line articulates the thesis explicitly, edging into moralizing and dampening subtext. Prior beats often let images carry the theme well, especially “forever in parallel.” The emotional aftereffect is genuine, but the didactic capstone trims resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of safeguarding ephemeral truth and seeing via “peripheral awareness” accrue through image and method, culminating in binding voice to stone. One overt thesis line (“The wisdom echoes not in words alone…”) edges into telling but aligns with the enacted ritual. The final resonance—quiet endurance over spectacle—lands, though ambiguity around cost keeps it from deeper ache. Subtext sits in contrasts (pavilion murmurs vs. earth rhythms) rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (arcs, vines, lavender) gather meaning and culminate in a resonant reconfiguration—the mural as living puzzle. Occasional explicit statements (“transmuting our hurts into something beautiful”) edge toward telling, slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material persuasively. The theme lands without moral bookkeeping.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of growth versus stasis emerges through the object’s function and the gardener/printer echoes. The ending reweights the premise without sermonizing, though one or two lines verge on thesis (“proved knowledge was not a closed book”). Subtext operates in silence, listening, and the charged return of the crystal. Resonance lingers, if more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of aging, memory, and art‑as‑bulwark arise organically from concrete acts and recurring objects. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: he can weave the sound into his being, not defeat forgetting, accepting cyclical return. No sermonizing; images (chalk circle, driftwood frame, hush of tapes) accrue meaning. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (leaf, moon, spinning hand, photography) braid into a coherent meditation on time, grief, and release. The final image reweights prior material without didactic moralizing, though “Escape velocity achieved—not in flight, but in transcendence” edges toward thesis‑statement clarity. Subtext operates through objects and acts rather than abstract lecture. Emotional resonance is earned, if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of reunification through the ordinary is enacted, not asserted, via the “hymning the mundane” method and the charged shard. “Hope’s scent” risks abstraction, yet its recurrence reweights images and the final peace. Slight on‑the‑nose lines (“The mundane holds the hymns we overlook”) don’t undercut the earned resonance. The ending replays motifs with new meaning rather than offering a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “closing loops” motif elegantly dovetails with repairing bent reality and the personal shadow loop. The Noon Veil revalues shadows as guardians, offering a resonant reframing rather than a neat moral. Some thematic delivery (“They revealed the truth—”) leans expository, trimming subtext. Still, the final charge promises personal and world mending with credible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of forgiveness, doubt, and healing thread through concrete motifs (maze, bone‑setting, constellations). The final image re‑weights earlier material without a neat moral, inviting reflection. Occasional abstraction (“innovation of forgiveness”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut the earned resonance. The bone‑setting metaphor provides a strong thematic spine.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around gentleness over spectacle, balance, and earned atonement. Recurring images (glass, mist, starlight, scales) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The “pearl of stillness” becomes a non‑literal answer to her earlier harms. Slight directness (“Was this enough to atone?”) trims subtlety but doesn’t break resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motifs (amber, honey, moss, algorithms) accrue and reprice meaning at the end without moralizing. The “honeyed hush” reframes healing as shared silence rather than speech, aligning action with theme. One line edges toward overt symbolism (“It symbolized trapped sweetness...”), but the final act earns its resonance. The piece invites reflection on preservation vs. renewal without closing interpretive space.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of authorship, sanctification vs. theft, and hope’s embodiment arise from particulars (cameos, harvesting, shell’s destruction) without moralizing. The final reconfiguration—merging hopes to rebirth his story—offers a resonant nonliteral answer. Complexity is present (guilt vs. need) though not probed adversarially on-page. The lingering image balances wonder with an ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of recovering communal rituals to mend human–nature bonds emerges organically through the ritual and final renewal image. The vine-as-question-mark and hush → birdsong turn provide a modest reweighting at the end. Occasional direct statements (“forgotten practices,” “remedy unfolding”) edge toward telling, trimming subtext. Still, the closing image resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of patience, loss, and transforming waste into guidance emerge organically through particulars (mandalas of remnants; starlight poured into grooves). The final image—map as pulsing heart—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through “moving stillness” rather than thesis-y statement. Slight neatness in the outcome trims complexity, but the resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—reason as a vessel for sustaining wonder—emerges organically through locksmithing, optics, and echo “harvest.” Recurring images (peripheral glints, angles, drips) shift meaning at the end when the cellar of reason fills with timed echoes. A hint of direct statement risks neatness, but the final image earns resonance without a preached moral. The piece invites reflection on craft as devotion in a wounded world.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Order versus recursion, burden as currency, and liberation through balance emerge from concrete acts (calcification, orientation) rather than commentary. Recurring images (whalebone reverie, shingled hush, bronze, fractal threads) accrue and reweight at the end without moralizing. Thematic aftertaste is resonant though not disturbingly complex; ambiguity is contained but present in the cost of self-weaving. Overall, strong integration with the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motifs (“here and gone,” amber/crystallized time, rain beads) accrue into a resonant answer: you don’t conquer impermanence; you hold its shape. A few lines verge on statement (“First lesson,” “That was the method”), softening subtext. Still, meaning is mostly earned through action (mane that stops, weary eyes) and the final image reweights earlier material. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of ambition’s erosion and regret-as-catalyst emerges from concrete images (camera wheel frames, currents, eddies) and the negotiated truce. Subtext operates in the reweighting of stillness/kinetics and the spectral self as both indictment and resource. A few on-the-nose lines (“Ambitions erode”) dull subtlety slightly. The ending’s reshaped ambition avoids a moral and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of repurposed ambition, renewal, and ethical salvage arise from particulars (redirected flows, carnival scrap, dormant seeds) more than declaration. The sextant motif reweights meaning at the end without overt moralizing. Phrases like “equations for hope” edge toward abstract thesis, but the final image mostly carries the resonance. Ambiguity is gentle yet present: cradle vs. tomb recast.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—honoring the path chosen while allowing the abandoned dream to infuse it—emerges through recurring images (timepieces, whispers, rain) and the final reweighting (“inscribe…perhaps a melody or two”). Subtext resides in the sanctuary’s hush as both balm and pressure. A touch of explicitness (“He had come to make peace…”) trims the mystery slightly but does not sink the resonance. The afterimage lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres—myths as engineered structures, truth versus alluring falsity—and the ending reweights prior images. The “architecture of lies” motif is effective but over‑voiced, occasionally stating the thesis outright. Subtext exists in objects (sundial’s backward shadow, calm surface vs. eddies) and lands in the final resolve. Slight moralizing tone trims resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of preservation, patience, and knowledge woven into matter emerge through particulars (knots as runes, the fulgurite’s frozen lightning, the weaver’s cloak). The final image—dawn, fading weaver, enchanted seed—reweights prior motifs without a stated moral. Subtext (craft as wisdom’s vessel; endurance as method) resonates. The piece avoids sermonizing and lands a quiet, durable aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of “explained absences” emerges through image and act, but is also stated outright (“not voids to be mourned, but spaces deliberately carved”), blunting subtext. The final rose/coming frost image resonates and fits the cost of acceptance. Insights feel earned by ritual rather than grafted on, though a lighter touch would deepen afterglow. Emotional honesty holds without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The “flawed genesis” theme emerges organically through the runes and the metallic sheen of the hatchling, culminating in a resonant acceptance of imperfection. The final song reframes beauty as compromised yet potent, which lingers. However, explicit statements (“not failure, but the only path”) edge toward telling the thesis. Subtext works best in images (iron filigree, falling dust) rather than in the overt hypothesizing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres through particulars: coin as repurposed scar, red thread as blood tie, volcanic sand as renewal, culminating in communal witnessing of the tree’s song. Subtext arrives through image rather than sermon, with the final cadence reframing pain as generative. A few explicit statements (“to prove that scars can sing”) nudge toward tell, but the closing image earns the insight. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres: memory versus forgetting, rational demystification, patience over force. Recurring images (geese pause/resume, hush, fountains) reweight at the end. The explicit line “proving magic was just reality misunderstood” overstates what the images already carry, slightly muting subtext. Still, the final image of revived fountains offers resonant, earned meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of cyclical fate, ethical illumination versus destructive zeal, and entropy are embedded in action and motif (gear approximating infinity, bioluminescent guidance). The ending reframes the loop motif into the possibility of divergence without sermonizing. A touch of explicit statement (“to share light without using fire”) edges toward telling, but most resonance arises from image and choice. The conceptual aftertaste is clean and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—grief as communal, woven ritual—emerges organically from images and action (ribbon, migration, poem‑trading) and reweights in the ending. The mentor’s lines verge on articulation (“grief is not carved; it is woven”), but they’re dramatized through the ritual and carving choice, not tacked on as moral. The final whisper (“Trade your poems with the dead…”) risks explicitness yet resonates as a charged directive that reframes the craft. Subtext persists in the butterflies’ clustering as pattern made communal.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: time’s rhythm, confession as craft, and communal harmony. The final image reweights prior motifs (handle inscriptions absorbed by the bob) without sermonizing, though “restore shared balance” verges on explicit statement. Subtext—atonement as integration into communal time—reads cleanly. Resonance lingers with a non-literal answer to guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of remembrance, redemption, and the ethics of intention crystallize through chess, the humming case, and the dawn reprise. The tapestry’s “ECHO” and the grave of forget-me-nots are concrete carriers of meaning rather than abstract assertions. The ending avoids sermonizing, offering a felt repricing of the dead’s intentions. It trends tidy but lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of innovation within constraint and sustaining transformation arise through the lake’s tyranny, predictive modeling, and the poised quill. A few lines verge on thesis (“not by brute force,” “sustaining transformation”) that tell rather than let image and choice carry the weight. The ending image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: commit to a patient, data‑led thaw. Subtext is present in the kingfisher’s clarity and the charged stillness before action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around the resilience of stories and subversion under censorship; dust-as-medium reframes audience and memory. Recurring images (“thistled calm,” “dial glow,” “elusive lyrics”) accrue and reweight at the end. The final tableaux provide a non‑literal answer—art distributes itself through the overlooked—without moralizing. Slight neatness stems from cost‑lite resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (mask, vanishing point, powder) braid to argue that safety is a mirage and beauty inheres in transience, with strong subtext until the final sentence states the thesis. The explicit articulation (“nothing lasts, but in its fleetingness lies wonder”) blunts resonance that the images already earned. Earlier ironies (offering sanctuary through omission) provide thematic depth without sermonizing. The piece nearly achieves a charged poise without the moral line.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: empirical method versus mythic narratives, with the cog reframing meaning from sin or sabotage to tool. The ending offers a resonant stance without sermon—nearly declarative, yet grounded in the object’s presence. The piece invites reflection on how artifacts are conscripted by stories. Slight didactic tint in a couple lines keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic integration is strong: vanishing arts, subtracting noise, and braided voices accrue into a credible meditation on communal unlearning. Subtext lives in images (the rosette “expanding” as hearts open) and the patient method rather than speechifying. A few explicit thesis notes (“the vanishing arts demanded persistence”) verge on telling but do not overwhelm. The ending offers a resonant, earned answer without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pruning as an ethical and neurological metaphor ties action to theme with resonance. “Gentle rebellion” is enacted, not just asserted, and the final image reweights the premise toward communal reclamation. Some thematic statements (“synaptic plasticity” explication) edge into told wisdom. Still, the piece invites reflection without flattening into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme—preserving wonder in routine—emerges through the beehive-tech fusion and the ritualized toll keeper, culminating in the city’s lights rekindled as awe. However, it is underlined a bit overtly via authorial statements of Thorne’s motivation. The final image (“routine resumed— but now, laced with enduring awe”) lands, if somewhat tidy. Subtext exists in the tension between convenience and enchantment but isn’t deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic threads—displacement, absorption of lives, hush—are elegantly braided and the final image reweights the ordinary. However, the thesis is stated outright (“houses felt alive because…”) rather than fully implied, dulling subtext. The work invites reflection but edges toward explanatory moral at the last beat. Strong cohesion, minor over‑articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—certainty versus nuance—emerges clearly through object and image (ampoule, foxglove stain, structural weakness). However, Liriel’s explicit framing (“Welcome the nuance, wanderer”) edges into moralizing, muting subtext. The final image reweights earlier material convincingly. A shade more implication and less thesis would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Regret, chance vs determinism, and the impossibility of perpetual motion braid into a coherent theme. The chipped die and the proof reweight the final image without moralizing. Occasional explicit statements (“recalling the laws of thermodynamics”) lean didactic, but the ending’s ambiguity resists tidy moral closure. Resonance lingers in the charged uncertainty of freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of remembrance, communal generosity, and language as vessel emerge organically through the inscriptions and final dawn gesture. Subtext hums in the linkage between vanished scripts and fragile urban kindness. A few overt thesis lines early name the idea, but the ending reweights it through image rather than moralizing. The final image earns a reflective afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of cultural continuity, communal ritual, and resilience are earned through specific acts (initialed loaves as identity and alliance). The beekeeper’s absence and rosewater dread thread meaningfully into a final image of provisional hope. One line (“We must revive what binds us”) edges toward statement, but most resonance arises from image and deed. The lens motif and bread ritual reweight the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief, time’s reversibility, and the danger within hope emerge from particulars (hunger stone as both omen and fuel; inward lighthouse beam). The final doubt reframes “victory” and reweights the mythos without moralizing. Recurring images (reverse ticking, low tide breath, latent radiance) evolve meaningfully. Resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: exposure versus concealment, with paradox as the operative ethic that transforms fear’s power. Recurring images (luminance, mirrors, the clasp) reweight meaning at the end. A line like “exposure starved it” states the thesis a touch too plainly, trimming subtext. Still, the final image (glow extinguished, night air) resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of transforming threat into art emerges organically from the tactic of “sketched resonance” and the literal repurposing of obstacles. The final harmony reweights the premise without sermonizing, though one or two lines verge on stating the thesis. Subtext—craft as stewardship, listening as control—lingers. The closing image delivers a gentle, resonant answer rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of knowledge versus taboo, surveillance, and living on slumbering power emerge through concrete acts and the scroll’s repricing of the city. The final image reweights the world (watchers stir; turtles may awaken) without moralizing. The reed whistle as patterned language bridges method and meaning. Slightly didactic scroll exposition keeps it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of noble lies, historical erasure, and decay-as-consequence recur through concrete images (ivy, abandoned station). However, several lines state the thesis directly (“not accusatory but revelatory,” “foster a society wary of well-intentioned falsehoods”), thinning subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs, but the moralizing edge blunts ambiguity. Insight feels earned but explained.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, inheritance, and “interlaced absence” emerge organically through objects and acts (inkwell ↔ locket ↔ notes). The final embedding reweights the premise without a stated moral. Occasional explicit naming (“interlaced absence,” “stoically sensitive”) edges toward thesis‑speak, lightly diluting subtext. Overall resonance endures via the charged closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of truth versus myth, refuge over heroism, and stillness as strength arise from particulars (blackout, tactile search, refugee revelation). The final reweighting avoids overt moralizing for most of the piece, though the last lines verge on thesis (“illuminated the city's future”). Subtext lives in the reclaimed stillness motif and the inherited stamp. Resonance lingers but stops short of profound ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of grief transmutation is earned through concrete craft and paradox (descending/ascending) rather than sermonized. The final cranes reweight prior images into a resonant answer: peace that does not erase loss. “Some luminosities burned eternal” offers a clean conceptual toll. One line states the aim directly, but the scene-work carries the load.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Grief-to-renewal, the ethics of potential, and the cost of survival emerge through concrete images (the geode from the wedding, “lives unlived” nodes) and culminate in a non-vengeful vow. The final image reweights earlier material without stating a moral. A middle line explicitly equating anomalies to “what could have been” edges into telling, shaving subtlety. Still, the resonance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    “Missing pieces” and “belonging” integrate across object, action, and outcome; the final image reweights them warmly. Some lines verge on thesis-statement (“I seek the frequency of belonging”), trimming subtext. Still, the chip’s completion refracts the theme effectively without overt moralizing at the end. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres around truth versus mercy, memory as shield, and time’s irreversibility. Motifs (sieving, driftwood, watch hand) reprise effectively to reweight the final stance. A few explicit statements (“not just deceptions; they were shields,” “time couldn’t be rewritten”) tip toward telling and reduce subtext. Nonetheless, the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of neutrality, redemption, and the liminal space “between apology and forgiveness” recur through concrete particulars (the parapet, lunar fairness, crossing prisoners). The drawer pull’s symbolic reweighting works. Some lines verge on stated moral (“true untethering came not from the object”), softening the subtext. Resonance lingers, but subtlety ebbs at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (compass vs. poles, sea shanty, dawn) coherently support themes of reorientation and earned humility. The final image reweights the celestial/terrestrial calculus without sermonizing. A few abstract statements (“Expectations had collapsed…”) flirt with moral summary. Still, resonance lingers via the warm compass in pocket and the counted poles.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of redemption, self‑deception, and self-authored fate accrue through the recurring object and the subterranean setting. The reweighted signature reframes identity and responsibility with a clean logic. However, lines like “a path to redemption” and “empathy kindled” edge into stated moral. The ending image carries resonance but would be stronger with less explicit moral framing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of transformation vs. constancy and love’s cost emerge organically through image (permanent moonlight, steady bloom) and choice (accepting a hybrid self). The fortune risks on‑the‑nose statement but earns its place by reweighting the final surrender. The closing flight reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext hums in how steadiness “anchors” her acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through particulars: family ritual vs. solitary divination, the crack as generational fracture, and the pool of lost moments. The final image (tracing Mira’s imagined hand, vow to renew the custom) reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. Subtext around grief and inheritance hums beneath the ritual acts. A hint of explicitness (“ready to start the custom anew”) trims the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Compassion versus repression, pacifism’s solitude, and integration are rendered through concrete images (tears-as-archives, stitching as healing). Recurrences meaningfully shift by the end (photos become a map; buoyancy becomes passage). One line (“I will not strike”) flirts with thesis-stating but is otherwise earned by the pattern. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Transformation is embodied through the relinquishing of light and the reweighting of “coincidence” into destiny. The final image resonates, but the text occasionally states theme outright (“transformation wasn’t abrupt thunder, but a vibrant hush”), edging toward didactic. Subtext exists in the interplay of hush/power and accident/fate. Thematic integrity is strong though not subtle at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (light/blackout, coded angles, “cradle of sparks”) align with themes of hoarded power versus distributed ingenuity. Some lines tip into telling (“igniting a revolution so quiet…”) rather than earning resonance through image. The final image promises repricing but leans on assertion over felt consequence. Still, the objects-as-code thread gives a satisfying conceptual echo.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of control vs. harmony and obligation vs. self-preservation emerge through particulars (eel-herding method, frictionless physics, the ritual). The final reweighting lands, though one line (“She understood: … not to restore friction, but to embrace the slide”) states the thesis a touch directly. Subtext largely operates in image (borrowed dawn, eels’ loops, dust’s gravity whisper) and lingers post-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: censorship’s scars reimagined as cartography; rage distilled into luminous truth; secrecy as lineage. Recurring images (timer, stormlight, envelope/map) shift meaning by the end to frame a quiet resistance network. One line (“Understand the scars, poet...”) edges toward thesis but is contextualized as mentor’s charge, not authorial sermon. The final act resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—turning questions into destinations and fencing ideas as much as steel—emerges from objects and actions (sundial-as-map, maps as prize). Lines like “Questions are but uncharted maps” verge on thesis-stating, dulling subtext. Still, the final image of maps and the brook’s resumed murmur offers a resonant, non-literal answer about inquiry’s costs and routes. Motifs reprise without feeling token.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars—tin with false bottom, seeds in cracks, prison‑library method—rather than abstract sermonizing. The final image reweights prior motifs (fracture/light, bloom/rot) and offers a resonant answer about making beauty under oppression. A few lines edge toward thesis‑statement clarity (“These weren’t mere keepsakes…”), slightly reducing subtextual power. Still, the legacy‑to‑action continuum lands emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of agency versus destiny and art as revision accrue through particulars (the piano bleeding color into monochrome; the clock mending “tick by tick”). The final image reweights prior motifs without heavy moralizing, though lines like “fate surprised into silence” verge on explicit statement. Resonance lingers via the earned stasis: triumph braided with ongoing loss. Strong, if a touch declarative at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of truth versus illusion and communal memory versus erosion emerge organically from Elara’s praxis (“empirically whimsical”) and the seed’s activation. The final image reweights prior material: luminous doubt is reframed as a disciplined stance that must be maintained under storm pressure. The dream litany risks mild statement, but it’s earned by the ritual context and avoids moralizing. Resonance lingers without resolving ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motifs (pruning, tides, compass, color) braid into a coherent meditation on regret and ritualized repair. The final image reweights earlier material (cerulean becomes named, then externalized in the sea at sunset) without overt moralizing. Some lines edge toward explicit thematizing (“Diffuse the ache by naming its hue”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, resonance lingers with credible ambiguity: the tides will return.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core theme is potent and original, but its resonance is significantly undermined by overt authorial statements. The line "The butterfly wing dust had preprocessed her own reality..." explains the central metaphor directly, a thematic echo that sacrifices subtext for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming hardship into art is potent but is undermined by being explicitly stated. The note ("In the pauses, find your light...") and Elara's subsequent conclusion state the theme directly, functioning as a "thematic echo" that preempts earned resonance. This final-paragraph moralizing prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story’s powerful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of art and emotion as forces of resilience emerges organically from the plot and imagery, particularly the "unshaken marvels." The resolution offers a resonant answer to the problem of silence without resorting to a simplistic moral. The final line, "turning survival into symphony," is slightly too explicit, a thematic summary that slightly undermines the power of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transforming turmoil into peace is well-integrated with the plot, and the mending of the lens is a strong resonant image. However, the story leans on repeating key phrases like "chased stillness" and "permanent address" almost as thematic labels. The final paragraph risks overstating the theme ("stillness no longer fled—it lingered, eternal and profound") rather than allowing the final image to carry the resonance alone.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of intergenerational support emerges powerfully through action and imagery for most of the story. However, the climax and conclusion suffer from thematic overstatement. Elias's speech explicitly declares his motive ("I did this to build intergenerational support..."), and the final paragraphs summarize the theme directly. This "thematic echo" replaces the earned resonance of the story's images with a less potent moral, weakening the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of reclaiming love and healing past trauma emerges organically from the story's central metaphor of the "pilgrim of sparks." The final image of the fog lifting provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. However, the thematic expression sometimes verges on being too explicit, with phrases like "healing through revealing" and the neatness of the final emotional state ("Elara felt whole") slightly undercutting the potential for lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of obsession and the cost of knowledge emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex resolution where discovery is intertwined with loss. The final image of Elias ready to design a new maze that incorporates his hard-won, "rough" knowledge provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial quest, reweighting his entire purpose as a designer.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of patient resilience versus destructive greed emerges organically from the central conflict over the seed vault. The final image of "green shoots piercing the arid earth" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question about the future. The theme is well-integrated, though some of the prose verges on stating it directly rather than letting it emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is woven into the story's DNA through the central conceit of "collecting absences." The piece explores loss, memory, and healing not through statement but through a powerful, resonant metaphor enacted on the page. The final image provides a complex and non-literal answer to the story's core question, suggesting the possibility of new growth from voids without lapsing into a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of reinterpreting one's fate emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the final image of the portrait as a "talisman of change." The story uses its central motifs (light, codes, illuminated moments) to explore this theme without resorting to overt moralizing. The final line, "her savvy mind now tuned to destiny’s subtle door," comes close to a thematic statement but is saved by its connection to the story's opening motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent and integrated but lacks subtlety due to overt authorial explanations. The line "The core concept of his work mirrored his inner journey: the thawing heart" is a Thematic Echo that explicitly states the central metaphor, undermining the power of subtext. While the final image resonates, these moments of direct explanation treat the theme as a thesis statement rather than an emergent property of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story's theme is powerful, but its execution is undermined by a complete lack of subtext. The theme of "vulnerability is power" is explicitly stated as motivation, a weapon, and is summarized in a final-sentence moral. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern replaces earned resonance with a thesis statement, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in absence and preserving memory through art is seamlessly integrated into every element of the story. The core concept of an "ambered hush" emerges organically from the character's actions and the story's imagery, never feeling stated or imposed. The final image provides a complex, non-literal answer to the threat of oblivion, leaving a lasting resonance without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of consciousness arising from accumulated experience is gracefully woven through the narrative. The violin playing serves as a powerful, non-literal exploration of this idea. However, the story falters slightly at the end by explicitly stating its conclusion ("Thoughts, Eko realized, came from convergence..."), which verges on thematic summary and slightly diminishes the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme is coherent, its delivery is overwhelmingly explicit, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative repeatedly states its intentions ("transparency was the key," "thawing the mistrust") and culminates in a summary statement: "The core concept crystallized: freed by honesty." This thematic echo fundamentally weakens the story's literary quality by replacing resonant imagery with a declarative moral.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of patient craft versus arbitrary metrics emerges powerfully from the story's particulars, especially through the central motif of the "mended deception." However, the story falters at the climax by stating its theme directly: "'This garden knows its gardener...'" This on-the-nose declaration acts as a thematic echo, undermining the subtext that had been built so carefully and preventing a more resonant, implicit conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of discovery's cost is well-integrated, emerging organically from the plot. The parallel between the creatures' "subdued awakenings" and Elara's own dawning realization of the danger is a strong touch. The final image of shared coffee avoids moralizing, offering a resonant moment of connection in the face of a newly understood, vast mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding meaning in ruin and listening to the "in-between spaces" emerges powerfully from the central imagery. The final image of the resolved hush provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The score is slightly tempered by moments of thematic over-articulation, as when Elias's epiphany ("the in-between spaces were key...") is stated directly, bordering on a Thematic Echo that momentarily lessens the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of confronting and quantifying hidden grief emerges organically from the story's particulars. The central concepts ("swaying certainties," "occupying margins") are integrated directly into the climatic action, avoiding preachiness. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal resolution, though the repeated use of key thematic phrases like "auroral sorrow" slightly overstates the case instead of letting the image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of confronting buried historical and personal trauma is coherent and emerges organically from the story’s core elements. The final image of the water washing away dust provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as describing the valve wheel as a "symbolic, a key to unlocking the mill's haunted past," which verges on authorial explanation rather than allowing meaning to emerge purely from scene.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of detached observation versus cyclical decay emerges organically from the story's imagery and structure. The final image of the keeper returning to his vigil offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion that avoids a simple moral. The piece successfully explores its central question through atmosphere and recurring motifs rather than direct authorial statements.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" is woven throughout, but its power is diminished by being overtly stated multiple times. Lines like "magic wasn't in grand spells but in the subtle links" and Elara's dialogue during the eclipse function as thematic summaries. This direct explanation replaces the subtextual resonance that the powerful final images could have carried on their own, representing a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory, hope, and the endurance of stories is elegantly woven through the story's central images and concepts. The final image of hope stirring in the quiet offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the world's despair, earned through the preceding discoveries. The theme feels organic, avoiding simple moralizing, though a few direct restatements of motivation slightly flatten the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of "open secrets" and restorative truth is coherently integrated into the plot and imagery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, but the overall execution is overly sentimental, resolving complex human issues into a tidy moral that lacks the ambiguity and nuance required for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of challenging assumptions and finding strength in silence emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with the final looped phrase: "in stillness unraveled, assumptions fall; in silence decorated, clarity calls." This acts as a thematic summary, a stated moral that slightly diminishes the resonance of the final, quieter moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of reconciling with the past to create the future emerges organically from the story’s central images of spirals and reflections. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the character's dilemma. The concluding fortune, "In spirals of memory, conduct the dawn," verges on a direct thematic statement, but because it is a diegetic creation, it functions as a successful, if not subtle, flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is skillfully woven through the story's central conceit, exploring self-acceptance and the nature of freedom without resorting to moralizing. The repeated failure to find a perfect past powerfully argues that resolution lies not in rewriting history but in confronting its origin. The final image of Elara touching the ground provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her struggle, a potent symbol of her newfound, fragile humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme emerges organically from the story’s unique premise, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the last few paragraphs verge on thematic summary, using phrases like "shattered numbness" and "victory over emotional numbness." This slight over-explanation undermines the subtext that the rest of the story so carefully builds.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic exploration of truth, integrity, and solitude is handled with impressive subtlety, emerging organically from character and choice rather than statement. The story resists a simple moral, validating the protagonist's difficult choice while acknowledging its cost. The final image of the quiet courtyard under a threatened sky provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of memory and scent is central, its execution is marred by overt thematic statements. The mother's inscription ("Memories are scents we cannot escape...") and Elias's subsequent realization explicitly state the story's thesis, undermining the subtext and failing to trust the reader to connect the powerful images provided.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of choice, time, and selfhood is sophisticated and emerges organically from the story's central images—the rope, the layers, the patterns. The narrative avoids any moralizing. The final image of Elias vanishing into the grotto offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly embodying his choice to prioritize the human process of seeking over a final, alien answer.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding beauty in the unfinished is woven through every element of the story with masterful coherence. The final image of the violinist joining the echoes provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the protagonist's direct vow, "I vow to embrace the unfinished," which borders on a thematic statement that could have been left implicit in the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of elevating imperfection into wholeness is resonant and well-integrated. However, a few lines veer into direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful emergence of meaning, particularly the explicit explanation in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" is a significant weakness due to its overt and repetitive statement. The narrative explicitly moralizes in several places, most notably when Elias shares "how such silent acts formed cycles of compassion." This is a classic example of "Thematic Echo," where the story's thesis is stated directly rather than emerging organically from subtext and action, significantly undermining its literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story's theme—that connection is forged through shared vulnerability, transforming pain into strength—is coherent and well-developed. The final image of the obsidian arbor is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back slightly by the repetitive use of key phrases like "luminescent ache" and "webs of kinship," which occasionally veer close to stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of art's role in creation and preservation emerges organically from the plot. Elara, an illustrator, must engage with the source of sound to save her world, literally sculpting a solution. The final image of "harmony reigned, sculpted by her hand" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion that reweights her identity as an artist without any overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding patterns in emotional chaos is beautifully integrated into the plot and character. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, avoiding a tidy moral. The story's strength is its embrace of complexity, but it is docked slightly for moments where the theme is articulated a bit too directly, as in the statement of his motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of caching hope and presence is elegantly woven throughout the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image. The parallel between caching the tape and Elias caching himself is powerful. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement: "...his long seclusion... had been a self-imposed cache, hiding his light until the moment it could illuminate another's path." This moment of telling dilutes the otherwise excellent emergent theme.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of adaptation through surrender emerges organically from the plot, powerfully supported by plant metaphors. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("reminded her daily of the beauty in yielding..."), explicitly stating the moral instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own. This direct moralizing at the end weakens an otherwise subtle thematic development, triggering a Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning through connection rather than isolation emerges organically from the plot. The final exchange provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's quest. However, the score is capped by the story's tendency to state its theme via conceptual labels like "unearthed convergence" and the repeated phrase "thresh meaning." This borders on Thematic Echo, slightly undermining the subtext by making it overly explicit in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme exploring the limits of foresight versus the magic of possibility is well-integrated and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of her eyes glowing with "bright darkness" is a resonant, non-literal answer to this question. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic overstatement, such as "...teaching her that true magic lay in the unknown," which state the moral directly instead of trusting the scene to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of healing through shared narrative is coherent and emerges from the story's events. The trumpet valve is a strong central motif that accrues meaning. The score is limited by the story's tendency to state its themes directly, especially near the end with lines like "compiling our pains into purpose" and "forged a future from its absences." This explicit moralizing undercuts the resonance of the final image by explaining it to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of confronting avoidance is coherent but delivered with overwhelming explicitness, violating the principle of emergence. Key thematic phrases ("bad habits," "unspoken truths," "unraveling mysteries") are repeated so often that they become slogans. The confession ("I hid from the truth of loss, mapping escapes instead of facing pain") acts as a direct thesis statement, leaving no room for subtext or reader discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of reconciling memory, grief, and belief is explored with nuance and avoids easy answers. The "unheard symphony" motif masterfully connects the internal, terrestrial, and cosmic elements. The ending resonates powerfully, though a few phrases like "kindness her truest guide" verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thematic exploration of endings and immortality is strong, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simple moral. The vision of "separations birthed connections" provides a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme's delivery is slightly undercut by the repetitive, on-the-nose use of keywords like "intrigue," which occasionally feels like authorial signposting rather than organic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of balancing deceit with justice is central and consistently explored. The ink pot as a tool that liquefies rigidity is a potent, if unsubtle, metaphor for bending rules for a higher good. The primary flaw is the ending's tendency toward moralizing. Stating that "the scales finally even" and Alex's "honesty intact" provides a tidy answer to a complex question, replacing resonant ambiguity with a declarative statement that lessens the story's thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story develops its themes of memory, preservation, and purpose with subtlety and depth. The central question evolves from how one preserves the past to what responsibility one has to the present. The final realization provides a resonant, non-literal answer, transforming "invented histories" from a passive art into a potential tool for liberation, an insight earned entirely through the story’s events.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of erased histories and self-created identity is powerfully developed through recurring images and collected stories. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext. Lines like "envisioned the core concept of erased histories as a vast, invisible web" and the final paragraph's summary ("Erased histories, once voids, now pulsed with discovered textures") are too explicit for the highest tier of literary execution.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of embracing transience is clear, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The story succumbs to Thematic Echo, explicitly stating its conclusions in lines like "the riddle wasn't in permanence, but in embracing the ephemeral" and the final sentence. This direct moralizing undermines the power of the central images and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of community and art as resistance to corporate gentrification emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the united crowd at the mural provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is tempered by the final sentence, which verges on stating the theme directly ("...proving that even afloat on uncertainty, foundations could be rebuilt"), slightly undermining the otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preserving fragile beauty in a technologically saturated world is potent and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. The final sentence, "The image would remind others...urging them to cherish the fading quiet," is a critical flaw, replacing resonant imagery with a stated moral and significantly weakening the story's final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding guidance through unconventional means is organically woven into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Mira’s line, "you've anchored our hopes," functions as a "thematic echo" that states the moral directly, reducing the resonance that the powerful final image could have carried on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story successfully develops themes of discovery, cartographic obsession, and the tension between empirical knowledge and legend. The core concept of a "singular convergence" is well-integrated, elevating the physical quest into a metaphysical one. The final image of Elias on the ice provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions, avoiding a simplistic moral while embracing the ambiguity of his journey.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of harmony and renewal through persistent, subtle action emerges organically from the central conceit. The final image of the revived town provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of discord. However, the story occasionally lapses into thematic summary, particularly in Thorne's murmured maxim, "Balance in beats, revival in echoes," and the final paragraph's explicit statement of his legacy, which slightly undermines the subtextual power of the preceding actions.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of capturing transient beauty in the face of oblivion is elegantly woven through the narrative. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the central conflict to pose a question about what is worth dying for. The final image of Elara embracing her "solitary triumph" provides a resonant, non-literal answer, re-contextualizing her impending death not as failure, but as the ultimate price for her profound goal.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of escaping a legacy of lies is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, frequently resorting to direct thematic statements ("rebuild truth from scraps," "narrative unmarred by deceit"). Key conceptual phrases are repeated verbatim, functioning more like prompt labels than organic motifs. The final resonant image is strong, but it's undermined by the lack of subtext and the over-articulation that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of love, sacrifice, and debt across time emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of the restored orchard offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered because key emotional concepts like "mournful elation" are explicitly stated multiple times, bordering on thematic labels rather than purely emergent feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of mending and rebirth is central and coherent, but its delivery is too explicit, particularly in the final paragraph. The line "broken precedents could indeed sew ruin into reverence" functions as a thesis statement, replacing resonant imagery with a direct moral. This thematic telling diminishes the subtext and prevents the story from inviting deeper, more ambiguous reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of cyclical restoration and finding life in death emerges powerfully from the story’s central imagery. The sundial and orchard are potent symbols that develop organically. The piece narrowly avoids a higher score due to a slight tendency toward thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("...wove her story into the orchard's tapestry"), which borders on explaining the resonance that the final image already achieves more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic integration is superb, with the central juxtaposition of analog and digital, past and future, woven into every facet of the narrative without overt moralizing. The theme emerges organically from character, setting, and action. The final image of chalk whispers being the "true codes" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions about meaning and resistance, achieving a profound and lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of hidden wisdom and the power of forgotten narratives emerges organically from the plot, avoiding any didacticism. The central concept is beautifully integrated with the story's meaning. The final image of Elara resuming her foolish facade offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, with the line "it might yet echo into silence" providing a perfectly pitched thematic close.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of unspoken apologies and the cost of emotional armor emerges organically from the story’s central ritual. The climax, visualizing the "unsent letters," is a powerful dramatization of the core concept. The final image of Elara stepping out transformed provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest without resorting to a simplistic moral. The theme is potent and well-integrated into the story's fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is potent but its delivery is severely hampered by overt, declarative statements. The story explicitly states its motivation ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") and the climactic thematic insight ("Wounds grow roots, then flowers"). This replaces subtext with a thesis, violating the principle of emergence and triggering the Thematic Echo penalty, particularly as these statements substitute for earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of rediscovering and sharing veiled history emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Elara waking with inspiration offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial yearning. The piece avoids moralizing, though the line "...realized these joys were not truly lost but merely veiled" borders on stating the theme directly, which slightly reduces the subtextual power of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of preferring questions over answers is woven deeply into the plot's fabric and emerges organically from the character's journey. However, the resonance is slightly blunted by the final line of dialogue ("I believe in the magic that questions create"), which functions as a thematic statement. While earned, this explicit summary borders on moralizing and prevents the ending from landing with the full power of subtextual implication.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of intellectual liberty versus surveillance is explored through a potent and consistent central metaphor of rebellious gardening. The story allows its events and images to carry the thematic weight for the most part. The final line, "they had planted not just a seed, but a revolution, one cryptic bloom at a time," verges on an explicit thematic statement, which slightly reduces its resonance, but the preceding action has earned the sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transforming pain into beauty is central and consistently developed. Unfortunately, it is articulated too directly, with phrases like "photosynthesize pain into beauty" and "blossom armistice" functioning as explicit labels rather than emergent ideas. The final paragraph restates the theme ("pain fully photosynthesized into beauty"), which constitutes a Thematic Echo that undermines the resonance of the closing image by telling the reader what to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, loss, and the bittersweet nature of preservation is woven deeply into the narrative fabric, emerging organically from character and setting. The final image of temporary light against eternal loss provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The repetition of the "foxglove regret" motif verges on being too explicit, narrowly keeping the score from the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of truth mending fractures caused by silence is central and coherent. However, its execution via the "symphonies of truth" is quite literal, externalizing the emotional labor of reconciliation into a magical artifact. This makes the theme feel more stated than explored, leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity. The final image is resonant, but the path to it lacks the complexity of a truly earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of balancing progress and reverence is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Key concepts like "encrypted compassion" and "measured mercy" are stated directly, functioning as thematic labels rather than emergent ideas. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the story's moral, which undermines the power of the preceding imagery and leaves little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of trust, preservation, and finding order in chaos emerge organically from the story’s central images. The final realization that "preservation wasn't about hiding, but sharing" is a powerful thematic resolution. However, the final sentence—"preserving not just songs, but the blooming, withering cycle of trust itself"—is an overt thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonance of the preceding scene, functioning as a "Thematic Echo" that explains the story's point directly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of "necessary distances" sanctifying thresholds is woven throughout the story's core images and emerges organically from the character's quest. The final insight provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the story occasionally verges on stating its theme directly (e.g., "he intuited that these necessary distances...were what sanctified thresholds"), which slightly lessens the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding belonging in a place rather than with people emerges organically from the setting and Elara's unique profession. The final image of the softened feather offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements, such as the repeated phrase "rhythm of belonging." This thematic echo slightly flattens the complexity, stating what the imagery is already effectively showing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story explores its theme of loss and memory with poetic grace, but its method is overly explicit. Key conceptual terms from the prompt ("missing pieces," "conjecture," "cheerful gloom") are used directly in the narration, functioning as thematic labels. The final paragraph, in particular, explains the resolution rather than allowing it to resonate purely through image, which feels like a "thematic echo" that lessens the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of creating art by ordering chaos is central and well-developed through image and action, particularly the bishop as a "symbol of diagonal precision." However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements, such as defining the motivation as "simple yet profound" or summarizing the climax with "...every element...ordered by Elias's unseen hand." This tendency to state the theme directly prevents the work from achieving the highest level of resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory versus enforced forgetting emerges organically from the central conflict and resolves into a potent final image. The story resists a simple moral, offering a complex vision of resistance. The final epiphany ("elective exile was not escape, but a canvas...") verges on being too explicit, but the powerful image of the living monument ultimately carries the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding value in the mundane is central and developed through resonant imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overt thematic statement in the climax: "...one must cherish the mundane, for it held the true pearls of the bay." This Thematic Echo functions as a final-paragraph moral, reducing the power of the otherwise evocative closing images and preventing the theme from emerging purely through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered via direct, on-the-nose statements rather than emerging from subtext. Eli's monologue, particularly the line "Pain isn't just destruction... It's a teacher," functions as a thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. This is a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, undermining the story's potential for resonance by stating its moral explicitly in the climax, leaving little for the reader to interpret.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of hope as a quantifiable, engineered force is elegantly developed through the story’s central metaphor. The final "new calculus" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. The score is slightly limited by a moment of thematic over-articulation near the end ("hope as a function of lucid watchfulness..."), which verges on stating its own thesis directly rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of confronting inherited burdens emerges clearly, but the final two paragraphs state it too directly, functioning as a moral summary. The line "turning the past's burdens into guides for survival" is a classic thematic echo that replaces resonance with explanation. This direct articulation prevents the theme from lingering with the complexity it could have achieved through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring possibility, sacrifice, and the ephemeral nature of creation. The central concept avoids simple morals, and the final image of "possibilities unfolding like spring petals" provides a powerful, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire piece. The resonance is earned and lingers without any authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of “flawed beauty”—the idea that peace and redemption are possible but never pristine—emerges organically from the story’s particulars. It is established in the imagery of the sky and the cracked terrace and resonates powerfully in the final image of Elara’s costly victory. The story successfully avoids moralizing, offering a complex, non-literal answer to its central question.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of redemption and the conflict between greed and preservation emerges powerfully from the central concept. The final image is resonant, but its power is slightly undercut by prose that tends to state the theme directly. Phrases like "a testament to sentiment hidden in greed" and the final "stormy absolution" function as thematic labels, moving from subtext into text and telling the reader the story's meaning rather than fully trusting the images to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of liberation from imposed silence is powerfully integrated into the story's core concept and climax. The "harvest of echoes" serves as a potent metaphor, and the final image of the "whirlwind of awakening" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the character's struggle and the evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of ethical storytelling is central and thoughtfully explored, but its execution is hampered by overt statement. Phrases like "to explore ethical storytelling" and "These shows would be ethical explorations" function as thematic labels that undermine the story's subtext. This direct moralizing, a form of thematic echo, reduces the resonance that should emerge organically from the final image, preventing the theme from achieving true subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of honoring overlooked histories through witness rather than orchestration emerges powerfully from the story's central event. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary, slightly over-articulating its conclusion. Phrases like "a profound realism—an esoteric truth that some harmonies resolve only in silence" dilute the resonant power of the preceding image by explaining it, preventing the piece from achieving perfect thematic subtlety at its close.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story’s central theme of preserving memory through art is potent and culminates in a powerful final image of the names made audible. However, the resonance is significantly undercut by the final sentence, which explicitly summarizes the theme for the reader ("...kindled the ardor of heritage..."). This turn towards moralizing dilutes the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of renewal through the decay of old structures is woven throughout, from the setting to the final revelation. The final image of the parting vines is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. However, the penultimate paragraph veers into overt thematic summary ("discovering that paths chose those ready to let directives decay..."), which slightly undermines the otherwise emergent and earned thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of empirical science versus encrypted devotion is overt and frequently stated. The story culminates in a direct summary of its own meaning: "...the ironic truth that devotion, encrypted and empirical, bound him to the stars eternally." This final-paragraph moralizing replaces resonance with explanation, a significant flaw under the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of releasing resentment is well-integrated with the setting and plot. However, its power is significantly undercut by heavy-handed, explicit statements throughout the narrative. The final paragraph devolves into a direct summary of the moral, "proving that true peace came...", which replaces resonant imagery with overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding wholeness in brokenness and bridging the tangible and ethereal worlds emerges organically from the story’s central images. The broken sextant revealing hidden truths and the mirror capturing a dream are powerful, non-didactic metaphors. The final image offers a resonant, satisfying answer to the story's central question without resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of renewal, impermanence, and accidental wisdom is woven throughout with strong motifs (deciduous vows, mending, quartz). The final image of the fused ribbon is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the story suffers from a significant thematic echo in the final lines, where both the dialogue and narration explicitly state the moral ("accidental wisdom," "wisdom's favorite disguise"), which prevents the piece from achieving true subtlety and costs it dearly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of knowledge, its nonlinear nature, and its price is central and developed through concrete imagery and plot. The final image of Elias curating "nonlinear threads" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial bewilderment. However, a few lines of dialogue, such as "knowledge blooms between the first and last page," verge on explicit thematic statement, slightly reducing the power of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of knowledge, silence, and finding power in overlooked "gaps" emerge organically from the plot. The "unheard symphony" motif is woven through effectively and resonates at the end. However, the final line—"saving not just futures, but the music of possibilities itself"—is a thematic echo that summarizes the story's meaning for the reader, slightly undermining the otherwise strong subtext with a moment of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story's most significant flaw is its repeated and explicit statement of theme using the prompt's vocabulary ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace"). This is a critical failure of "thematic echo," where the narrative explains its own meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from events. The final sentence, in particular, offers a tidy moral summary that replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of translating absence into presence is central, but it's articulated too directly through summary rather than emerging from subtext. The final paragraph acts as a thematic statement, explaining the meaning of the events: "clarity bloomed... confusion translating into a tapestry of revealed history." This overt moralizing ("Thematic Echo") undermines the resonance of the closing image by refusing to trust the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of earned peace versus fragile silence is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating the theme directly. The final two paragraphs, especially the line "Elara understood that the ripple-mark mapkeeper's true map was one of inner landscapes," function as a thematic summary, a heavy-handed moral that lessens the resonance of the preceding imagery. This instance of "Thematic Echo" is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of purpose versus chaos is central and consistently explored. Unfortunately, the story sacrifices subtext for directness, culminating in a final paragraph that explicitly states the moral. The line "coincidences were illusions, each event a deliberate stitch in the tapestry of meaning" is a textbook example of a thematic echo that summarizes the story's point rather than allowing it to resonate through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    A resonant theme of memory's fragility and the historian's creative role emerges organically from the core concept. The final image provides a complex, non-moralizing answer to the story's central question. The score is lowered by the repetition of thematic phrases like "sculpt identity," which occasionally feels like authorial summary rather than pure emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of creating light to defy darkness is seamlessly integrated through recurring imagery of fireworks, blooms, and fire. The final image of a new "cascade of blooming bursts" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem without resorting to a stated moral. While the mosaic's message is explicit, it functions as a catalyst within the narrative rather than an authorial statement, preserving thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of transition and continuity is beautifully integrated through the central metaphors of the tide and the cicada. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image and exchange that provides a non-literal answer to Elara's fear. Kael's final line, "Transitions are like tides...", borders on being a direct statement, but functions effectively as earned wisdom within the dialogue, preserving the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding inner space to overcome outer confinement is woven skillfully through the central metaphor of collecting silences. The final image of the bunker-as-canvas provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The theme's execution is slightly hampered by overt phrasing like "stretch her contracted world," which verges on stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of silence as a balm for grief is woven skillfully through image and action, particularly with the storm glass vial. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, such as "to teach silence how to comfort" and the final line's "vaulting hush reigning supreme." These moments slightly undercut the subtext by explicitly stating what the narrative has already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of merging past and future is consistently woven into the story's imagery and Elara's motivation. The final image of the throne as a "fusion of ornate wood and circuit-veined crystal" is a strong thematic anchor. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit final sentence that summarizes the theme and her quest ("...forever changed by her wisely adventurous quest"), a "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, undermining its potential for resonance. The story doesn't trust the reader, resorting to characters explaining the theme to each other ("this loaded emptiness is not punishment; it's space to inhale"). The final paragraph offers a heavy-handed moral summary, a critical flaw that transforms an evocative story into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transmuting hardship into value emerges organically from the core concept and Elara's motivation. The final image of sharing the diamonds provides a powerful, concrete expression of this idea. Unfortunately, the story's final paragraph resorts to thematic summary, explicitly stating that she was "translating collective pressures into shared wealth" and the magic "had turned her story from ruin to radiance." This direct moralizing undermines the subtext and resonance built through action, explaining the theme to the reader instead of trusting the images to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    The themes of legacy and breaking cycles emerge organically from the plot, and the ending avoids a simplistic moral. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its concepts directly, such as the repeated "eloquently silent" or the explicit explanation of the "bridge of intuition." This over-articulation lessens the resonant power, making the theme feel more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transformation through allegiance to mystical forces is coherent, supported by the central puppetry motif that explores fate and control. However, the resonance is slightly dulled by the repetitive phrasing of key concepts ("murmured allegiance," "capture the shape of possibility"). This repetition borders on thematic statement rather than allowing the theme to emerge solely from the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of magnifying small kindnesses is potent but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story succumbs to a "Thematic Echo" in the final third by explicitly drawing a parallel between the historical artifact and the protagonist's personal life. This direct statement replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, reducing the subtext and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of resistance against systemic indifference is potent and emerges organically from the plot for most of the story. However, the final paragraph resorts to direct thematic summary, stating the story's moral explicitly ("proving that even when plans unravel, resourceful rebels could rewrite the ending"). This robs the final image of its resonant power by over-explaining its meaning, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story beautifully explores themes of absence versus presence, memory, and fate without ever resorting to direct statement. The core concept of silencing a prophecy with a "vested hush" created from "negative space" is a powerful, non-literal exploration of control and quiet defiance. The final image of the hush as a "guardian woven from absence and memory" provides a resonant, thematically rich conclusion that reweights the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of renewal through remembrance is clear and integrated into the plot. However, its execution is too direct, functioning more like a stated moral delivered via folklore than a subtly emergent truth. The final image provides a resonant answer, but the lack of complexity or ambiguity in its presentation keeps it from achieving genuine thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of embracing chaos is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its subtext with overly direct thematic statements. The line "patterns emerged not as chains, but as freedoms" in the final paragraph acts as a stated moral, a "Thematic Echo" that reduces the resonance that the preceding action had already earned so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of repairing brokenness is coherent, it is undermined by overt thematic statements. The final paragraph explains the story's meaning directly ("grasped how names, like kintsugi repairs, could heal..."), which functions as a didactic summary that preempts the resonance of the final image, significantly weakening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of integrating joy into healing is powerfully integrated into the story's core action, particularly the transformation of the crocodile tooth. However, the story undermines its own subtext through overstatement. The final sentence functions as a moral summary ("found peace through joy's gentle pursuit"), and Elara's dialogue explicitly states the central motif ("The ache is luminous"), severely reducing the resonant power that should emerge from implication.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of mercy, trauma, and shared humanity is woven deeply into the narrative's fabric. However, the story falters at the final moment by explicitly stating its theme as a tidy formula: "forgiveness equaled pain divided by time, multiplied by shared humanity." This "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraphs replaces earned resonance with a direct, moralizing statement, significantly weakening an otherwise subtle exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of memory and remembrance is woven deeply into the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image of liberated voices. The story avoids a simplistic moral. However, it leans towards overstating its themes, particularly in the final paragraphs ("where they would no longer be overlooked"), which verges on thematic summary and slightly diminishes the power of the otherwise effective symbolic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of releasing trapped secrets and past traumas is well-integrated with the plot. The final image provides resonance, but the final sentence—"knowing ceilings hid not just dust and relics, but the fragile threads of forgotten lives"—borders on a Thematic Echo. This direct statement of the theme slightly undermines the subtext built through imagery and action, preventing a truly resonant, non-literal conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic exploration of perfection versus imperfection, and the unforeseen costs of obsession, emerges organically from the plot's central conceit. The narrative avoids simplistic moralizing, instead allowing the final image—Elias accepting a new, dynamic role in a flawed world—to serve as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. The theme is fully integrated into the world's mechanics and the character's ultimate transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of history as a malleable, contested narrative is powerfully explored through the central conceit. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's quest. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its themes too directly, particularly in the setup and the final paragraph ("In reimagining one civilization, he had glimpsed redemption..."). This slight thematic over-articulation, a form of Thematic Echo, prevents the theme from emerging purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of restoration through truth and pure intention emerges organically from the plot mechanics. The central concept of "mending what isn't torn" provides a strong thematic core. A minor but distinct flaw is the final paragraph's explicit summary ("a testament to mending the unseen"), which states the theme directly rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in the inexplicable emerges organically from the imagery and plot for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct statement, explicitly summarizing the theme with lines like "she understood her eccentricity as sensibility incarnate—a bridge to the inexplicable." This thematic echo undermines the subtext and resonance built so carefully, replacing an earned, felt understanding with a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of connecting past and present through art is clear, but its delivery is undermined by overt statements. Phrases like "scaffold the complexity of these timewoven alliances with the simplicity of driftwood forms" function as thematic moralizing, replacing subtext with direct exposition. This "thematic echo" significantly reduces the emergent quality of the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and strength in quiet, hidden spaces is potent and well-developed through imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its themes in dialogue-like messages on the postcards and the window. The final reveal, "Flowers bloom at night to teach us that tenderness thrives in umbral spaces," functions as a thematic summary, a significant flaw that replaces earned resonance with a direct moral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of confronting painful historical truths and the tension between betrayal and forgiveness is powerfully integrated. The story avoids a simple moral by culminating in the "FORGIVE TO FREE" bargain—a complex, resonant act rather than a statement. The final image of the lagoon as a "guardian of history's hidden fires" provides a thematically rich and non-literal conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of authentic, effortful creation versus deceptive, empty promises is seamlessly integrated and masterfully resolved. The story resists stating its moral, instead offering a powerful closing image—a real flame in a single lantern—that serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The amber bottle's function as a "metaphor for trapped illusions" is slightly explicit but works within the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of ephemeral emotions having tangible roots and consequences is potent and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with moments of thematic telling, such as identifying the utterance as "an accidental prophecy" or explicitly naming his fears. These moments slightly reduce the resonant power that the final images otherwise so effectively create.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of balancing chaos and order emerges organically from the central conflict and imagery, culminating in a resonant final scene. However, the repeated use of key thematic phrases like "wild serenity" and "furiously tranquil" comes close to stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtextual depth and feeling less discovered by the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "listening over noise" is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or emergent meaning. The final sentence, "true warnings came not from ropes or sirens, but from the quiet art of attention," functions as an explicit moral, a critical flaw. This thematic summary replaces the resonance that should arise from the story's images and actions, feeling instructive rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the theme is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed, suffering from significant "Thematic Echo." The story repeatedly states its core concepts ("flourishing stillness," "strength in vulnerability") instead of allowing them to emerge from subtext. The final paragraphs read like a moral summary, undermining the potential for resonant ambiguity, as in the line: "flourishing stillness enveloped her fully, a core concept she now embodied."

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of preserving unspoken words and finding peace in memory is woven effectively through the story's imagery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The inscription, "For the weights we carry in silence," borders on being an explicit thematic statement but is integrated well enough as a discovery to avoid feeling like a direct authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of rediscovering a lost, intuitive connection to time is woven skillfully through the narrative's imagery and action. The final image of the mended capsule is resonant. The concluding paragraphs, however, veer slightly toward thematic summary ("She had rediscovered the essence... to share with a world adrift"), which slightly diminishes the power of the otherwise implicit and earned thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in the incomplete is woven through every layer of the narrative, from character motivation to the final resonant image. The story powerfully dramatizes its central concept, culminating in a conclusion that avoids moralizing in favor of a complex, earned image. While the initial statement of motivation ("His motivation had always been...") is slightly too direct, the subsequent execution is masterful enough to overcome this minor lack of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of interspecies respect is woven coherently through every element of the story, emerging organically from Elias's actions and the unique setting. The final image of the harmonious orchard serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph drifts toward explicit summary ("stand as a testament to interspecies respect, urging harmony in a world often blind to it"), slightly undermining the earned resonance of the preceding scene with a touch of thematic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of authentic connection emerging from artificial circumstances is explored with nuance and subtlety, primarily through image and action. The fly amber serves as a powerful, resonant motif that grounds the abstract concept in a tangible object. The final paragraph verges on overstating the theme ("convergence wasn't forced but inevitable"), a minor thematic echo that slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise strong, non-literal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of renewal reclaiming a site of destruction is woven seamlessly through the story's imagery, from the seed pods to the final unfurling of underwater flowers. The "submerged concord" concept provides a strong thematic core, and the story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of the battlefield. The theme emerges organically from the particulars of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of bridging distance is potent, but the story relies too heavily on direct statement, creating a "thematic echo." Phrases like "Elara's motivation burned deep: to translate distance into closeness" articulate the theme for the reader rather than letting it emerge from action. While the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, the earlier over-explanation robs it of some of its potential power and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of finding one's "true north" is seamlessly woven through the narrative via the central object, the character's heritage, and the final discovery. The story avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from Elara's actions. The final image of her poised for exploration serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the central question of finding purpose in chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of restoring balance through playful wonder is explicitly and repeatedly stated, rather than emerging organically from the narrative. Lines like "I amend not to steal your game, but to restore its sacred play" function as direct authorial moralizing, a critical flaw under the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern. This over-reliance on telling the theme robs the story of subtext and prevents the final image from resonating with earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic integration is superb and sophisticated. The central idea of validating "small gestures" is woven through character, object, and action, culminating in a powerful, non-literal final image. The pawnless chessboard is a masterclass in recurring motifs, shifting from a symbol of loss to a stage for reclamation, allowing the theme to emerge organically and resonate without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of memory, trauma, and identity is explored with nuance and depth, culminating in a resonant and non-obvious conclusion. The redefinition of "home" from a physical place to a "network of souls, talents blooming" is a sophisticated thematic turn. The final image provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any moralizing and leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of self-forgiveness and learning from failure emerges organically from the central metaphors. The final image of Elias being free to teach again provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally veers into thematic summary, particularly with lines like "decoded messages of compassion... winnowing away the guilt" and the final paragraph's slightly too-explicit statement that his mistake is "no longer a chain but a lesson." These moments slightly blunt the subtext by stating what was already effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of truth's multiplicity as the path to forgiveness is potent and ingeniously explored through the central metaphor of refraction. While a few lines verge on stating the theme too directly, the story overwhelmingly succeeds by dramatizing the concept through action. The final line, "One truth becomes legions, and I am free," is a resonant and complex thematic crystallisation that avoids a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of kintsugi—exalting flaws to create strength—is masterfully integrated into the core action, avoiding direct statement for most of the story. The final image of the radiant statue is a powerful, resonant answer to the central question. However, the last sentence ("enchanting dire peril into enduring purpose") functions as a thematic summary, a minor but clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern that slightly over-articulates the point.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of overcoming a past that has become a prison is coherent. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its central theme in the climax: "...the truth... that his nostalgia was a chain, and freedom lay in embracing the temporary eternity of each new dawn." This thematic echo replaces resonant subtext with a direct moral, significantly reducing the story's literary power and earning a substantial penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "whispers travel farther than shouts" is clear and integrated into the plot. However, it's handled with little subtlety, culminating in a final paragraph that essentially states the moral: "he knew whispers indeed traveled farther." This thematic summary replaces the resonance that a more ambiguous or image-driven ending might have provided, feeling more like a fable's lesson than a complex literary exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of healing through confrontation is masterfully handled via the central concept of "reverse migration." The narrative avoids didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the character's actions and the story's unique physics. The final image offers a complex, resonant answer to the problem of loss without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding safety and order amidst chaos is well-integrated with the plot and setting. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final paragraph with an explicit thematic statement: "her rational foraging now a metaphor for harvesting peace from chaos." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, dulling the impact of the otherwise strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story explores compelling themes of isolation and memory, and the Edelweiss is an effective central motif. Unfortunately, the execution is marred by thematic statements that undermine subtext. The final paragraphs explain the story's meaning directly ("he was now the guardian of this fractured tale"), a critical flaw that prevents the theme from emerging organically through the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of accepting one's past and choices emerges organically from the plot without a single line of moralizing. The final image of Elias returning to his maps with "fresh eyes" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial loneliness. The transformation of the "lingering promise" from a burden to a balm is a nuanced and powerful thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully develops themes of trust versus deception and intuition versus authority without resorting to overt statements. The central conflict between Elara's dreams and her council's warnings provides a strong thematic engine. The final image of "disenchantment forged into resolve" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, re-contextualizing the "bleeding starlight" from a terrifying omen into a source of dangerous, empowering truth.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transforming love through a blend of scientific precision and poetic passion is coherent and well-integrated. However, the story leans too heavily on direct thematic statements, undermining subtext. Lines like "Our friendship was the shell; now, let's spiral into something more" and the final sentence, "witnessing their scientifically romantic dawn," function as overt summaries rather than allowing meaning to resonate solely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story explores its themes of mortality, memory, and the role of the narrator with nuance, avoiding a simplistic moral. The final image of inscribing the scroll provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's crisis. The theme's emergence feels organic, though its power is slightly diluted by the repeated use of the story's core conceptual labels, which occasionally feels like authorial summary rather than purely emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in ordinary objects is potent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Mira's final confession ("...she always said ordinary things hold miracles, like this screw that birthed lives and now measures them") is a textbook "Thematic Echo," stating the story's thesis directly to the reader. This moment of telling, rather than showing, significantly undermines the resonant power of the final image and feels less like an organic discovery and more like a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of transforming trauma into narrative strength emerges organically from the plot, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The final image of scars becoming narrative runes is a brilliant, resonant answer to the story's central question. The subtextual contrast between formal, scholarly magic and personal, superstitious ritual adds a satisfying layer of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme suffers significantly from a lack of subtlety, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at critical moments. The core concept of "imperfect miracles" is explicitly stated multiple times, and the final paragraph devolves into a direct summary of the story's moral ("urging them to reconnect before the axes fell"). This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy, didactic conclusion, undermining the powerful ambiguity established in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of unity versus illusion is central and consistently developed. However, it is articulated too directly, bordering on thematic summary. The dictionary's definition of "illusion" explicitly states the story's premise ("spiraling from misperception to revelation"), which reduces the space for subtext and reader discovery. While the final image is resonant, the theme feels more asserted than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme is potent and well-integrated through imagery like "razor edges," the ending suffers from a "Thematic Echo." Lines like "clocks measured not time, but the cuts it made" and the final sentence state the theme too explicitly. This replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial explanation, undercutting the subtext built so carefully throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of letting go as a form of strength is potent but over-articulated, undermining subtext. Lines like "she realized the true intrusion wasn't external—it was within her" state the theme directly rather than letting the events imply it. This thematic echo, where characters and plot points explicitly name the core idea, verges on moralizing and reduces the resonance that a more subtle approach would have achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the theme of reconciling order and chaos is intelligently woven throughout, the final paragraph succumbs to thematic summary. The line "chance was neither enemy nor savior, but a path to traverse with eyes wide open" is a Thematic Echo that explicitly states the story’s moral. This diminishes the resonance of the final image by replacing earned subtext with a tidy, declarative statement.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of endings creating new beginnings is central and coherent, but its execution lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly states its theme in declarative sentences, such as "to teach endings how to begin" and "every goodbye was a hello in disguise." This thematic echoing, especially the summarizing final paragraph, replaces earned resonance with overt moralizing, significantly weakening the piece's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preserving memory against oblivion emerges powerfully through the central ritual. The final image of the ink-steeped photo offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about loss. However, the piece occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, with phrases like "preserve the weight of small moments" and "regenerated covenant" functioning as labels that could have been left implicit, slightly reducing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme—that connection forged through reciprocal vulnerability is the cure for loneliness—emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final realization ("the cure wasn't in the rock alone, but in the reciprocity it demanded") functions as a sharp Conceptual Repricing rather than a didactic statement. The concluding image of a "network stronger than any disaster grid" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding tranquility amidst overwhelming sensory and emotional noise is masterfully handled. The core concept of the “stillpoint” serves as a powerful, non-literal anchor for the emotional journey, emerging organically from the story’s events. The ending resonates with earned acceptance, avoiding any stated moral and allowing the final image to carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of refining the past to learn from it is clear but delivered too explicitly. The final paragraph articulates the story's moral ("She had edited history, not to forget, but to learn"), an instance of thematic summary that preempts resonance. The core concept is integrated, but the lack of complexity or ambiguity in the resolution results in a tidy message rather than a lingering thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of translating absence into art is potent and deeply integrated into the plot. The method of "mapping silence" is a brilliant dramatization of this theme. The story loses some points for the final paragraph, which verges on summarizing the theme explicitly ("disrupting forgetfulness by mapping silence into music..."). This slightly undermines the otherwise elegant "show, don't tell" approach that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central theme, exploring destruction as a form of preservation, is skillfully woven into the plot and character arc. The final image of the "arsonist's fire" becoming a "guardian's warmth" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. While effective, some of the phrasing throughout feels slightly too direct in its thematic articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict between sterile science and organic connection, memory and presence. The story avoids moralizing, instead crystallizing its central question in the final image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—that the nature of a connection may be less important than the act of reaching for it—which reweights the entire piece beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of subtlety versus brute force is powerfully demonstrated through the central conflict. The story's events serve as a strong allegory for this idea. Unfortunately, the final paragraph resorts to stating the theme directly ("whispers, like folded secrets, traveled farther, reshaping the maze of life itself"), an explicit moralizing that undermines the subtext built through action. This thematic echo in the final lines significantly reduces the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    A powerful central metaphor of finding light in darkness is developed through specific, memorable imagery. The final image of real stars mirroring the man-made ones provides excellent resonance. However, the score is capped because the story repeatedly undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its theme, as in "his motivation clear in the intent: to teach darkness the value of stars," which feels like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of choice versus predestination is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally veers into telling the theme directly, particularly in the final paragraph. Phrases like "a prophecy of their own—one of choice, not predestination" and the concluding sentence summarize the message, slightly undermining the resonant power of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of freedom's true, wild nature versus imposed serenity is explored with nuance and depth. It avoids simple moralizing, emerging organically from Elara's choice and Marek's sacrifice. The final image of her transformation offers a resonant, complex answer to the story's central question, leaving the reader with a powerful feeling of bittersweet triumph rather than a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The themes of manufactured joy, suppressed sorrow, and moral compromise are woven seamlessly into the narrative. The central ritual serves as a powerful metaphor. However, one sentence—"In this emotional void... Elias's performances were a morally ambiguous balm..."—veers close to summarizing the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of art dissolving boundaries is present but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on direct statement and repetition of keywords. Subtext is minimal, and the story culminates in a "Thematic Echo," where the protagonist composes a verse that explicitly summarizes the story's thesis. This replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, undermining the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is potent and well-integrated into the plot's central reversal. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements in the final paragraphs, such as "his heart awakened not to colors, but to the profound acceptance of his own bartered truth," which feels like a summary moral instead of earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection is explored with nuance, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image (the "golden shadow") that beautifully recontextualizes an earlier detail. The piece avoids a simplistic moral. However, a few moments of direct thematic statement, such as the description of her motivation and the final sentence, slightly flatten the subtlety, reading like authorial summary rather than emergent discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of renewal is central and powerfully conveyed through the story's core conceits. However, the execution is marred by thematic echo. The dialogue, particularly Elias’s line "teach your withering heart to bloom," and the story's final sentence explicitly state the theme, undermining the resonance of the final image and replacing subtext with a direct moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the core conceit, exploring patterns of collapse and redemption without resorting to moralizing. The final image of Elara preparing for the next seeker provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The line "This is reverse engineering at its essence" borders on a thematic statement, but it functions adequately as a moment of clarification within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of the beautiful, painful nature of memory and knowledge is explored with nuance and depth, avoiding any simple moralizing. The concept of "anguished joy" is not just stated but earned through the story's events. The final image provides a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry, embodying the theme in a single, poignant moment of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of integrating regret to preserve hope emerges organically from the plot, avoiding any direct moralizing. The concept of "luminous regret" is woven through imagery, from the blooming petals to the shadow's glow to Elara's final emotional state. The final image of the transformed shadow as a "guardian entity" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving the reader with a complex and earned emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of rebuilding after betrayal is central and powerfully rendered through the chameleon metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line "to balance self-respect and compassion" functions almost as a thesis statement, reducing the emergent quality of the theme. This directness prevents the piece from fully trusting its images to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of re-contextualizing trauma is potent and emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph delivers a thematic summary ("true closure came not from sealing wounds, but from embracing their tales") that feels too explicit. This moment of telling slightly undermines the powerful resonance that was already achieved through image and action, preventing the theme from landing with maximum subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of memory, love, and potential emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor of the projection booth and the film strip. The piece avoids easy moralizing, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial quest. The ending reframes "goodbyes" as "new beginnings," a sophisticated thematic turn that reweights the entire narrative without being explicitly stated as a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of cosmic connection is central and coherent, its delivery is too explicit for top-tier literary fiction. The narrative repeatedly states the core concept ("remembered stardust... was the key") instead of allowing it to emerge solely through image and action. This direct thematic articulation, especially the line explaining its function, feels like an authorial intrusion that preempts reader discovery and flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of cultivating hope from brokenness emerges organically from the story's imagery and action, particularly the "fractured lullaby." The final image of saplings growing from glowing blooms offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without resorting to moralizing. The piece achieves a complex emotional aftereffect that is both hopeful and melancholic, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of synthesizing mechanical logic with natural intuition is woven beautifully through the narrative, emerging organically from the setting and character arc. The final image of Elias, "sovereign in his philosophy," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his quest without resorting to moralizing. The concept of "probable miracles" serves as an elegant thematic anchor for the story's tone and events.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding courage through patient, indirect means emerges organically from the story's imagery and actions. While powerful, the theme is occasionally articulated too directly, as in Mira's dialogue ("You seek what lies unused within...") and the final sentence's summary. This slightly lessens the impact of the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of safety versus voice is central and coherent, but its execution lacks subtlety. The story explicitly states its own symbolism in the final third ("The bolt... symbolized the fragile mechanisms holding safety together"). This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern undermines the resonance of the closing images by replacing emergent meaning with a direct authorial explanation, preventing the theme from landing with full force.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of subtle truth eroding grandiose falsehood emerges organically from the plot mechanics rather than being stated. The central motifs—drift, sundering, and shifting constellations—are woven through the narrative, accumulating meaning that pays off in a thematically resonant climax. The final image of the eternal vigil provides a powerful, non-didactic answer to the story's central question about the cyclical nature of this struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of scientific atonement and hidden truths is powerfully embodied in the central image of submerged paths. The story largely allows this to emerge organically. However, the final line's clarity is slightly marred by the explicit statement "to map redemption," which verges on summarizing the theme rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of finding purpose in stagnation is clear, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The story explicitly states its thematic conclusions, such as "the lull was not defeat but a gathering storm," which functions as a Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with direct summary. The final image is strong, but its power is diluted by the preceding over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of evolving tradition is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement, especially at the end. The final paragraphs summarize the theme ("her insurgency birthing a tradition reborn," "tradition evolved with intent") rather than letting the final image of Elara with the child resonate on its own. This thematic moralizing significantly undercuts the subtext and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of grounding hope in the reality of pain is beautifully rendered through the story’s central images: the garden, the ruined lighthouse, the photo, and the pearl. The final action of placing the pearl beside the photograph provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back slightly by lines that explicitly state the theme, like "to anchor optimism in realism," which are efficient but less powerful than the dramatized imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of creation through destruction is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand that undermines its potential resonance. The story repeatedly summarizes its own meaning through the protagonist's rhetorical questions, culminating in a final sentence that explicitly states the theme ("What is art...if not a rhetorical question posed to the void?"). This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern replaces an earned, resonant image with a philosophical thesis statement, significantly reducing subtext and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of perception versus reality in crisis is skillfully woven through the central metaphor of the disappearing ink. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext in the climax by providing a direct, almost scientific explanation for the phenomenon. This moment of telling ("the why: a neural surge...") borders on a "thematic echo," slightly reducing the resonance that a more imagistic resolution might have offered.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of truth versus enforced ignorance is clear but handled with a heavy hand. The narrative relies on repeating the exact phrase "contraband truths" and "unspoken conversation," which reads like thematic labeling rather than organic emergence. The final image, where the "dizzying quiet" becomes "charged with possibility" and "dizzying hope," offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion, but the journey there is hampered by overt thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of creating continuity from wreckage is central and resonant in the final image. However, the story suffers from overt thematic statements, a form of "thematic echo," such as explicitly stating the motivation "to weave continuity through chaos." This direct explanation undermines the subtext and trusts the reader too little, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the particulars alone.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of choosing ephemeral communion over tangible possession emerges organically from the story's central action, culminating in the powerful, non-moralizing choice to release the echo. The final image of Eron fishing on provides a resonant answer to the story's central question, transforming the initial motivation into a deeper understanding. The text trusts its imagery to convey meaning without resorting to overt statements.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of truth and regret is developed with nuance and sophistication, anchored by the brilliant "orbits of regret" metaphor. The story resists a simple moral, instead exploring the complex act of trading one painful narrative for another. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, re-framing regret as something that can be redirected, not just escaped.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of resolving trauma by re-contextualizing the past is powerfully integrated into the story's core concept. The final image of the glowing tattoos creating a "hush" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial problem of "dissonance." The story loses some points for the daughter's translated forgiveness ("I understand, Mama. Rest."), which feels overly tidy and sentimental, slightly simplifying the emotional complexity it had built.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding shared humanity in collective struggle emerges organically from the central metaphor of the mandala. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with moments of overt explanation. The final sentence ("the beauty of connection born from chaos, whispered truths amplified...") is a direct thematic summary that lessens the resonance of the final image, constituting a "Thematic Echo" flaw at the crucial closing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is undermined by its overt and repetitive statement. Phrases like "revolution through kindness," "cradle empathy in arms of steel," and "aberrant mercy" are used as labels that replace subtext. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral, a critical flaw ("Thematic Echo") that prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of hope being rekindled by memory and possibility is coherent and emerges from the central magical event. However, its delivery borders on the explicit, particularly with Silas's line "See how possibilities linger." The final sentence functions as a thematic statement that summarizes the moral, which undercuts the resonance of the final image and incurs a penalty for over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of connection overcoming skepticism emerges organically through action and imagery, culminating in the powerful final symbol of the co-created light painting. The story avoids a simplistic moral. However, Mia's line "it's about hidden pathways in the soul" is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the otherwise excellent subtext, functioning as a minor thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of bridging old and new worlds through a "factually mystical" lens is compelling and well-integrated. However, the explicit labeling of concepts like "transitional object" feels overly didactic, and the final sentence borders on a thematic summary ("she... would ensure the unknown was heard"). These moments of telling dilute the resonance that is otherwise powerfully built through the central image of the floating fossil.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of shared wisdom reweaving destiny emerges organically from the central metaphor of the buttons. The final image of "boundless grains" is a resonant answer to the story's central question. Unfortunately, this resonance is severely undercut by an explicit thematic statement: "It spoke of unity, of how prophecies were but echoes of choices..." This moment of telling violates the story's otherwise subtle craft, explaining the moral instead of trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding "unused courage" in quiet acts of repair is central and coherent. However, its delivery is heavy-handed, detracting from its resonance. The final paragraph explicitly states the story's moral ("He had found where unused courage waits...in quiet, daring acts of fixing the broken"), a thematic summary that replaces the power of the final image and incurs a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the central theme is coherent and driven by a strong controlling metaphor (the palimpsest), its execution is undermined by a lack of subtext. The story repeatedly states its own thematic argument in prompt-like language, such as "to distill complexity into essence" and the final summary that Elias "distilled it all to its core." This direct moralizing replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of gentle defiance and accumulated kindness is potent and well-integrated through the central image of the oasis. However, the final paragraphs slip into explicit summary, directly stating the story's moral: "He had his answer: places like this persisted because kindness rooted them..." This thematic echo undermines the power of the final image, replacing earned resonance with a less effective authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding purpose by nurturing fragile, hidden beauty is beautifully integrated into the plot. The final image of the renewed glimmers is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of fading beauty posed by the fallen rose petal. The score is held back by moments of thematic overstatement, such as directly naming her motivation "to reflect light into those dark corners," which verges on summarizing the story's core metaphor instead of letting it emerge solely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of transforming grief into strength is coherent, its delivery is overly explicit. The final two paragraphs function as a thematic summary, directly telling the reader the meaning of events with lines like "brittle awakenings were not weaknesses, but necessary fractures." This moralizing supplants the resonance that the final image could have carried on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection weaving through secrecy and art is elegantly developed through the central metaphor of the spiral and the collective installation. The story builds resonance organically until the final paragraph. A significant flaw is the concluding sentence, which explicitly states the story's moral ("a testament that...wholeness awaits..."), a form of thematic summary that dissipates the earned ambiguity and power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic exploration of manipulation, belief, and the difficult work of maintaining unity is handled with subtlety and depth. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge organically from Elara's struggle. The final image of her lonely vigil offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, embracing complexity over a simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of rebellion against confinement is consistently woven through the narrative, connecting the character's personal history to his quest. Unfortunately, the ending abandons subtlety for overt moralizing. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("a tool for those rebelling against life's narrow paths," "true freedom came not from escaping shadows, but from defying them"), functioning as a "Thematic Echo" that severely undermines the earned resonance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of "unifying opposites" is handled with excessive directness, reading more like an author fulfilling a prompt than an organic idea. The phrase is repeated, and the final paragraph explicitly states the story's moral ("By lancing the divide between opposites... he had... awakened his own heart"). This heavy-handed thematic echo undermines any potential for subtext or resonance, turning the ending into a summary of its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of inherited burdens and historical justice emerge organically from Elara's quest. The story builds resonance through the central objects and her resolve. However, the final line—"honoring Harlan could mend more than history—it might calm the skies' inherited rage"—is a thematic overstatement. This explicit connection feels unearned, bordering on a moral summary that reduces the elegant ambiguity built previously.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from severe thematic echoing, repeatedly using prompt-like language ("pixelated amnesty," "sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’," "luminous disbelief") as direct statements of theme. Instead of emerging from subtext and action, the themes are explicitly articulated, particularly in the final paragraphs. This replaces resonant discovery with a summary, leaving little for the reader to interpret and cheapening the conceptual core.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of cycles is woven throughout the narrative, from the train tracks to the startup's name and fate. However, the story falters in the final paragraph by explicitly stating its theme: "paths circle back to teach resilience...". This thematic echo replaces a resonant, image-driven conclusion with a direct moral, undermining the subtext built so carefully beforehand.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of shared burdens is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or resonance. The decoded phrase, "Burden shared, dawn breaks eternal," and the final paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral. This thematic echoing replaces earned insight with a tidy summary, significantly weakening the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of revealing hidden truths is masterfully woven through the plot, connecting the external quest to the internal journey. Unfortunately, the story succumbs to stating its theme directly in the final paragraph. The line "discovering at last what mirrors don't show—the quiet wars within, the serene battles of the heart" is a clear thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with a summary, incurring a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of unity achieved through shared wounds is potent and well-integrated, emerging organically from the central metaphor of "linking through scars." The story avoids didacticism, and the final image of Elara stepping free offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of a "fractured world." The piece successfully invites reflection on sacrifice and connection without stating a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of sacrifice for the sake of healing is woven deeply into the plot's fabric, with the tarot card serving as a potent symbol. The story’s main weakness here is a tendency toward over-statement. Phrases like "patch holes in the soul" and the Keeper’s meta-commentary "Inlaying meaning everywhere, are we?" explicitly state thematic concepts that are already clear from the action, reducing subtext and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding meaning "after the applause" is masterfully woven through the band's history, the song title, and the quarry setting. It emerges organically from the story's particulars. The score is held back by the final paragraph, which explicitly states the thematic realization, functioning as a "thematic echo" that slightly lessens the resonance of an otherwise subtle and powerful exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transition is coherent and explored through compelling imagery and analogy. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement, explicitly labeling its own mechanics with phrases like "analogous to transition" and "bridged the touching distance." This over-articulation functions as a thematic echo, particularly in the final paragraph, reducing subtext and replacing resonant discovery with a tidy summary of the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme—that unity and wonder are found by embracing contradiction—emerges organically from the central action, rather than being imposed. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering its thesis through the ritual of smelting ("accept the storm within peace, and peace within the storm"). The final image and line provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a powerful and earned thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of connection overcoming isolation emerges organically from the initial setup but is undermined by overt statements in the latter half. Phrases like "dissolving the walls between hearts" and the final declarative sentence, "And so, in the depths, unity was crowned," function as thematic summaries. This explicit moralizing replaces the potential for resonant subtext with a tidy, pre-packaged message.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of forgiveness as adaptation rather than erasure is potent and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally explains its own subtext, particularly in the analysis of the graffiti ("It alluded to a deeper truth... a subtle nod to resilience"). This direct proclamation slightly weakens the resonance that the powerful central image, "Rivers don't regret their floods," could have achieved on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of giving voice to the silenced is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, its expression borders on the didactic, with lines like "to give voice to the voiceless through her documentation" functioning as direct thematic statements. This lack of subtext prevents the theme from achieving the resonance of a truly exceptional piece, feeling more stated than earned through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of fate versus free will is capably introduced through compelling images like the violin and coffee stains. The final image of a "hidden garden within the realm's vast expanse" is a potent metaphor. However, by avoiding the promised sacrifice, the story retreats into a simplistic resolution, ultimately offering a sentimental answer rather than a complex or emotionally honest exploration of its central question.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preserving beauty and essence against oblivion emerges organically from the central conflict and character motivation. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the resonant final image of the glowing chip and Elara's quiet, unanswered question to carry the thematic weight. This creates a powerful, lingering sense of both triumph and melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the theme of finding contentment through service is coherent, its delivery is overly explicit. The final paragraph devolves into a direct summary of the story's moral ("She had forgiven, climbed for wisdom... and found contentment..."), a clear "thematic echo" that undermines the resonance of the preceding actions. This replaces earned subtext with a tidy, declarative statement, significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of embracing nuance over rigid certainty is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story frequently explains its own symbolism, as with the "cloak of doubt." The final sentence, "...a beacon not of unwavering light, but of the nuanced glow that comes after doubt's embrace," functions as an explicit moral, which significantly undermines the resonance that the preceding scene had already earned. This is a clear "Thematic Echo" penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of patient, indirect teaching is woven skillfully through the central metaphor of the ripples. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements in the final act. The line "...to teach vanishing to appear, one must withhold until the mind is ready, weaving truth carefully..." functions as a direct summary of the moral, a thematic echo that reduces the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core themes of stillness versus wandering and harmony versus chaos emerge organically from the narrative's central conceit. The final image of the skimmer's smile is potent and resonant. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the concluding sentence, which explicitly summarizes the theme ("stillness could conquer wandering...") rather than allowing the preceding images to carry the full weight of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of authentic creation versus automation is powerfully and consistently explored, culminating in a resonant final image. The story loses a step by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraphs ("he found what automation had stolen... No algorithm could replicate this"), which slightly undermines the power of the otherwise excellent symbolic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of seeking truths hidden behind mundane appearances is woven organically through the narrative, from the map to the key tag itself. The final image of Elias lighting his lamps "with new eyes" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his quest without any moralizing. The concept of "luminous vows" effectively links personal will to perception, culminating in a thematically satisfying conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding hope within despair, and purpose in cycles of cosmic death and rebirth, emerges with power and subtlety. The "backwards prophecy" is a brilliant conceptual vehicle for this exploration. The story’s final line—"The stars will doubt, but they will return"—offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, perfectly re-weighting the meaning of "stellar doubt" from a personal flaw to a cosmic necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of giving form to fear to manage it is potent and emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the piece undermines its own subtext by explicitly labeling its key ideas, such as stating the "core concept that defined his existence: the echo of sacrifice." This authorial intrusion feels like a summary, reducing the power of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of earnest faith overcoming inadequacy emerges organically from the plot, and the closing image of spectral fish is a resonant, non-literal grace note. However, the final sentence—"having righted the scales through naive earnestness and precise understanding"—functions as an unnecessary authorial summary. This direct statement of the moral slightly undermines the preceding symbolic strength.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming personal loss into shared legacy emerges powerfully from the story's central action. However, an early sentence explicitly states Elias’s motivation "to spin stories into shared meaning," which functions as a thematic statement that slightly preempts what the ending dramatizes so effectively. While the final image is resonant and avoids a simple moral, this minor instance of telling what will later be shown holds it back.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of harmonizing the measurable and the mystical emerges organically from the plot. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, most notably in the final paragraphs ("born not from isolation, but from the seamless weave of mind and spirit"). This explicit moralizing, a form of thematic echo, slightly lessens the resonance that the powerful final images have already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preserving trust through inventive leadership is well-integrated and emerges organically from the plot. The parachute buckle serves as a strong motif for innovation born of experience. However, the final sentence ("attentively inventive revisions had turned peril into possibility once more") functions as an overt thematic summary. This moralizing statement slightly undermines the resonance of the final image, moving from earned implication to direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of achieving wholeness by integrating complementary opposites is executed with sophistication. It's not just stated but becomes the literal method for the climax, moving beyond abstract idea into concrete action. The final image of the merged entity serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central problem of inner division, resisting a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of innovation emerging from receptive silence is well-integrated into the plot. However, the story leans too heavily on repeating its own key terms ("orthogonal," "flow," "safeguard"), culminating in a final paragraph that verges on thematic summary ("a testament to orthogonal thinking and receptive wonder"). This direct statement slightly flattens the resonance that the preceding imagery had successfully built.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is handled with impressive subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's central, peculiar conceit. The narrative explores grief and enduring connection without resorting to sentimentality or direct statement. The final image of the eternal symphony offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about loss, beautifully re-weighting the meaning of a "haunting."

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding peace through internal reframing rather than external change emerges powerfully from the central narrative action. The final image of uncertainty as a companion offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic over-statement, particularly the line "What if displacement was not loss but transformation?", which comes perilously close to a Thematic Echo, slightly reducing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of renewal through creative destruction emerges organically from the plot's core mechanic rather than being stated. It culminates in a potent, non-literal final image—the phoenix staff—that provides a resonant answer to the story's central question about destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of renewal is powerfully integrated into the plot's mechanics. However, its resonance is significantly undercut by moments of overt thematic statement, particularly the "Thematic Echo" of "to find the beginning in every ending." This direct explanation weakens the subtext and feels like an unnecessary authorial intrusion in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed, explicit statements rather than emerging from character and action. The final paragraphs contain multiple instances of thematic moralizing, such as "positivity could forge enduring bonds" and the direct explanation of the "permanent transient" tone. This replaces resonant imagery with a concluding lecture, a critical flaw for literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of memory and connection is woven beautifully through the narrative's central conceit, but the final sentence is a critical flaw. The line "...connections weren't lost, merely rewoven..." is an on-the-nose thematic statement that replaces earned resonance with a direct explanation. This "Thematic Echo" significantly undermines the power of the final image by refusing to trust the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of progress's bittersweet cost is developed with nuance and subtlety, emerging organically from the central conflict. The story uses the anchor chain as a powerful, recurring image that shifts in meaning from a simple relic to a symbol of cosmic connection and finally to a metaphor for balanced exploration. The final vow offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension, avoiding any hint of moralizing and leaving a lingering sense of profound ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of connection beyond death emerges organically from the plot, but the final paragraph resorts to overt thematic summary. The line "...proving that tracing hearts could heal more than intended" functions as a stated moral, violating subtext at the crucial moment of closure. This thematic echo significantly weakens the story's resonance by explaining the meaning that the preceding scene had already effectively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of honoring the forgotten emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the quieted facility is resonant. However, the story falters slightly by explicitly stating its thematic conclusion in the final paragraph: "...and in doing so, found a piece of himself." This moment of telling, a form of thematic summary, slightly diminishes the power of the preceding dramatized events, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding strength in failure is coherent but delivered with excessive directness. Lines like "failure is the forge" and the final paragraph's summary of "tender lessons" function as overt moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern preempts subtext and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the resonant final images, stating what should have been left for the reader to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of preserving essence through transformation emerges organically from the story's concrete particulars. The central concept of translating texture into sound is a profound and non-literal exploration of memory and cultural survival. The final image of the canyon singing offers a resonant, unsentimental answer to the story's central problem, avoiding any explicit moralizing and leaving a lasting impression of quiet triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of transforming grief into a new form of existence is potent and integrated well through the story's central metamorphosis. The concept of loss as a "cosmic joke" is a strong, ironic core. However, the final paragraph succumbs to thematic summary ("She had turned sorrow into the cosmos's grand jest"), explicitly stating the story's moral instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of life/art versus mechanism is woven skillfully through recurring images like the heartbeats versus ticks. The final image of the reawakened orchard is resonant. However, the final sentence, "...proving that even in a mechanical world, beauty could be uprooted and set free," is an explicit thematic summary that slightly undermines the earned subtext of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of maintaining connection amidst division is coherent, its delivery is excessively heavy-handed. Core thematic phrases—"where broken promises heal," "linking absences," "foster connections"—are repeated so frequently that they become intrusive authorial statements rather than emergent ideas. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme, undermining the power of the preceding scene and leaving no room for subtext or reader discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding potential in perceived limitations emerges organically from the story’s central images, particularly the silent, perpetually galloping carousel horses. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about silence. The piece avoids a simple moral, though a few phrases, such as "interpret silence not as an end, but as possibility," veer close to direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of tangible, "analog" memory versus the ephemeral emerges organically from the story's central object and action. The synthesis of geometry, poetry, and memory feels profound rather than academic. The final image of the re-folded scarf provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central quest, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of vitalizing memory through art emerges organically from the plot and imagery, culminating in a resonant final beat. However, the story's last sentence—"...proving that even in luminous voids, dreams could be vitalized anew"—is an explicit thematic summary. This moralizing statement undercuts the earned, image-based conclusion by stating the theme directly, which is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of love unlocking potential trapped by fear emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, particularly the "enveloped secrets were not barriers but cocoons" epiphany and the summarizing final sentence, which edges into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of reclaiming one's past with wisdom gained over time emerges organically from the plot. However, the story's final lines commit a significant thematic misstep. The sentence, "the real treasure was not the legends she chased, but the self she recovered in their pursuit," is a direct moral statement that feels like a prompt-driven summary, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at a crucial moment and incurring a thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of earning resilience by confronting one's failures is coherent and well-integrated into the story's concepts and imagery. However, the delivery lacks subtlety, relying on direct thematic statements from Elara that function as authorial moralizing. The line "Your exile reverses when you face what you fled" explicitly states the theme, replacing subtext with a tidy, didactic lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preserving wonder in a mundane world emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final image of rejuvenated adults and children provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The piece is held back slightly by lines that verge on thematic summary, such as "rediscovering the color of wonder they thought lost forever," which slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of peace achieved through confronting buried truths emerges organically from the plot. The story's final image—the "interlaced hush transforming into a grounding calm"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. While effective, the constant repetition of core conceptual phrases ("accumulated silence," "interlaced hush") makes the theme feel slightly over-signaled, preventing it from having the full subtlety of truly elite work.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence and the continuity of empathy across time is elegantly woven through the narrative. The final image of a "portal to forgotten empathies" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the story occasionally verges on stating its theme directly (e.g., the title-like phrase "interpret silence with empathy"), which slightly diminishes the subtextual power of the otherwise masterful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the snow globe and the physics of particles. However, the story leans too heavily on explicit thematic statements, especially near the end. Lines like "the note wasn't just history, but a formula for peace" and the final sentence come dangerously close to summarizing the moral, slightly diminishing the resonance that the powerful imagery had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of articulating unspoken needs is central but delivered with excessive directness, bordering on thematic echo. Lines like "articulate unspoken needs" and the graffiti's explicit plea "Hear me, free me" state the theme rather than letting it emerge from subtext. This lack of subtlety prevents the story from achieving genuine resonance, resolving into a tidy moral rather than a complex emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding joy beneath anguish is coherent and central to the story. However, its execution lacks subtlety and relies on direct, repetitive statements rather than emergent discovery. Phrases like "joy beneath anguish" and "affectionate detachment" are used as explicit labels, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the theme ("a testament to finding warmth in detachment"). This heavy-handed thematic echo undercuts the potential for resonant subtext, stating the story's moral instead of letting the final image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory and loss is explored with originality through the central conceit. The "spooled wholeness" motif provides a powerful conceptual frame. However, the story occasionally lapses into telling its theme directly, particularly in the final paragraph. The line "The wholeness wasn't lost; it was merely rewound in the sky's infinite spool" is a thematic echo that summarizes the revelation rather than allowing the final image to carry the resonance alone, slightly diminishing its power.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of embracing finitude in the face of the infinite emerges organically from the central conflict, avoiding any didacticism. The final image of the "fractally precise yet humbly limited" portrait serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It's a resonant conclusion that reweights the initial motivation without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "sociable isolation"—finding connection through solitary, focused work—is woven skillfully throughout the narrative, emerging organically from character and action. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the final image of the airship sailing onward to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of a lonely discoverer's purpose. The central concept is explored with nuance and lands with quiet power.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of mending time through memory and rhythm is woven effectively through the narrative's imagery, particularly the recurring motifs of the sea and eclipses. The story avoids a simplistic moral, ending on a resonant note of bittersweet fulfillment. Some thematic statements, like repairing "the frayed threads of time itself," border on being too explicit for a truly subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of unity is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or emergent discovery. Key thematic phrases like "reexamine divisions," "orchestrate a collective effort," and "Hope blooms in unity" are explicitly stated in messages, dialogue, and narration. The final paragraph functions as a moral summary, a clear instance of the "thematic echo" anti-pattern, which tells the reader the story's meaning rather than allowing it to resonate through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding meaning through a compassionate act against inevitable oblivion is developed with subtlety and power. The final image of the lullaby reaching a distant child is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme avoids simple morals, embracing a complex, bittersweet emotional truth. The score is capped here because of the repetition of thematic labels like "bruised awe" and "beautifully flawed," which feel slightly over-insisted upon, bordering on authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in an inescapable, "graceless" duty emerges organically from the character's struggle, culminating in a powerful thematic reprise. The phrase "graceless beauty" is re-contextualized in the final paragraph, transforming from a description of a place she resents into a descriptor of her own life's purpose. This reweighting provides a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story's central question without a single word of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of divergence and reconnection is powerfully integrated through recurring images, but the story succumbs to stating its own moral. The final dialogue ("'It's us... divergent paths braiding back, separation translated into connection'") is a textbook Thematic Echo, replacing resonant imagery with an explicit summary that significantly flattens the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of narrative origins emerging from absence is powerfully integrated into the setting, character, and plot. However, the story frequently undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its thematic machinery. Phrases like "a reminder that all tales start from measured voids, incised with light" in the final sentence function as a thematic summary, reducing the resonance that the preceding images had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of confronting and integrating regret is powerfully embodied in the story's unique magical system. The central metaphor of tasting and refining memories is carried through to the end. The final image of the smoothed memories and resilient fortress provides resonance, though it leans toward a slightly too-tidy moral, lacking the lingering ambiguity or complexity that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of connection overcoming division is central but delivered with a heavy hand. Instead of emerging from subtext, it is explicitly stated in phrases like "construct bridges from silos... connections that would link isolated farmers" and "rehabilitating not just structures, but spirits." This direct moralizing, a form of Thematic Echo, undermines the power of the central metaphor and leaves little for the reader to discover.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from a heavy-handed delivery of its themes. Instead of allowing themes of transformation and mental resilience to emerge from events, it repeatedly states them using overt labels like "profound transformation" and "synaptic plasticity." The final paragraph delivers a direct moral ("a testament to the power of modification..."), a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with a concluding thesis statement, violating the principle of earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    A coherent theme about unique perception unlocking hidden knowledge emerges, supported by recurring images of light and refraction. However, the theme is delivered a bit too explicitly, especially in the final line about the "power to refract the world's hidden lights anew." This feels more like a thematic statement summarizing the moral than a resonant, non-literal answer emerging purely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme of healing through empathic creation is compelling, but its execution is undermined by a lack of subtext. Core concepts like "empathy in motion" are explicitly stated rather than allowed to emerge from the action. This direct thematic articulation, particularly in the final paragraphs ("a bridge of sound born from analysis and empathy"), functions as a moral summary that flattens the story's resonance. It tells the reader the meaning instead of trusting the images and events to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and resilience in imperfection emerges organically from the story’s central images, particularly the dented stone and the re-framing of the "eclipsed covenant." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. A minor deduction is applied for the final sentence, which veers close to a direct thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of empathy achieved through listening emerges organically from the story's core conceit and action. However, the final third commits a significant flaw by explicitly stating its thesis: "empathy bloomed not in confrontation, but in tuning to the frequencies of another's silence." This thematic echo replaces resonant subtext with a direct summary, undercutting the power of the preceding scene work and preventing the theme from achieving higher resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of embracing turmoil to find peace is potent but undermined by overt moralizing. The story repeatedly resorts to "Thematic Echo," stating its thesis directly in lines like "serenity thrives not in stillness, but in embracing the flow." This tendency culminates in the final paragraphs, which function as a summary of the moral rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own, significantly reducing subtext and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of resilience emerging from a connection to the past is well-integrated into the plot's central discovery. The imagery of ancient warriors seeding life is resonant. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("...now promised renewal, all thanks to her intrepid journey"), explicitly stating the story's meaning rather than allowing the final image to convey it, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of foresight and "singular convergence" is coherent but handled with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly states its core concepts directly, such as "that was the core concept haunting her notes" and the final paragraph's summary of what she will report. This thematic telling undermines subtext, replacing emergent resonance with explicit moralizing, which significantly weakens its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of wonder's essential nature emerges, but it is stated too directly rather than being left to resonate through subtext. The motivation is articulated like a thesis statement ("to certify wonder as essential"), and the final line acts as a concluding moral ("wonder, unfettered, was the chisel that shaped existence itself"). This thematic moralizing in the final paragraph undermines the earned resonance of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of transforming failure into wisdom is well-integrated and resolves into a resonant final image. The move from isolation ("relic keeper") to community ("forge alliances") is a strong thematic arc. A minor deduction is warranted for the overly explicit thematic statement "to harvest insights from failure," which is repeated and feels closer to a prompt than emergent theme.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic exploration of order versus chaos is woven seamlessly into the plot, character, and imagery without resorting to overt statements. The final realization ("the mathematics of emotion lay in its refusal to be fully solved") lands as an earned epiphany rather than a didactic moral. The final image of Elias gathering the "disorienting artifacts" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial quest, showing his transformation from solver to sharer.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transforming memory into myth is coherent and central to the plot. However, its execution lacks subtlety. The narrative frequently resorts to explicit thematic statements that feel like authorial explanation, such as "Thorne's teachings mythologized through her actions." This direct labeling, particularly at the moment of closure, functions as a "Thematic Echo" that preempts resonance rather than allowing it to emerge from the image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding truth through unconventional means and emotions imprinting on objects emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of Marcus leaving "changed" is a resonant, non-literal answer to his desperation. However, the score is capped by a couple of on-the-nose thematic statements, particularly "emotions don't vanish; they seep into what surrounds us," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of sacrifice as the ultimate expression of love emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor of weaving. The narrative avoids simplistic moralizing, and the final image of the orchard absorbing Elara's essence offers a powerful, non-literal resolution. The repeated phrase "latent sacrifice" slightly over-articulates the theme, but the final resonant image overcomes this minor heavy-handedness.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding resilience in brokenness emerges organically from the central plot. The final image of the revived orchards provides a resonant answer to the story's central problem. However, the piece leans heavily on repeating its thematic keywords ("bartered awakenings," "understanding and confusion," "resilience"), which occasionally feels like authorial signposting rather than allowing the theme to arise purely from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of hidden truths and their burdens emerges organically from the plot. The main weakness is an overreliance on direct thematic statements, particularly the repeated phrase "the weight of a withheld truth." This thematic echo functions like a label, telling the reader the story's central idea rather than allowing it to resonate solely through action and image, which lessens its final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of creating tangible connection and safety to combat intangible loss is woven beautifully through the central motifs of the letter chain and the sea glass. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly capped because phrases like "to bottle the feeling of safety" and "a glow that pierced the heart with longing" occasionally state the theme with a directness that slightly undermines the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    A potent theme—using historical wisdom to navigate informational chaos—emerges clearly from the central conceit. The final image of shadows birthing "luminous silhouettes" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the theme is occasionally stated too directly ("birthing a era where wisdom prevailed over fleeting data bursts"), verging on authorial moralizing that undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of gentle illumination is beautifully developed through the interlocking motifs of the dye master, the iridescent wing, and the sun trails. The final image of Elias descending with a transformed purpose is resonant. However, the last two paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("stories magnetized to those who illuminated gently..."), which undercuts the subtext and shifts from showing to telling, preventing the theme from emerging with full power from the narrative itself.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding profound resilience and healing in the mundane is beautifully woven through the narrative's imagery. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the line, "Elias stepped back... and understood that trees witnessed resilience." This moment of direct thematic statement acts as an explicit summary, preventing the theme from emerging purely through the reader's inference. It's a minor but noticeable flaw in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of connection and renewal through shared memory is woven throughout the narrative and culminates in a resonant final image. The core concept of "woven dawns" is well-integrated into the plot's mechanics. The main weakness is a tendency towards overt thematic statements, such as "Elara knew she possessed the attribute that knits communities together," which functions as a label that slightly undermines the organic emergence of the theme from action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the core theme of "nestled paradoxes" is potent, its execution is marred by direct authorial statements. The story commits the anti-pattern of a "Thematic Echo," particularly in the final third ("the mistake wasn't a dead end but a nested path..."). This explicit moralizing replaces the resonance that should emerge from the final image, undermining the subtext and treating the reader as if they cannot draw their own conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding sacredness in the mundane is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext through over-articulation. The final paragraph especially functions as a thematic summary ("knowing sacredness bloomed from ordinary acts"), which explicitly states the moral instead of letting the final image resonate on its own, triggering the thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of preserving meaning against entropy is woven deeply into the story's concept and imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of preserved light. However, the theme is occasionally over-articulated, particularly in the line "Driven by a motivation to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion," which borders on stating the story's thesis directly rather than letting it emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of trust, betrayal, and the nature of justice is powerfully integrated, particularly through the unique concept of capturing a sound. The story earns its resonance through action. However, the final line, "her father's daughter at last avenged," verges on a thematic statement, slightly over-explaining the emotional closure that the preceding scene had already so effectively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of embracing chaos and nostalgia in a technologically tamed world emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final revelation provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the weather-carrier’s explanation, "It's nostalgia for chaos," verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing subtext in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of confronting self-doubt to unlock potential is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the locked chest. The final image provides a resonant, non-moralizing conclusion. However, the narrative sometimes states its theme too directly ("The act... had only corked his soul, leaving him hollow"), which verges on thematic summary and slightly diminishes the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of candor is elegantly woven through the story's unique mechanics and imagery. However, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary ("candor in small moments wasn't lost but waiting..."). This direct moralizing replaces the resonant power of the final image with an explanation, a significant flaw that reduces the story's lingering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of preserving truth and wonder through non-verbal art emerges organically from the story’s events and imagery. The final scene provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem without resorting to moralizing. The piece is held back slightly by the use of somewhat generic conceptual labels like "color of wonder" and "symphonies of truth," which feel stated rather than purely evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the theme of integrating trauma to achieve wholeness is potent, the story occasionally resorts to direct thematic statements. Phrases like "wholeness emerging from the shards" and "mirroring her own pieced-together existence" function as authorial labels on the subtext. The final image is resonant, but the thematic articulation leading up to it could trust the reader more.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of healing through listening is central and well-integrated into the plot's actions. However, the story undermines its own subtlety by explicitly stating its moral in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "...proving her belief: listening heals..." replace resonant imagery with didactic summary, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is stated explicitly and repeatedly, functioning more as a thesis statement than an emergent property of the narrative. The story ends by summarizing its own moral: "her vulnerabilities encrypted forever as strength." This heavy-handed thematic echo in the final paragraph replaces earned resonance with a direct explanation, violating the principle of showing over telling at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story explores its themes of memory, loss, and willful forgetting with nuance, embedding them within the narrative's central magical conceit rather than stating them. The final image of Elias clutching the suddenly-vivid wildflowers offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s driving question, beautifully re-weighting the object from a relic of the past to a key for the future. This powerful, earned resonance avoids any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of imposing quiet will upon chaotic fate emerges organically from the central action of mapping silence. The story's final image of the star-reflected brook offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the core problem. However, the final sentence—"he had mapped it into oblivion with a tranquil blaze of will"—verges on thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the otherwise subtle and well-earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of belief, narrative, and truth is woven skillfully throughout the story, primarily through the central concept of "agreed upon lies." The final realization that "the language of old buildings was not just words, but the stories we agree to believe" serves as a resonant Conceptual Repricing. While this line borders on being an explicit thematic statement, it functions as an earned epiphany that reweights the entire story, preventing a heavier penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming isolation into strength is powerfully developed through the parallel between Elara and the guardian spirit. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its theme too directly. The final paragraph's articulation ("true independence was not solitude's end, but its masterful translation") functions as a thematic echo that summarizes the earned insight, slightly reducing the resonance that the final image had already achieved on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of forgiveness and completing a legacy emerges organically from the plot, with the central action of "unlinking" serving as a potent metaphor. The final image of Elara "unlinked from her past" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her core struggle. The story’s only minor thematic weakness is its tendency to state its intentions, which slightly diminishes the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of resonance, memory, and completeness is woven beautifully through the narrative and imagery, particularly the fractured seashell. Unfortunately, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic summary ("Some echoed to teach, others to warn..."). This direct moralizing undermines the preceding subtlety and prevents the piece from achieving true thematic excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of salvaging truth while protecting the innocent emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a resonant final image. The story resists a simple moral, embracing the complexity of its central problem. A minor deduction is warranted for a moment of slight over-explicitness, as when the text declares "It revealed the pure truth," which momentarily replaces subtext with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of appreciating "hidden effort" is woven through the story with impressive coherence, using the central motifs of nets, tea, and stonework. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's inquiry. However, the theme occasionally surfaces too explicitly in the prose, as in "he vowed to share this appreciation, teaching the villagers to see the unseen weaves," which verges on summarizing the moral rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of "truth versus comfortable lies" is explored with nuance and depth, moving beyond a simple binary. The narrative begins with the protagonist's firm stance and ends by forcing him (and the reader) to confront the immense cost of that conviction. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a powerful thematic ambiguity without resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of renewal born from decay is potent, but its delivery borders on the overt. Phrases like "ancient umbras birthing light's first kiss" function as direct thematic statements rather than emerging implicitly from the action. The final line, "whimsy in the grit, dawn from the void," is a powerful image but also serves as a near-explicit summary of the story's thesis, which slightly undermines the subtextual resonance by making it too legible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of intergenerational connection and memory is coherent but executed with a heavy hand. Key thematic ideas are delivered via direct authorial statement ("to become the translator between generations," "redemption gleaned from the whispers of time") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This over-explanation, especially in the final paragraphs, functions as a stated moral that preempts reader discovery and flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story has a coherent thematic core concerning absolution, guilt, and protection. The final beat, where the protagonist's own guilt surfaces, provides a resonant turn. However, the theme is delivered with a heavy hand. Concepts like "sonic absolution" and "purging the flesh of guilt" are explicitly stated multiple times, functioning as thematic labels that undermine subtext. This repetition of the story's thesis prevents the theme from emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of patient, strategic revolution is central and coherent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The dialogue serves as a direct mouthpiece for the theme, as seen in the line, "We must sculpt patience from it, let it harden into the weapon of a patient revolution." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with overt statement, undermining the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of breaking free from inherited trauma is potent, but its delivery is marred by overt explanation. The story commits the anti-pattern of Thematic Echo, explicitly defining its core concept: "Entangled memories...were quantum-like links where traumas from the past reverberated." This demystifies the central metaphor and preempts reader discovery, reducing the resonance that should emerge from subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of redemption is present but delivered with excessive force, leaving no room for subtext or resonance. The narrative explicitly states its core concepts, such as "the value of seeking perspectives beyond one's own bias" and "turn an apology into action... proving we deserve forgiveness." This thematic moralizing, a critical anti-pattern, replaces earned insight and makes the story feel didactic rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of creation against stagnation emerges organically from the story's core conceits, particularly the "yearning algorithm." While a few lines verge on stating the theme too directly ("hungering for purpose"), the final resonant image of the bell's ripple "evolving everything" provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the central question. The story successfully avoids a simple moral, leaving a lingering sense of profound and potentially dangerous discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story explores its themes of memory, deletion, and absence with subtlety and depth, using recurring images like the songs and the patch to build resonance. The final image—Elara clutching a physical copy of the patch while the digital truth vanishes—provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions without any moralizing. The concept of "sensed absence" is woven seamlessly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The core theme is potent, but its execution is severely hampered by overstatement. The phrase "to map empathy onto action" is repeated like a thesis statement, violating the principle of emergence and subtext. This "Thematic Echo" flaw is significant, preventing an otherwise resonant story from achieving subtlety; it tells the reader the theme directly instead of trusting the images and actions to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding solace in acceptance rather than control is beautifully woven through the story's imagery, especially the evolving meaning of the parasol tip. However, the piece is significantly weakened by a moment of thematic overstatement at its climax. The line "Patience folded then, not in despair, but in release—a crease where waiting gave way to acceptance" functions as a direct authorial explanation, a "thematic echo" that slightly undermines the powerful ambiguity of the surrounding images.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding connection through shared imperfection is central but is handled with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly states its own themes, culminating in Mira's final line: "Perhaps mismatches are destiny's way of teaching us to connect." This functions as a Thematic Echo, a moral summary that undermines the resonance that should have been carried by the story's images alone, constituting a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of wisdom being anchored in substance rather than ephemeral words is coherent and integrated into the climax. However, it's weakened by overt statements that verge on thematic moralizing, such as Elar's dialogue and the narrator's direct confirmation, "The echoes shall endure." This undermines subtext and replaces earned resonance with direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transmuting pain into beauty is powerful but is delivered too explicitly, undermining subtext. The story suffers from "Thematic Echo," where characters overtly state the story's meaning, such as Lila's line, "That's like the vines... climbing together, stronger." This moralizing, particularly Elara's direct explanation of the puzzle's purpose, replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, significantly weakening its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of growth versus stasis is elegantly woven through resonant imagery like branching motifs and gardeners. The final image provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece briefly undermines its subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement: "...decoding the pattern of growth that proved knowledge was not a closed book but a living organism..." This moment of telling slightly diminishes the otherwise masterful showing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The themes of memory, time, and the struggle against oblivion are masterfully integrated through recurring imagery like the fog, driftwood, and videotapes. The story avoids stating its themes, instead allowing them to emerge from Elias's specific, tangible quest. The final image—Elias listening as the chalk crumbles—is a perfect, resonant answer to the central conflict without resorting to a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of capturing the ephemeral is beautifully woven through the story’s core images. The final photograph is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its themes directly, particularly in the final paragraph with the line "his sage wisdom preserving beauty amid the ache," which functions as an unnecessary moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding peace by integrating painful memories is potent, but its delivery is overly explicit. Core concepts like "hope had a scent" and "hymning the mundane" are stated directly, functioning as authorial signposts rather than emerging organically from the action. This thematic echoing in the narration prevents the story from achieving deeper subtextual resonance, settling for articulated sentiment over earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully develops its theme of mending fractures through the central metaphor of "closing loops." The final revelation—that shadows are guardians mending the world from a hidden realm—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without resorting to moralizing. The shift to a personal "loop" at the end effectively ties the cosmic theme to the protagonist's inner state, creating a strong thematic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story's themes of forgiveness and transforming the past are coherent but handled too explicitly. Phrases like "to turn mistakes into constellations" and "innovating old pains into new purpose" function as direct authorial statements, a form of thematic echo. The final paragraph summarizes the story's moral rather than allowing a resonant image to convey it, which sacrifices subtext for overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of redemptive creation through gentle, patient work emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor. The transformation of the humble sea glass into a "pearl of stillness" provides a non-literal, resonant answer to Elara's need for atonement. The final image of the shared light beautifully encapsulates the theme without a hint of moralizing, leaving a lasting impression of quiet triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of grafting new meaning onto old wounds is woven through potent imagery like the reclaimed technology and the preserved bee. The final action with the pendant provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is held back by moments of thematic overstatement, such as the final sentence explicitly labeling the "sweet graft of shared meaning," which slightly undermines the power of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of creative struggle and renewal is skillfully woven into the narrative's central metaphor without resorting to overt statements. The resolution avoids a simple moral, instead offering a resonant final image—the feral mists fading into dawn—that suggests a complex synthesis rather than a simple victory. The story's events consistently serve this thematic inquiry, culminating in a satisfying and non-literal conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of restoring harmony by honoring tradition is clear but delivered with little subtlety. The story explicitly states the problem ("the old ways...had been forgotten") and presents a direct, uncomplicated solution. The final image provides resonant closure but ultimately just confirms the initial premise rather than exploring its complexities, ambiguities, or costs, resulting in a piece that feels more like a fable with a stated moral than a nuanced thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is the story's quiet powerhouse, emerging organically from the central conceit of transmuting waste and sorrow into a functional map. The narrative avoids any didacticism, instead allowing the final image of the pulsing, living map to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of navigating grief. The subtext of finding hope in desolation is woven seamlessly into every element.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of preserving wonder through rational means is powerfully conceived and integrated into the story's core conceit. The metaphor of "harvesting echoes" is resonant and sustained. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its theme too directly, such as when articulating the motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason." This verges on a "Thematic Echo," slightly reducing the sense of emergent meaning in favor of explicit declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming burdens into the very instruments of liberation is handled with subtlety and power. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from the weaver’s actions. The final image of the collected weights becoming her "liberated trove" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of her confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding meaning in impermanence is skillfully woven through the central metaphor of carving. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a line like "To contain grief, she realized, was to shape it, not suppress it" verges on an overly direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext by articulating the story's thesis too plainly. This moment of telling, rather than showing, is the primary reason this category doesn't score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of eroded ambition transforming into potential for renewal is developed with resonant imagery, particularly the recurring motif of erosion and silt. The final image of being "whole in her broken sky" offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the central conflict without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of renewal is potent and well-integrated into the plot, particularly through the use of the sextant as a symbol of fractured dreams repurposed for a new future. However, the story suffers from "Thematic Echo," repeatedly stating its core ideas in prompt-like language (e.g., "puzzled out new equations," "view ruins not as endings, but as puzzles"). This overt moralizing in the final paragraphs weakens the resonance, replacing earned insight with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reconciling past dreams with present reality emerges organically from the narrative. The final image of the clock scribe ready to inscribe a melody offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his conflict. The story avoids simple moralizing, though the thematic resonance is slightly dulled by the repetitive use of key phrases, which can feel like authorial signposting rather than purely emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme is clear and consistently developed, exploring the nature of truth, deception, and belief. However, the story frequently articulates its own themes through repeated key phrases ("architecture of lies," "hindsight clarity," "serene upheaval"). This borders on thematic echo, slightly reducing the subtext's power by stating what the resonant imagery already implies, particularly in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic concerns of patience, preservation, and the hidden language of the world emerge organically from the story's particulars. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead allowing the final image of the single, secret-woven seed to resonate with the opening ideas. The theme is deeply integrated into character, action, and setting, resulting in a thoughtful and coherent piece that lingers beyond its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of healing through re-contextualizing loss is powerful and elegantly integrated into the premise. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line "he glimpsed the core of explained absences: not voids to be mourned, but spaces deliberately carved for growth" is a direct summary that feels like an authorial intrusion, slightly weakening an otherwise resonant and complex thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story's core theme—the necessity of embracing flawed beauty in a fallen world—is potent and resolved through a superb final image. However, the execution is hampered by a lack of subtext. Thematic keywords like "flawed genesis" and "bitterly sweet" are repeated so frequently that they function as labels, culminating in a final paragraph that comes too close to stating its thesis directly, slightly undermining the power of its own imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story's theme is powerful but is delivered with a heavy hand that erodes its resonance. The core idea ("scars can sing") is stated explicitly in the motivation and reiterated in the final paragraph, leaving no room for subtext or interpretation. This "thematic echo" functions as a moral summary, undermining the power of the central symbolic action by explaining it to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of science/logic demystifying magic is coherent and integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overt thematic statement in the final paragraph: "proving magic was just reality misunderstood." This summary replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, a significant flaw that prevents the theme from achieving depth. The final image is powerful, but this preceding sentence significantly weakens its impact by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from character, action, and image without a single didactic statement. The central question of how to enact change without destruction is answered through the resonant final image of petals changing their pattern. This offers a powerful, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire piece, demonstrating thematic integration at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme is developed with superb subtlety and depth, emerging organically from the interplay of core images: the stone, the ribbon, and the butterflies. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question in the final image of a "woven, poetic storm." The late introduction of the poetry-trading custom provides a perfect, concrete anchor for the abstract theme.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of atonement is clear but its delivery is severely hampered by overt thematic statements. The story repeatedly uses the prompt's exact phrasing ("restore shared balance," "incremental absolution"), which functions as authorial moralizing rather than allowing the theme to emerge from particulars. This direct explanation flattens the subtext and preempts reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of resolving forgotten intentions and honoring memory emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final image of placing the case on the grave is a powerful, non-literal conclusion. However, the final sentence ("knowing he'd untangled not just threads, but the tender shape of forgotten intentions") veers into thematic summary, slightly diluting the resonance of the preceding action by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of seeding innovation within constraint is woven deeply into the story's fabric through character, setting, and action. The final image of the poised quill serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the central thematic question. However, the theme is occasionally stated too directly (e.g., "sustaining transformation"), which verges on authorial summary and slightly lessens the emergent power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of narrative resilience is beautifully realized without didacticism. The final image of dust motes projecting "holographic vignettes" serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the central problem, offering a resonant and earned conclusion that is only capped by prose flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of impermanence and the beauty of fleeting things is powerfully woven through the narrative. However, the final paragraph contains an explicit thematic statement: "nothing lasts, but in its fleetingness lies wonder." This "thematic echo" articulates the story's moral directly, undermining the subtext and resonance built by the preceding images and actions, a significant flaw for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of objective truth versus subjective narrative emerges organically from the character's struggle, avoiding any didacticism. The chronometer cog serves as a potent, polysemous symbol at the heart of the thematic question. The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that resists a tidy moral, perfectly fulfilling its philosophical ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of achieving harmony through subtraction is fresh, insightful, and well-integrated into the plot. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from Elara's actions. However, the repetition of key thematic phrases and a final sentence that borders on a direct statement ("the arts would not vanish—not while voices could still harmonize") slightly reduces the subtextual resonance, pulling back from a truly exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of gentle rebellion and the power of memory is potent, but its delivery is too explicit. Phrases like "this was his gentle rebellion" and the final paragraph summarizing the outcome ("fostering a subtle uprising") state the theme directly rather than letting it emerge from the action. This thematic echoing, especially at the end, undermines the subtext and replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of preserving wonder in routine is a promising concept, but its execution is overly explicit. The story repeatedly states the theme in narration ("Thorne's motivation...", "to weave wonder back..."), culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a moral summary. This heavy-handedness, a classic "Thematic Echo," undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story develops a coherent theme about how memory and emotion imbue the mundane with life. Unfortunately, the final act falters with a moment of overt thematic summary. The line, "houses felt alive because they absorbed the creeping normalities of lives lived within," explicitly states the story's conclusion, replacing earned resonance with a direct explanation and significantly weakening the ending's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of nuance versus certainty is central and coherently developed, but its execution lacks subtlety. Liriel's dialogue often functions as direct thematic statement, bordering on a moral ("See how certainty's structure weakens without flexibility? Thread nuance in, and strength returns."). This over-articulation, a form of Thematic Echo, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the action, instead presenting it as a lesson being taught.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story weaves its themes of order vs. chaos, imperfection, and the nature of freedom with considerable elegance, culminating in a resonant final image. The core concept of perpetual motion serves as a perfect vehicle for these ideas. The score is slightly limited by a moment of overt explanation ("The chipped die, he realized, symbolized...") which momentarily replaces subtext with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of enduring kindness is potent and emerges organically from the core imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The final sentence, "...methodically hopeful that strangers...would remember and pass on the quiet flame of kindness," functions as a concluding moral, a significant flaw that replaces earned resonance with direct summary. This "thematic echo" pattern dilutes the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic integration is the story's greatest strength. The central theme—that cultural identity is a tool for survival—is not merely stated but demonstrated through the plot's core mechanic (baking initialed bread). The final image, viewed through the lens, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about preservation, achieving a powerful synthesis of action and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of defying fate at a terrible cost emerges organically from the story's mechanics, particularly the hunger stone's dual symbolism. The story resists a simple resolution, ending on a powerful note of ambiguity that serves as a non-literal answer to the central conflict. The final image powerfully reweights the entire narrative without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of vulnerability as a weapon against fear is executed with compelling clarity. It emerges organically from the central mechanic of "unbosoming" secrets, which is cleverly framed by the paradoxical notes. The story avoids moralizing, and the final line provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful emotional aftereffect that reweights the meaning of "resuscitation."

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of transforming chaos into harmony emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The concept of "sketched resonance" provides a powerful mechanical metaphor for this theme. The final sentence, "He had turned peril into performance," verges on being an explicit statement, but it functions as a concluding flourish that crystallizes the earned theme rather than a clumsy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of pursuing forbidden knowledge at any cost emerges organically from the plot and world. The central image of cracking the patterned shell is a powerful, integrated metaphor for the story's core question. The final scene provides a resonant, non-literal answer, though a single instance of telling over showing ("a symbol of her irreversible choice") slightly tempers an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "noble lies" is central and intelligently explored through parallels. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, such as describing the planned book as "not accusatory but revelatory." This slightly undermines subtext by explicitly stating what the preceding action already implied, qualifying as a minor thematic echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of preserving memory is potentially resonant, its execution is far too explicit for a story of this caliber. The narrative repeatedly names its own core concepts—"interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams"—effectively providing meta-commentary instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action. The final paragraph delivers a summary of the theme ("he had become what he sought"), a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story explores potentially resonant themes of truth versus narrative, but their delivery is severely undercut by thematic echoing. Explicitly naming the "core concept of reclaimed stillness" and repeatedly using terms like "dappled resolve" reads as direct authorial signposting, replacing emergent theme with declared labels and weakening the story's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of processing grief through craft is beautifully realized through the central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer that avoids a tidy moral. However, the score is lowered by the on-the-nose thematic echo where Elias murmurs his exact motivation, a moment of telling that slightly undermines the powerful showing elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding purpose in the ruins of potential is powerfully developed without resorting to overt statement. It emerges organically from the central conceit of "unused potential" and Amir's specific actions. The story's final line—"to awaken what the world had buried"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, transforming grief into a generative, albeit sorrowful, mission.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "missing pieces" finding "belonging" is well-integrated, embodied physically by the matrix chip and emotionally by the characters' backstories. The final image offers a resonant answer to the story's central question. The primary weakness is a tendency towards overstatement in the final paragraphs, where the decoded signal "spoke of belonging, pulling her fragmented memories into wholeness," which borders on thematic summary rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story explores complex themes of memory, truth, and deception with nuance, culminating in a resonant, non-moralizing ending. The final image of whispering the truth to the wind is powerful. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line "The sieved hush was his core concept" is a critical flaw, a piece of authorial scaffolding that breaks the narrative illusion and tells the reader the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transforming failure into wisdom is central and organically woven into the plot through character action and symbolism, particularly the drawer pull. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements. The final paragraph, in particular, lapses into summary ("recycled now into the wisdom that would guide future negotiations"), stating the moral that the preceding scene had already powerfully demonstrated. This thematic echo in the final beat slightly dulls the resonance of an otherwise strong and complex exploration of redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story's central theme is embodied in the brilliant central metaphor of celestial versus terrestrial navigation. However, this strength is significantly undermined by repeated instances of "Thematic Echo," where the theme is stated directly in phrases like "to align heart and action" or "The backlash of regrets didn't drown him; instead, it propelled him." This authorial explanation lessens the emergent power of the narrative, telling the reader what to feel instead of trusting the resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of self-redemption is powerfully integrated, culminating in the resonant image of the dissolving signature. However, the story falters slightly in the last two paragraphs by explicitly stating the theme. Phrases like "symbolizing release" and "born from this journey" dilute the subtext by explaining the metaphor instead of trusting the image to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of embracing transformation is coherent but lacks subtlety. The fortune cookie's message, "Embrace the change that calls, for in transformation lies the eternal embrace," functions as an explicit thematic statement delivered upfront. The rest of the story serves as a direct illustration of this maxim, which sacrifices resonant subtext for overt moralizing and feels prescriptive.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of mending past neglect through accepting brokenness is powerfully integrated, particularly through the central motif of the cracked saucer. The final image of tracing her daughter's hand provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. The piece only slightly falters by using near-thematic labels like "cloudbound repentance," which come close to stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of healing through integration rather than suppression emerges organically from the core actions and metaphors. The final image of the portal as a "compassionate dawn" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about achieving peace. It powerfully avoids a simplistic moral, instead offering a complex and emotionally honest conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of transformation is present but handled with a heavy hand. The story culminates in an explicit thematic statement that functions as a moral, a critical flaw ("Elias...finally understood: transformation wasn't abrupt thunder, but a vibrant hush..."). This direct explanation preempts resonance, telling the reader the story's meaning instead of allowing it to emerge from the preceding images and actions. The subtext is almost entirely surfaced by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of quiet, ingenious rebellion is well-developed through concrete images and actions. The final paragraph provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story leans heavily on repeating its core concepts ("cradle of sparks," "silent revolution"), which borders on thematic echo. Phrases like "cradling sparks of equality for all" feel overly declarative, slightly undermining the otherwise effective subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story delivers a powerful thematic resolution, shifting from a premise of "restoration" to one of "understanding and harmony." The final image of Elara standing still is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It falls just short of excellence because the final two sentences lean into direct thematic summary ("leaving her rooted yet free," "no longer fleeing futures").

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming trauma into transcendent art is woven effectively through the central metaphors of storms and scars. However, the story undermines its own subtext with the mentor's explicit message: "Understand the scars, poet, and your voice will pierce the veil." This thematic echo states the story's thesis directly, reducing the resonance that should emerge purely from image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    A coherent theme about transforming abstract questions into tangible journeys emerges from the story's events. However, the theme's power is diluted by being stated too explicitly, particularly in dialogue ("To fence this is to trade riddles for roads") and the final summary sentence. This direct articulation prevents the theme from resonating with more subtle, earned subtext, reading more like a thesis statement than an emergent property of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of forging beauty and life from decay is potent and well-integrated into the story's core imagery. The central metaphor of planting seeds in a ruined library is resonant and memorable. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its theme directly, such as "to forge beauty from anarchy." This thematic echoing, especially in the final paragraphs, lessens the power of the ending image by replacing earned resonance with explicit summary.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of creating refuge against irreversible loss emerges organically from the story's central conceit and objects. The final image—the triumphant melody and the ticking clock—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's grief without resorting to simplistic moralizing. The shift in meaning of key motifs like the clock and compasses from symbols of stasis to symbols of earned peace is exceptionally well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully explores its theme—the necessary marriage of empirical inquiry and faith—without resorting to didacticism. The theme emerges organically from Elara's internal struggle and the nature of her world. The final image of the rapidly growing sprout, a phenomenon that is both measurable and miraculous, offers a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
