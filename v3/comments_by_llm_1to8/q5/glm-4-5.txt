  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the decay/renewal motif but suffers from explicit moralizing, especially in the final paragraph ("to witness and honor the small, humble miracles"). The butterfly wing patterns mirroring galaxies offers resonance, but the piece tells its meaning rather than letting it emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of transformation through art resonates but relies heavily on explicit statements ("art could change the world," "the artist must become the art"). The frost patterns as revelation method offers conceptual interest but the thematic connection between glass artistry and truth-seeking feels mechanically imposed rather than emerging from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of resilience and adaptation emerges through Elena's journey from "capsize survivor" to composer, but remains surface-level. The story explicitly states its themes ("resilience of life, persistence of beauty") rather than letting them emerge through dramatized struggle. The final image of "visible sound and emotional heat maps" offers potential resonance but lacks the weight of earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elias's work giving rest to the dead and his discovery of the library as sanctuary for lost souls. The broken lens as beacon beautifully reweights the concept of preservation. "Giving rest a permanent address" resonates without moralizing, though one line edges toward explicit theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between anonymous individual charity and declared collective resistance, with the bell bridging personal and communal identity. The final declaration reweights earlier midnight runs as rehearsal for open defiance. Intergenerational support reads as lived practice rather than abstract concept, though Elias's direct thematic statement in the climax ("sanctions seek to isolate us") edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of love's transformation across lifetimes emerges through concrete imagery—the camera obscura's projections, Kwan Yin's tear dissolving into skin. The concept avoids easy resolution, though the epilogue's explicit teaching ("where unused love is stored") somewhat undermines the subtlety achieved at the natural closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of time as "complex tapestry woven from infinite possibilities" emerges through the garden's architecture and Elara's experiences, though the story explicitly states this realization rather than letting it arise from particulars. The final image of merger offers resonance, but phrases like "texture of time" and "woven nature" remain abstract rather than grounded in specific embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of resilience and renewal emerges through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in teaching others to "plant resilience in dry soil." However, the thematic resolution in the final paragraph shifts to summary mode with children playing in green fields, losing the specificity that earlier scenes maintained. The "chained liberator" paradox offers conceptual interest but isn't explored beyond surface irony.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme emerges elegantly through the parallel between shipwrecks preserving stories and trust reforming after breaking. The concept that "beauty often emerged from destruction" resonates through multiple story elements without explicit moralizing. The final image of trust reforming "stronger for having been broken" offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though it edges toward neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between stealing and preserving light, with the final revelation that "someone, someday, would need to see these illuminated moments" offering resonant answer to the central question. The recurring light imagery accumulates meaning without heavy-handed symbolism, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thawing/transformation theme emerges organically through the parallel melting of ice and emotional frost, with the glass vessels as "safe zones for inquiry" offering a non-literal answer to healing. The cracked bookmark effectively embodies "beauty persisting in injury," though the final "we thaw" edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The vulnerability-as-power theme emerges through Maya's journey from controlled professional to accepting her authentic self. The seashell's whispers and the recurring motif of hidden truth support this adequately. However, the theme sometimes announces itself too directly ("Vulnerability is power" stated as mantra), and the final revelation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the oracle's practice of "summarizing silence" and finding pathways in absence rather than light. The final insight that the map leads "through silence, not against it" reweights the entire premise without moralizing. The gold leaf booklet's transformation from ancient text to glowing guide elegantly embodies this thematic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    The consciousness-through-service theme emerges organically from the janitor's mundane work elevated to mystical significance. However, the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("thoughts didn't originate from a specific place but emerged from the relationship") commits thematic echo, stating rather than embodying the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of transparency versus privacy emerges clearly but relies on explicit statements ("freed by honesty") rather than earned resonance. The cryptic doodles concept offers originality but the resolution—leaving notes that foster understanding—feels pat. The final paragraph's assertion that "true communication needs no words" arrives as thesis rather than discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of unmeasurable connections emerges through the marble metaphor - "mended deceptions" that gain beauty through their flaws. The parallel between Elias's aging body and the garden's "blooming withering" creates resonance. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("connections transcend quantification"), violating the show-don't-tell principle and reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    The sideways-time concept offers conceptual intrigue and the bird's consciousness spanning dimensions provides thematic resonance about perception and reality. However, theme emerges through direct scientific explanation rather than embodied struggle—Aris's discovery lacks the personal cost that would deepen meaning. The final "otherworldly understanding" between species gestures toward connection but arrives without earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of liminal spaces and unfinished art emerges organically through the flooded opera house and ghost's incomplete aria. The water-created notation literalizes how time and nature collaborate in art. The final image of "once-unstruck chords" finding voice resonates without stating a moral, though some phrasing ("暧昧 possibility") feels unnecessarily abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of perception at margins ("allowing the margins of vision to reveal what merits attention") integrates well with Elias's methodology of smudging illustrations. However, the abstract philosophizing about fate versus free will feels disconnected from the concrete action, and the final paragraph's exposition about "auroral sorrow" and meteoric fragments lacks earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of "swallowed truths" and "ghost shift" concepts but resolves into explicit moralizing: "some truths weren't meant to be swallowed but shared." The final paragraphs abandon scene pressure for thematic summary, particularly "truths that refuse to stay buried" which reads as authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between entropy and preservation, with the keeper embodying the paradox of recording change while remaining unchanged. The final image of "the refuge held, the crumbled library sighed above" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's established dichotomy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" in human connection emerges through Maya's patient work with Lila, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final exchange. The eclipse metaphor of darkness making light more beautiful resonates with trauma and healing. The locket symbolism feels slightly forced but the overall thematic integration through music and connection works.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of lost connection between humanity and mythic/dream realms emerges through the tapestry and diary discoveries. The bronze quiet and displaced axis create resonant imagery. However, the ending offers platitudes about potential restoration rather than a complex, earned insight arising from the historian's specific struggle or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "open secrets" hiding in plain sight emerges clearly through the lighthouse metaphor and fortune cookie conceit. However, it develops through repetitive abstract statements ("truths hiding in plain sight," "open secrets they had finally recognized") rather than concrete dramatized moments. The ending offers philosophical assertion rather than resonant scene work that would reweight prior material through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of using technology for spiritual warfare and silence as ultimate weapon. The entity's pride becoming its undoing and the final reflection that "profound truths require not volume but the space created by silence" resonates without preaching. The indigo color symbolism (void/purity) enriches without forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of temporal displacement and the search for one's rightful moment emerges organically through the glass spire's isolation, the nautilus shell's spiral structure, and the mirrored horizon's visual doubling. The final image of finding place "between echoes of yesterday and promises of tomorrow" resonates, though the thematic exploration would benefit from more complexity or counter-pressure rather than smooth fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    The labyrinth metaphor connects to self-discovery but resolves into therapeutic acceptance without complexity. The story explicitly states its thesis ("conquering the labyrinth meant accepting all parts of himself") rather than earning it through particulars. The fractured timelines concept offers thematic potential but settles for self-help clarity over resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transformation through limitation emerges organically as Eleanor converts deafness into a teaching method. The "filament of hush" and vibrations create a coherent metaphorical system. However, the thematic resolution feels too neat—every element aligns without counter-pressure, and the ending veers toward explicit messaging about finding meaning "without volume."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of integrity versus institutional corruption emerges through Elias's choice to use the system's own tools against it, with the pigeon serving as ironic vehicle for both deception and truth. However, the thematic resolution tends toward explicit statement ("nurture integrity in solitude") rather than allowing the image to carry meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between extinct plants and lost memories, avoiding explicit moralizing until late. The final insight about light/shadow and grief/love offers genuine resonance. However, some thematic statements feel over-articulated ("love that transcended absence"), and the connection between lantern-brokering and emotional illumination borders on heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of temporal perception emerges through rope patterns and accumulated observations, avoiding direct moralizing. However, phrases like "impossible choices" and "texture of time" lean toward abstraction, and the final insight about time as landscape, while resonant, lacks the particularity that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the motif of "beauty in the unfinished"—cracked bowl, broken greenhouse, listing shipwrecks all embody this principle. The final realization that silence contains music waiting to be "unbound" resonates without explicit moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution, maintaining complexity in its portrait of post-disaster renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    The paradox of authentic artificiality and "half truths" philosophy provides thematic coherence, though it manifests primarily through exposition rather than dramatized tension. The irony of finding "genuine fulfillment" in counterfeit work resonates conceptually but lacks embodied struggle. Theme emerges through telling rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of recognizing "invisible threads" and "silent contributors" emerges organically through specific actions rather than declaration. The locket's evolution (mentor → archivist → empty space) creates resonant symbolism without forcing. The "cycles of compassion" integrate naturally, though the final paragraphs edge toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    The web imagery threads throughout—from unseen kinship webs to the sigil's spider-web design to the final carved connection—creating resonant thematic coherence. The ending reweights Elara's arbor from solitary achievement to communal hearth without stating the moral explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of sacrifice for cosmic balance emerges through action rather than statement. The infinity symbol motif and the concept of "echoes being born" create resonance. However, the thematic question doesn't fully crystallize - is this about art versus nature, individual sacrifice for collective good, or time's relationship to sound? The ending provides closure but not a fully resonant answer to a central question.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of quantifying the unquantifiable emerges through Elara's work to bridge emotional and physical realms, with the glass eyes serving as a recurring motif. The final realization that emotion's mathematics concerns relationships rather than cold calculation offers thematic resonance, though it arrives somewhat abstractly without being fully earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of invisible service emerges through concrete action and the tape fragment motif. However, the ending doesn't offer a resonant answer that reweights prior material—the protagonist simply continues their pattern without confronting the cost of perpetual hiddenness. The story states rather than dramatizes the value of hidden knowledge preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    The control versus partnership theme emerges organically through concrete events rather than assertion, with the linden leaf and trellis serving as effective vehicles. The final image of Elara studying "with reverence for nature's wisdom" resonantly reweights her initial obsession without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of transforming trauma into testimony emerges organically through the exchange and Lena's evolution from isolated insomniac to community witness. The phrase "thresh meaning from experience" gains depth through repetition and embodiment. The ending line about "exchanges...not of objects, but of stories and understanding" resonates without moralizing, though some thematic statements like "We need artists now more than ever" feel slightly on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the progression from "seeing" to "creating," with the pearl as catalyst for transformation. "Magic wasn't found in seeing what would be, but in helping to create what might yet become" resonates without preaching. The "bright darkness" paradox and "everyday magic" concepts integrate naturally through shadow-light fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of absence/presence emerges clearly through the harbor's history and returnees' experience. The herald's hidden sacrifice offers complexity. However, the resolution into "shared understanding" feels unearned—we're told about transformation without seeing the specific struggles that create it.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete journey from mapping physical territories to mapping "landscapes of human secrets," with the fortress representing unspoken truths made tangible. The serpent ouroboros and the recurring "hour that divides bad habits and new starts" create resonant motifs that charge the transformation. The final image of Ethan seeing "invisible connections" offers a non-literal answer to questions of perception and truth, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.6)
    The connection between whales, stars, and memory creates thematic coherence, but the piece explicitly states its themes ("connection," "spaces between") rather than letting them emerge from dramatized conflict. The final paragraph's direct moralizing about skeptics becoming believers replaces earned resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of immortality as opportunity rather than curse emerges through Alistair's journey, with the amulet fragments serving as concrete vehicle for exploring loss and continuation. The final insight about goodbye being transition rather than ending resonates with the opening setup. However, the revelation arrives through direct statement ("immortality was not a curse but an opportunity") rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of redemption through honest use of deceptive tools emerges organically from the action. The funeral home's transformation metaphor enriches meaning, though the ending's moral resolution feels slightly too neat - "proving that even the child of a con artist could find an honest path" edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preservation versus loss emerges organically through the contrast between the silent town and Elias's continued work. The concept that "invented histories were no less real than those recorded" adds philosophical depth. The final image of Elias working while "the town below remained silent" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The palimpsest metaphor and erasure theme emerge clearly but through direct statement rather than dramatized particulars. "We are all survivors of erasure in different degrees and forms" exemplifies the explicit thematic assertions that replace scene work. The final paragraph's philosophical summary ("identity is not what is written on paper but what is experienced") demonstrates theme through declaration rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between seeking definitive answers and embracing uncertainty, avoiding explicit moralizing until slight stumbles in the final paragraphs. The cello as memory-retrieval device and the compass pointing to truth create resonant motifs. However, lines like "The universal riddle wasn't about finding a single answer" edge toward thesis statement, and the ending's "beautiful uncertainties" feels slightly pat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of cultural preservation through coded resistance emerges organically from the graffiti system, and "The water remembers what land forgets" provides resonant imagery. However, the ending's moral—that bridging sides resolves conflict—feels unearned without depicting actual compromise costs. The foundation stone's symbolic return gestures toward theme but lacks the weight of genuine sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of progress versus preservation emerges through the fireflies' extinction, but remains at surface level without complexity. The story explicitly states its theme multiple times ("what was being sacrificed in the name of progress") rather than letting it emerge through dramatized conflict. The final image of Elena's satisfaction doesn't offer a resonant answer to the central question—it simply accepts the loss without interrogating it.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of repair as metaphor for maintaining human connections across distance. The water-refraction diagnosis creates a resonant image of seeing differently, though this could be pushed further. The ending achieves thematic closure without explicit moralizing but doesn't fully exploit the complexity available in the blindness/sight paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of origins—both physical and metaphysical—emerges through the concrete quest without explicit moralizing, with the inverted river delta pattern creating a resonant non-literal answer. The story earns its wisdom about humanity's need to seek origins through Elmsley's specific journey rather than assertion. Minor deduction for the slightly neat resolution of science/myth dichotomy without exploring darker implications of either worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of sound healing physical decay—balance between "earth and spirit, silence and sound, decay and growth." The final image of Silverwood "humming softly to itself" offers a non-literal answer about restoration requiring patient, precise attention. Subtext operates through the "wild hush" that deepens rather than empties.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between preservation and loss, embodied in the temporal energy capture. The perfume vial's transformation from memory trigger to time vessel works thematically. Deduction for explicit thematic statements like "time itself had learned to stand still" that over-articulate meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    The truth/lies dichotomy emerges clearly through the father-son parallel, and the confessional lattice creates a resonant metaphor for barriers to redemption. However, the theme remains overly explicit, particularly in direct statements like "not to cry wolf, but to whisper the truth." The ending attempts resonance but lacks the concrete particulars that would elevate beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges strongly through the synthesis of debt/love/transformation, with the final bloom embodying both lovers' essences as "mournful in separation yet elated in reunion." The recurring spiral motif (bead→bloom) creates resonance without heavy-handed symbolism. The ending reweights the greenhouse from prison to testimony of transcendent love, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    The ruin-to-reverence theme emerges through imagery but relies heavily on stated concepts ("bridge between worlds," "restoration of something sacred"). The final paragraphs explicitly moralize about Elara's purpose rather than letting the transformation speak through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of rebuilding as remembering, with the sundial serving as physical manifestation of spiritual return. The final line about "the most direct path home is the longest and most winding" resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture (trembling hands, speaking the old tongue) and the trees leaning in, though "We rebuild because we remember" edges toward explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the tension between transparency and self-invention, surface and depth. The surface mail system becomes a perfect objective correlative for slow transformation versus instant connection. The final image of "invention and rediscovery" resonates without moralizing, though some passages approach thesis-statement territory ("identity's fluidity, a resistance").

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between appearance and reality, wisdom disguised as foolishness. The eternal candle's constancy against chaos and Elara's needle connecting cosmic and earthly events create thematic resonance without explicit moralizing. The ending—"listening for unheard stories in the infinite tapestry"—offers a non-literal answer about hidden knowledge and patient resistance, though it edges toward the poetic-abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "unsent letters" and unspoken truths finding expression through mystical means. The story explores fear, forgiveness, and the spaces between what's said and withheld without moralizing. The final image of condensation forming on another window carrying forgiveness resonates thematically, though the resolution tilts toward emotional tidiness rather than embracing full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of translation beyond language—from war to grief, from adult to child understanding—emerges through particulars like the smudged cast notes. The coral fragment carries symbolic weight as a vessel for meaning, though the story occasionally states its themes too directly ("unknotting" appears four times).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of art bridging past and present emerges organically through the fragment's revelation and community transformation. The final insight "Perhaps all ruins are just stories waiting for the right light" resonates without moralizing. However, the thematic development relies on explicit statements like "to connect past and present through beauty" rather than letting the imagery carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of art as "frozen music waiting for animation" emerges through the nickel's revelations and Elena's synesthetic experiences. However, the explicit statement "art was merely frozen music" in the fifth awakening undermines subtlety. The nested awakenings concept provides structure but feels more like a numbered list than organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of preserving human consciousness against mechanization emerges through concrete resistance methods and botanical metaphors. However, Kaelen's explicit articulation of motivation ("to stand guard over his own spark of defiance") and the final paragraph's thematic summary reduce subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation metaphor—pain photosynthesized into beauty—without explicit moralizing. The final image of the galaxy postcard remaining as connection-in-isolation resonates beyond plot, and the blossom armistice concept reweights suffering versus serenity throughout, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("connection exists even in isolation").

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of memory preservation versus inevitable forgetting emerges organically through concrete details like the "museum of extinct feelings" and the restored names "Xylos. Thalia. Maran." The final image of continued preservation "even as the cloud-mist below continued its endless dance" offers a non-literal answer about the value of temporary acts against entropy. The piece avoids moralizing, allowing the melancholy acceptance to resonate through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of abstract concepts ("symphonies of truth," "interconnected promises") but lacks concrete dramatization. The story tells us about reconciliation and trust without showing specific embodied moments. The ending offers no resonant answer because the central question never faces an on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of harmonizing opposing values emerges organically through Elara's engineering solution rather than abstract statement. The "encrypted compassion" of past and present creates resonance, and the final image of "sustainable future" pays off the thematic question. Some moments edge toward explicit thematic statement ("harmony between necessity and preservation"), but the concrete solution grounds the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of reinvention versus authentic self emerges through concrete details: the meteorite as cosmic survivor finding new purpose mirrors Elara's journey. The final image of the pigeon carrying messages "where digital signals failed" offers resonant commentary on connection without stating a moral. The "Flight Paths" signature reweights all prior hiding. Some metaphors ("discarded feathers") feel slightly convenient but don't undermine the thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the maze metaphor: "the journey out is always also the journey in." The final insight about sacred thresholds as "ones we cross to return to love" reweights all prior crossings without moralizing, earned through Elara's concrete journey.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of universal belonging emerges through the connection between cosmic patterns and underwater life, with the creatures forming "The Belonging" constellation. However, the insight arrives through convenient discovery rather than earned struggle, and the final moralizing about "eternal dance of connection" undermines subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transformation versus loss emerges through repetition and imagery, particularly the seeds-as-potential metaphor. However, the thematic resolution feels overly neat: "disappearance often means becoming something more beautiful" lacks complexity. The piece tells its theme explicitly in multiple places rather than letting it emerge from dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of manufactured serendipity versus genuine spontaneity emerges through Leo's calculated methods, but remains unexplored in its implications. The story doesn't interrogate whether Leo's interventions are gifts or manipulations, missing the opportunity to complicate its central question about orchestrated versus authentic magic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of memory-as-resistance emerges clearly through the cosmic verse concept, though it tends toward explicit statement ("memories were poisons rather than treasures"). The final image of living manuscript resonates but the piece tells its thesis directly rather than letting it emerge from dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme about finding beauty in the mundane emerges through the glazier metaphor and light imagery. However, it's overstated through direct assertions like "value wasn't found only in the extraordinary moments" rather than arising from dramatized particulars. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the box-as-survivor metaphor without explicit moralizing. The concept of "bargained innocence" resonates through concrete details. Final image of being "both scarred and whole" offers a non-literal answer to the trauma question. Minor deduction for "universal language" phrasing that edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of hope through "trial balloons" into parallel possibilities remains conceptually stated rather than dramatically earned. The final image of "infinite possibilities" offers no resonant answer to any central question. Abstract philosophizing about navigating currents replaces concrete thematic emergence from action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of memory embedded in architecture emerges organically through concrete discoveries rather than assertion, with the film negative bridging sonic and visual records. The final image of Elara "adding her own voice to the dreams of walls" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The concept of architectural consciousness accumulates through specific details rather than abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of unexplored possibilities emerges through the mirror visions showing alternate lives, with the borrowed heartbeat literalizing connection between self and possibility. The coded lullabies and generational knowledge create resonance, though the "wonderful" response doesn't fully engage with the weight of seeing unlived lives.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of peace as practice versus event emerges through direct statement ("Peace, they had learned, was not an event but a practice") rather than dramatized particulars. The "flawed beauty" motif appears twice but doesn't accumulate meaning or constrain choice. The story's philosophical stance on conflict resolution lacks the specificity and embodied cost that would make it resonate beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of preservation through release—"preserving the echo of extinct birds wasn't about bringing back what was lost, but honoring what had been." The final image of Silas hearing birdsong "in the silence between thunderclaps" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates through the egg as symbol and the fractured landscape mirroring his soul. Slight deduction for occasional directness in thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of defying conformity while preserving essential self emerges through the courtesan paradox and sanctuary metaphor. The "harvest of echoes" creates resonance with past rebels, though this arrives through summary ("hundreds of whispers") rather than specific dramatization. The final image of Elara as "both lock and key" offers a non-literal answer but lacks the concrete cost that would deepen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of ethical storytelling and reversing dominant narratives emerges clearly through the puppet show device and radar dome transformation. However, the story tells us about "half-lit epiphanies" rather than dramatizing earned insight through specific struggle. The ending offers no resonant answer beyond restating Elias's unchanged position, missing the non-literal culmination that would elevate thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Aris's temporary structures and the vanishing migrations—both ephemeral yet meaningful. The moth wing in amber resonates as "a perfect fossil of something once alive and now remembered only through its delicate remains." The final image of laying "their hand against their heart, where the interrupted cadence of the earth's heartbeat pulsed" offers a non-literal answer to questions of witness and memory without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of preservation versus abstract guilt. The final image of Elara preparing to work "until her own name was transcribed" offers a resonant answer about memory and sacrifice. The organ card fragment as key to unlocking lost names avoids heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central question "Why do some paths choose their walkers?" finds a resonant answer in the reciprocal relationship between fate and free will, emerging through Elara's specific journey. The final insight about the dance between choice and calling reweights the entire quest, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of knowledge transcending political power emerges through Anu's actions rather than declaration, particularly in his "encrypted devotion" hidden as mathematics. The final image of marks that outlast kings offers resonance. However, the thematic resolution feels too tidy—Anu achieves both spiritual transcendence and earthly security without meaningful compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme emerges too explicitly through Elara's direct statements about resentment and broken pins. The final paragraph contains overt moralizing ("some resentments need only shift their form") that replaces earned resonance with thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of erasing boundaries emerges organically through the repair process and pays off when the sextant reveals impossible fruits and the dream becomes navigator rather than prisoner. The concept avoids explicit moralizing, though the final paragraph's description of the workshop's future reputation edges toward thematic summary rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "deciduous vows" emerges organically through the cathedral's persistence despite abandonment and Elara's attempts to bridge generational wisdom. The final line "Deciduous vows fall, but wisdom persists through seasons" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the earlier promise-breaking. However, some thematic statements feel slightly explicit ("Some vows are deciduous, but roots remain") rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of nonlinear inheritance and temporal boundaries emerges but through abstract philosophizing rather than dramatized particulars. Lines like "human minds weren't meant to perceive all of existence simultaneously" state the theme directly. The final enlightenment moment tells us about transformation without showing its cost or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of "unlearned lessons" as prisons resonates through concrete imagery of books with "stems and leaves" and consciousness "woven into the very pages." However, the final insight that "Some lessons can only be learned through rescue missions" reads as explicit moralizing rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. The thematic resolution feels too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of identity fragmentation emerges organically through Elara's chimera twin ability and culminates in her becoming vessel for forgotten names. The final image of the ship "now less abandoned than before" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of translating "confusion into clarity" emerges through Eleanor's archival work paralleling temporal investigation. The rope's braids offer a decent metaphor for time's interconnections. However, Croft's final line about "waiting for someone with your particular talents" feels convenient rather than earned through the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through the harmony-versus-chaos dynamic, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraph's "most powerful magic" statement (-0.5). The transformation from disruption to integration carries thematic weight but lacks complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of restoration proving that "connections persisted even when the world fell apart." The shard of hush as "space between what was and what could be" offers genuine conceptual depth. The final image of someone seeing the light and following it home resonates without moralizing, though it edges toward the sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges through concrete images (crystals releasing whispers, shadows marking time) rather than statements. However, Elthion's explicit vow "I will capture what we have been so that we might know what we can become" veers into thesis articulation, and the ending lacks resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of bringing light to darkness, with the fortress's transformation from isolation to renewal offering a non-literal answer to despair. The "serious playfulness" paradox enriches thematic texture. The final image of possibility filling the starless night resonates without stating a moral, successfully reweighting the opening's "gravity of hopelessness."

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    The transition/metamorphosis theme emerges through tidal pools and jade cicada imagery, creating coherent subtext. However, the insight that "texture of time was revealed not in continuous flow but in transitional moments" reads as abstract philosophizing rather than earned wisdom from specific struggle. Theme doesn't arise from dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The taxonomy of silences and their distinct "flavors" creates a coherent thematic exploration of how different spaces shape experience, with the gilded hush as transcendent culmination. The final juxtaposition of doll (comfort in confinement) and vessel (freedom of transcendence) offers resonant duality, though the transformation remains more asserted than earned through dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "teaching silence how to comfort," with the prism terrace becoming metaphor for transformation through refraction. The final image of "moving sanctuary" resonates without stating its moral, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of service over power emerges clearly through Elara's choice to prepare rather than claim the throne. The ruby flake and murals accumulate meaning toward this revelation. However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined—Elara never genuinely considers claiming power, so her "acceptance" lacks the weight of renunciation. The final image of ensuring "proper return" to rightful rulers resonates but would benefit from dramatized temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of "linking through scars" and teaching "suffocating how to breathe." The final image of walking "toward the breaking dawn" resonantly answers the question of isolation versus connection without stating a moral. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "loaded emptiness."

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transformation through pressure resonates throughout, from Maya's past financial ruin to the literal pressure-to-diamonds climax. The parallel dimensions reaching out to someone who "could see through illusions" creates thematic coherence. However, the resolution feels too neat—the metaphor becomes literal without complexity or ambiguity, and the final paragraph explicitly states the theme rather than letting it emerge through image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of truth revealed through resonance rather than force emerges organically from the action, avoiding explicit moralizing. The standing waves as metaphor for hidden vibrations of truth works well, though the final paragraphs edge toward over-explanation of thematic significance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the tension between withdrawn safety and dangerous knowledge, with the marionette program serving as metaphor for controlling possibilities beyond ordinary perception. The final image of Galen as "guardian of spaces between realities" offers a non-literal answer to questions of purpose and belonging. However, phrases like "factually mystical nature" and "immaterial truth" edge toward abstract philosophizing, and the resolution's declaration that he was "meant for something beyond ordinary service" approaches explicit moralizing rather than purely earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding connection through institutional fragments emerges organically from the investigation. The dust patterns work as a metaphor for tracing human presence. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("testament to how small kindnesses could echo through a lifetime"), and some thematic elements feel overly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of memory versus erasure emerges through concrete actions rather than statements, particularly in the image of faces "dancing under the starlight" in the lagoon's surface. The TrueComm key serves as a motif linking past communication systems to present resistance. However, the ending veers toward explicit moralizing ("The rebels continued to vanish and reappear...") that undermines the earned resonance of the preserved memories.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of silence versus sound emerges through the concrete use of negative space in music, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the thematic resolution is too tidy—the prophecy is simply "hushed" without exploring the complexity of what silencing prophecies might cost a community or whether some truths resist being hushed.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The transformation theme emerges through Elara's physical changes and the monuments to "forgotten things," creating resonance between preservation and change. The moonstone's appearance meaningfully reweights this pattern. However, the final message about "strengthening connection to the earth" reads as abstract thesis rather than earned wisdom from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between mechanical precision and natural rhythm. "Dance with chaos" crystallizes without preaching. The natural clocks embody the theme physically. Minor deduction for the slightly pat resolution where customers immediately appreciate the change.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The kintsugi theme emerges organically through action rather than declaration, particularly in "turning regret into luminous purpose." The weight of names motif threads throughout effectively. Slight deduction for the overly neat resolution where brokenness becomes beauty without exploring darker implications.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.6)
    The integration of laughter into healing emerges organically through Elias's personal tragedy and professional practice. The "luminous ache" between worlds resonates through specific details. However, the theme resolves too tidily - complex grief and decades of binding regret are solved through simple bell-ringing without earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of quantifying mercy emerges through Kai's search for "mathematics of mercy" and the forest as space for "ultraviolet penance." The final insight attempts conceptual repricing but lands as abstract philosophy ("mercy was a function of time over pain") rather than earned wisdom from dramatized struggle. Pattern of mathematical/algorithmic imagery coheres without achieving resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges through the recurring lighthouse/translator motif and gains resonance through the generational connection. However, the final image relies on abstract assertions ("histories long overlooked flood into the present") rather than concrete dramatization of what these histories are or why they matter.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of bridging worlds emerges organically through Marcus's technical expertise applied to supernatural phenomena. The "weightless burden" motif effectively captures the paradox of seeing what others cannot. The final image of "space between worlds wasn't empty at all, merely waiting for someone with the right tools" offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though it edges toward tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and transformation, with the bottled whisper embodying this paradox. The ending offers resonance without stating a moral, as the "rustling awakenings" suggest knowledge cannot be perfectly contained. However, abstract phrasing ("negotiable reality," "eternity compressed") occasionally replaces concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of the shattered vase reflecting "beauty in their fragments," paralleling civilization's capacity to "break and reshape themselves." The ending offers a non-literal answer about truth as "a constellation of possibilities" without moralizing. The concept of reimagining history through poetic interpretation deepens through concrete action rather than abstract statement.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preserving beauty against decay emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The concept of "mending what wasn't torn" offers philosophical depth about prevention versus repair. The ending resonates with light conquering darkness, though it resolves perhaps too neatly—"even the smallest light could push back the darkest night" edges toward platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of seeking "where explanations fail" emerges organically through action and discovery. The final paragraph's connection between petrichor collection and transformation offers genuine resonance, though "the impossible journey that had led her home" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "timewoven alliances" - connections across generations - emerges clearly through the visions and sculpture. However, it's stated too explicitly ("timewoven alliances her grandmother had spoken of") rather than arising from dramatized struggle. The ending reweights the archway's meaning but lacks emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden transformation emerges through the glass/flower parallel, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the insight about "invisible connections" and "hidden symphony" tends toward abstraction rather than arising from concrete struggle, and the resolution feels tidy without acknowledging what this knowledge costs.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of bridging generational trauma through inherited memory emerges through the grandfather connection and diary encryption. However, the resolution—publishing history—feels pat rather than complex; the story tells us about "wounds that still bled beneath the skin of progress" without showing specific contemporary consequences or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of true transformation requiring internal rather than external change emerges clearly, but the story states this too directly: "physical restoration alone could never truly revive a civilization." The amber bottle's metaphorical meaning feels forced rather than arising from concrete action. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "false comfort" and "meaningful work" rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and prophecy, with the wax cylinder serving as both recording medium and oracle. The story resists simple moralizing about memory or duty. The final image of the silent foghorn "just as had been foretold" creates resonance without stating its meaning. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic labeling ("archaeologist of human emotion").

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the preservation/experience paradox without explicit statement, culminating in Anya becoming "the bridge between preservation and experience." The texture of borrowed time revealing as "the texture of herself, fragile and yet eternal" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of ancient wisdom versus modern technology emerges organically through Elias's methods and colleagues' skepticism. "True wisdom lay not in collecting more data, but in better interpreting the patterns" resonates without preaching. The ending image of the mountain "trying to talk" provides thematic closure, though it lacks the complexity that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    The vulnerability-as-strength theme emerges through Elion's openness to cosmic connection, and the yellow glass effectively bridges physical and spiritual perception. However, the resolution lands in abstract pronouncements ("eternal dance of creation and dissolution") rather than earned wisdom from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of silence holding more truth than speech emerges organically through the covenant's requirements and the recluse's transformation into its keeper. The "weight of unspoken words" gains layers through specific examples—unvoiced apologies, unexpressed gratitude, unconfessed love. The final image of ghostly smiles suggesting approval offers resonant non-literal answer to whether silence can preserve meaning. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract handling of how silence operates as preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving and transmitting knowledge emerges through the garage sale messages conceit, which offers originality. However, the thematic resolution relies on direct statement ("helping to weave a new understanding") rather than earned resonance through dramatized struggle. The final image attempts lyricism but lacks the specific cost that would make the theme resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in incompleteness emerges clearly through the kite metaphor and recurring imagery of transitions. However, it develops through assertion and observation rather than dramatized struggle. The ending offers no resonant answer beyond restating the initial philosophy—"in the incomplete, we find our truest selves"—without earning this wisdom through specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete work of bridge-building between species, avoiding explicit statements. The final image of the orchard as "shared wisdom" resonates without moralizing. The copper wire becomes literal and metaphorical language. Minor deduction for slightly predictable arc of sacrifice-for-legacy without more complex moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of homecoming/return emerges through repetition and the final assertion that "all beings seek to return to their origin," but this arrives as statement rather than earned insight. The story gestures toward complexity (artificial vs. authentic pilgrimage) but resolves into a tidy moral. The fly amber symbolism feels forced rather than organic to the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of restoration through patient action emerges organically from events, with "narrow vastness" crystallizing the paradox of small actions yielding infinite change. The submerged concord metaphor effectively links land and sea healing, and the ending reweights the opening journey without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the riddle "What distance can be made close by the one who sees in spectrum?" - answered not through proximity but shared understanding. The preserved leaves as "both halves of the same autumn day" resonates without overstatement. The bloodhound's shift from finding death to finding life provides thematic depth. Slight deduction for the explicit final message about home.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through heavy-handed symbolism (compass rose as moral direction, sketching as preservation) and explicit statements about finding "true north" within. The final paragraph delivers the theme directly: "her true north had been within her all along." The piece gestures toward complexity about isolation and duty but resolves into a tidy self-help epiphany without earned resonance. Subtext is minimal—most meaning sits on the surface through direct narration.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    The chess-as-strategy-game metaphor connects to the larger theme of navigating life's mysteries, though the master's explicit statement "life is a strategy game" borders on thematic echo (-0.4). The ending image of Kael pocketing the sundial while wondering about future adventures resonates with his established character arc of embracing the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of missing pawns representing forgotten citizens, with the materialized pawn offering a non-literal answer about memory's selective preservation. The concept of "small gestures" gains complexity through Elara's ruthless selection process—"she couldn't save everyone's memories." The final image of existing "between memory and forgetting" resists tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of home as connection rather than place emerges organically through Maven's journey. The mercury glass, lost language stone, and feather accumulate meaning without heavy-handed symbolism. The final revelation that "home shaped itself around those who learned to see beyond the surface" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior searching.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The redemption theme emerges clearly but through direct statement ("redemption had been his all along—he had only needed to forgive himself") rather than earned realization. The tapestry-as-memory metaphor has potential but remains abstract. The story tells us about forgiveness rather than dramatizing the specific cost of achieving it.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of singular truth versus multiplicity emerges clearly through the refraction metaphor and echoing canyon. However, the story states its thesis too directly ("truth, like light, only gained power when allowed to refract") rather than earning insight through dramatized struggle. The final image of endless echoes as "liberation" provides some resonance but lacks the non-literal complexity that would elevate thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The kintsugi metaphor emerges organically through Marcel's interaction with the damaged statue, avoiding explicit thematic statements until the earned final insight. The theme of finding beauty in brokenness resonates through concrete details like "constellation of defects" and develops complexity through the paradox of necessary damage.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "temporary eternity" emerges organically through concrete particulars—the painted seashell preserved by nature, the changing harbor, fading memories. The final synthesis that temporary eternity is "a precious balance" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The recurring mirror/reflection motif charges the closure, though some thematic statements edge toward the explicit ("time itself had carved the message more prominently").

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of gentle power versus force emerges through the whisper/shout contrast and finds some resonance in the captain's conversion. However, the ending explicitly states the moral ("Only pure intentions, delivered with that screaming tenderness...") rather than letting it emerge from particulars. The concept feels more asserted than earned through scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the "geography of loss" becoming "navigable terrain" and the reverse migration as spiritual return. The patchwork navigator's scarred body mirrors the fragmented routes being reconnected. The final image of building "not just pathways, but hope" resonates without stating a moral, though it edges toward explicit thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between connection and boundaries in a post-virus world. The final realization that relics help "navigate empathy with intention" rather than permanently block it offers genuine complexity. The image of the orchard as "both broken and beautiful" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages about Dr. Finch's textbooks edge toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of isolation versus connection emerges through the concrete image of the Edelweiss bridging two lives, with the final gesture transforming solitary lighthouse-keeping into witnessed human connection. The borrowed memories avoid abstraction by providing specific sensory details. The "release suffering back to the sea" insight feels slightly overstated compared to the subtlety elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The map dealer examining unmapped territory of his own life creates strong thematic resonance without explicit moralizing. The doorways showing "paths not taken" effectively literalize the central metaphor. The final image of Elias drawing "new maps of his own making" reweights the opening's "parchment ghosts" beautifully, though the "doorway of decisions" concept borders on over-explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of authentic self versus imposed role emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The ending line about "promise—the rediscovery of a self long buried" borders on explicit moralizing (-0.5), though the grotto scenes earn some thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of scientific precision and romantic possibility, with the nautilus spiral serving as a mathematical-poetic bridge. The final image of creating art that captures "the weight between words and the transformation that follows" resonates without explicit moralizing. The story explores how knowledge transforms perspective through concrete imagery rather than abstract statements.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of graves as cradles and the cartography of consciousness metaphor. The final image of dawn over ancient yet perpetually new peaks offers a non-literal answer to mortality's meaning. However, phrases like "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" occasionally state the theme too directly rather than letting it emerge purely through image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of finding new ways to perceive meaning after loss emerges organically through the parallel professions of midwifery and clock repair. The connection "Perhaps we both help people transition" resonates without becoming overly explicit, though the thematic work could deepen beyond this single crystallizing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through transformation of trauma into wisdom without explicit moralizing. The childhood knot-tying superstition and grandmother's teachings layer meaning, with the final image of "memory turned to wisdom" resonating without stating a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of incomplete redemption emerges organically through the "incomplete composition" left behind and the paradox of "gossip-column exorcism." The metaphor about "Time tiptoes on broken glass" and Beatrice's "scissors" line create resonance without heavy-handedness. Yet the resolution tends toward neat moral closure rather than embracing the promised complexity of "imperfect miracles."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of unity versus separation emerges through the concept of "spiral arbitration" reconciling opposites, but relies heavily on abstract declaration rather than dramatized particulars. The dictionary commanding "Unify" and the final merger feel prescribed rather than earned through scene work. The story tells us about cosmic illusions of separateness without showing their concrete effects.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of time as presence versus commodity emerges through Arlo's transformation and teaching. However, the final paragraph's explicit statements ("Clocks measure what we give them") and the unearned wisdom about "meaning not moments" reduce subtext to direct thesis, particularly damaging at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of security through understanding rather than walls emerges organically from the concrete action of creating permeable barriers. The transformation from "intrusion detection" to "mutual guardianship" offers a non-literal answer to the security question. The physics metaphor occasionally strains toward abstraction ("mathematics of boundaries") but mostly stays grounded in the specific light-communication discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the probability/gambling dichotomy and crystallizes in "beautiful uncertainty." The cryptic subway equations work as a motif for anonymous human connection. However, the resolution toward "peace" feels unearned—Elena's insight about "widening perspectives responsibly" reads more like thesis statement than dramatized revelation emerging from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of endings learning to begin emerges through the concrete mechanism of wrong numbers reaching abandoned lines, with the glass harmonica disc serving as conductor of change. The final image of Elias "no longer haunted but harmonious" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the thematic resolution tends toward the abstract—"testament to the power of reaching out"—rather than remaining grounded in specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preservation versus progress emerges through concrete details like the walnut-ink formula and blooming jetty, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the "weight of small moments" philosophy gets stated repeatedly rather than demonstrated through accumulating particulars, and the final image of walking toward "whatever new context awaited" offers resignation rather than resonant transformation of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of connection through shared stories emerges organically from the rumor-spreading plot, and the moon rock's transformation from real keepsake to fake catalyst carries thematic weight. However, the insight that "the cure he'd sought wasn't the rumor but the sharing of it" arrives as direct statement rather than earned revelation. The reciprocity concept appears but doesn't constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of blindness as different perception emerges through concrete details like the ring's warmth and musical trail. However, the ending explicitly states the moral ("blindness had never been a disability") rather than letting the image carry meaning. The stillpoint concept shifts from location to state but this conceptual repricing lacks dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "threshing meaning from experience" emerges organically through Elara's transformation of regret into wisdom. The pen as a tool for "gently unbending" rather than rewriting history offers nuance, though the final paragraphs edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of creating lasting music from ephemeral silence. The mother's backstory enriches without overwhelming, and the final image resonantly answers the central question about art's permanence versus the artist's erasure. The "joyful sorrow" concept integrates naturally throughout without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "destruction and renewal" emerges through the tapestry fragment and Maya's arc, with "volcanic tenderness" providing a conceptual framework. However, the final moralizing ("Like all great stories...this one contains both destruction and renewal") explicitly states what should resonate through image alone, undermining subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of entangled consciousness resisting separation. The "auric lagoon under starlight" functions as both literal goal and thematic image of connection transcending physical boundaries. The ending offers a resonant answer about love and defiance reshaping reality, though it edges toward explicit statement in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme emerges organically through the contrast between Marlo's quiet expertise and Vance's loud authority. The zodiac coin and folded maps accumulate meaning, and the ending offers a resonant answer about different forms of power, though it doesn't quite achieve the complexity needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "teaching darkness the value of stars" emerges through the light-weaving action and creates some resonance. However, it relies heavily on explicit thematic statements ("to teach darkness the value of stars" appears verbatim three times) rather than letting meaning emerge from dramatized conflict. The "silent empathy" concept gets stated but not tested through actual character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chess-as-thinking metaphor coheres but remains surface-level, lacking complexity. The theme emerges through repetitive phrases ("forests of second thoughts" appears four times) rather than through dramatized struggle, and the ending's wholesale transformation feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of authentic self-realization emerges through concrete actions rather than statements, with the scrimshaw "unlocking guarded hearts" literalized through Mara's transformation. The final image of being "welcomed home" to one's true nature resonates without moralizing. The recurring water/dissolution imagery effectively reweights from constraint to liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of blank-faced performance creating authentic emotional space. The dried flowers and wooden figures embody the tension between preservation and loss without explicit moralizing. The final image of turbines as "witnesses to the quiet revolution" resonantly answers the central question about emotional expression post-mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of artistic freedom versus restriction emerges through the ban/freedom frame and boundary dissolution, but resolves into abstract proclamation about "interconnectedness" without earned complexity. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("boundaries were not walls but thresholds") rather than letting it emerge from dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding "beauty in imperfection" emerges organically through Elara's colorblindness giving her unique perception and Gideon's arthritic hands forcing acceptance. The final revelation that "awakenings come not when we demand them, but when we arrange our lives to receive them" resonates without moralizing. The reciprocal nature of bartered awakenings - giving to receive unexpectedly - adds thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of connection across time emerges through concrete objects and sounds, avoiding direct statement. However, the final sections drift into abstract philosophizing ("texture of connection that bound all things together") that replaces earned resonance with conceptual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The phoenix-from-ashes theme emerges organically through the tattoo stencil motif and Elena's transformation. The piece avoids explicit moralizing until the final paragraph, where it edges toward summary ("proving that even the most withered souls"). The recurring image of "withering to bloom" provides thematic coherence though it lacks the specificity of lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of inherited wisdom versus systematic analysis emerges organically through the grandmother's measuring tape and Elias's methodical documentation. The cards revealing "underlying structures of human consciousness" avoids explicit moralizing while building toward the idea that some mysteries require collaborative understanding. The final image of "two minds joined to solve a mystery too vast for one person" resonates without preaching, though it could push further into ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation requiring dissolution - Elara must lose herself to save the past. The "end of innocence" motif recurs meaningfully, and "anguished joy" captures the story's emotional duality. The final image of "touching the eternal" resonates without moralizing, though some thematic statements ("systematic forgetting") feel overly explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of "love's persistence beyond the boundaries of life and death" emerges through concrete shadow movements and Elara's evolving understanding, avoiding direct statement until earned by the recognition scene. The final image of Elara as "not just a keeper of light's progression, but a witness to love's endurance" reweights all prior observation work.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    The shedding/transformation metaphor through the chameleon is coherent and the parallel between creature and handler clear, but the theme relies on explicit statements ("Reconstructing isn't about forgetting, it's about transformation"). The final image of the chameleon's healed tail tip offers some resonance but lacks the non-literal depth that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of healing through integration rather than excavation emerges organically from Elara's journey with the hourglass and plants. The recurring scar imagery effectively links physical and emotional healing without explicit moralizing until late passages. The final image of Elara as "creator of new beginnings" resonates thematically, though phrases like "honoring the stories they told" edge toward abstraction rather than earned particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of preserved emotion in liminal spaces emerges organically through the film strip's dual nature as entertainment medium and emotional archive. The concept avoids direct moralizing, and the final image of projecting essence rather than mere images offers resonant closure. The piece earns its wisdom about love existing "in the pauses between heartbeats."

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of transforming overwhelming input into creative flow emerges through the astronomical metaphor system, avoiding direct moralizing until the explicit statement "To free trapped creativity, she now understood, was not about silencing the world but learning to distill its infinite voices." The final image of Elara as "moonstruck dreamer reborn" offers resonance but lacks the specificity to fully reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the concrete opposition of dreamless existence versus cultivated hope, with the recurring spark/light imagery charging the final seed sprouting "toward the impossible light." The piece resists tidy resolution—the guard continues his mission rather than achieving completion. The final image offers a non-literal answer about persistence creating possibility in broken worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of consciousness as landscape emerges organically through the mechanical forest metaphor. The final recognition that "the wild frontier would expand beyond his lone exploration" resonates without moralizing, though the philosophical insights occasionally drift toward abstraction rather than remaining grounded in specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of dormant courage awaiting activation emerges organically through the concrete discovery of sleeping dragons, avoiding abstract moralizing. The shift from external service (ferrying others) to internal awakening (carrying courage) resonates without explicit statement. The final image of invisible dragons as "living star-stamps of potential" effectively reweights the opening's ferry service, though the piece could probe deeper into why courage remains unused.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete discovery of the bolt and names, avoiding abstract moralizing. The final image of snow "dancing with newfound rhythm" resonantly answers whether safety is worth silence without stating it. "Frostbitten hope" perfectly captures the fragile possibility in his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of self-deception versus external threat emerges through the pretender's true nature, and the library's collapse mirrors internal transformation. Yet the story explicitly states its thesis ("not unmasked a pretender to the throne but had unmasked herself"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of planetary cycles reclaiming human intervention emerges effectively through the torn atlas and rising seas imagery. The concept of "periodically eternal" cycles resonates through coral bleaching and recovery patterns. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("their time had passed in the great cycle") rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of reconnection between technology and spirituality emerges through the juxtaposition of ancient stones in a modern ruin, but resolves into simplistic mystical salvation. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "a revolution of the spirit that would transform their world," abandoning subtlety. The piece gestures toward complexity with "graveyard of technological ambition" but ultimately presents spiritual awakening as costless universal solution.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of evolution versus tradition emerges organically through Maya's journey, avoiding explicit moralizing. The embryo works as a concrete metaphor for potential and change. However, the thematic resolution feels too neat - "honor both her heritage and her vision" lacks the complexity and lingering ambiguity that would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The pearl metaphor elegantly unifies trauma processing with natural imagery, avoiding simple recovery narratives. The ending's image of Maya "frozen against the cliffside" after releasing the photograph resonates without moralizing, though phrases like "to anchor optimism in realism" occasionally state the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of embracing fragmentation rather than seeking perfection emerges organically through imagery and action. The recurring motifs (threads, fragments, luminescent ache) accumulate meaning, and the final realization reweights the opening despair. However, the thematic resolution feels somewhat neat—the story explicitly states its lesson about "finding meaning in the fractured pieces" rather than letting the image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the exploration of time's malleability during crisis, culminating in the insight "We change our relationship to it during moments of crisis." The ink patterns "physically personified time's malleability" creates a concrete metaphor. However, the final whispered revelation feels slightly too explicit, and the theme could resonate more through image rather than stated understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of truth versus control emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with Elena's whispered "Knowledge cries out to be free" serving as crystallization rather than thesis. The ending reweights the archive from preserver to liberator space, though some thematic articulation feels explicit ("revolutionary potential").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of cultivation versus destruction emerges through concrete details like the repurposed sandbag, but remains surface-level without complexity. The story's insistence that Rhiannon provides "anchor through botanical artistry" and weaves "continuity through chaos" reads as authorial assertion rather than earned resonance. The final image offers no non-literal answer to any central question.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "voicing silence" and the desire "to touch something beyond oneself," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the garden "humming with the remnant of his success" offers resonant closure, though the abstract nature of divine encounter prevents deeper emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of truth-seeking and family legacy emerges through the investigation, with the recurring "orbits of regret" providing some resonance. However, the final realization about intervention ("showing people what they've refused to see") arrives as summary rather than earned insight, and the thematic resolution feels tidy rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the amber's dual nature (prison/sanctuary), the translation of cries into lullaby, and silence transformed into felt vibration. The final image of musical note constellations replacing star maps resonates without stating its meaning. The piece avoids moralizing while exploring grief's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of finding meaning in chaos emerges organically through Silas's artistic process, with the sand mandala serving as both literal and metaphorical pattern-making within disorder. The final image of embracing chaos as "the beginning of wisdom" resonates without moralizing, though the phrase "beautiful but unsettling" describing lilac unease edges toward telling.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of renewal through "aberrant mercy" emerges organically from Elias's actions rather than declaration, particularly in the paradox of "warm coldness" and finding beauty in destruction. The final image of the brightened mosaic offers a non-literal answer about persistence through catastrophe. However, phrases like "We are not the fire. We are what rises from the ashes" edge toward explicit moralizing that weakens the otherwise implicit thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of attachment versus release emerges through Silas's encore-seeking nature and final dissolution. The tarot Star card and recurring performance motifs support hope/redemption themes, culminating in the cyclical ending with a future tenor, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("enduring nature of hope itself").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of healing through unconventional means emerges but resolves into explicit moralizing: "not in magic, but in the extraordinary potential of the human spirit to heal and transform." The final paragraph tells the theme directly rather than allowing it to resonate through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of bridging unknown and known emerges through concrete action—Maya literally descending into darkness to retrieve knowledge. The elm fossil as "transitional object" resonates beyond its literal function, and the final image of Maya carrying this "factually mystical guide" reweights her earlier compulsion to explore. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, though the revelation sequence could trust more in implication.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of shared wisdom transforming individual fate emerges organically through the button cataloging and grows coherently. The final image of the warehouse as wisdom-sharing center resonates with the opening solitude, though the transformation arrives without examining what is lost when prophecy becomes malleable.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of reconstruction after betrayal emerges organically through concrete images—snow codes as self-conversation, the pillbox transforming from emergency documents to family photo to future tokens. The final insight that fractures become "maps rather than failures" resonates without moralizing. The recurring motifs (silver hush, mist, codes) accumulate meaning that charges the descent, though "fixing what's broken" occasionally surfaces too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The palimpsest metaphor effectively captures layered history and accumulated meaning at the crossing. Theme emerges through the coachman's role as "keeper of thresholds" between worlds, though it tends toward abstract declaration ("wisdom often hides in plain sight"). The final image of continuing vigil resonates but lacks the specificity to fully earn its thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of nurturing/kindness as resistance to entropy emerges organically through concrete images (flowers tilting toward presence, bees responding to intention). The final insight about "loyal memory of love, awaiting its counterpart to bloom" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, though it edges toward the poetic-abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    The light/dark metaphor emerges organically through concrete actions - using the bitting gauge tooth to redirect moonlight. The theme of inherited purpose and connection across generations develops through specifics rather than abstractions. The final image of the illuminated alcove offers a non-literal answer about legacy and service. Some thematic statements edge toward directness ("The garden needs light in dark seasons").

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of images and Elena's journey from fragmentation to wholeness. The contrast between Aethenian control and necessary coexistence resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elena's internal clock replacing the brass sundial beautifully reweights earlier material, showing independence achieved through connection rather than isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.6)
    The connection theme emerges through the art installation and thrush's nest, avoiding explicit moralizing until "everything was connected, if only you knew how to look." The spiral motif links to "constellations, fingerprints, and the spiral of distant galaxies," creating resonance. However, the final third shifts into abstract declarations about universal connection without grounding in specific dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of perception manipulation emerges through events, and the ending suggests humanity awakening from collective delusion. However, the resolution tends toward explicit moralizing ("humanity finally aware of the cosmic game") rather than allowing complexity, and the tricksters remain abstract villains without nuanced motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of liberation from imposed constraints emerges through concrete details like the Great Sealing and forbidden surface world. The grandfather's tears and described colors add emotional texture. The final portal revealing "not the surface world she expected, but another realm entirely" offers genuine thematic complexity about the nature of freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of awakening dormant empathy emerges through Elena's stated motivation and the community's selective forgetting, but resolution occurs through exposition ("Justice has been dormant") rather than earned resonance. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about empathy and closure, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary that triggers the anti-pattern penalty for theme statements in lieu of dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of vindication across generations emerges through the parallel between ancestor's exile and current discovery. However, the story states its thesis too directly: "His exile was reversible, not just in reputation but in purpose." The final image of dormant systems awakening carries some resonance but lacks the specificity to fully reweight earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transformation and "pixelated amnesty" emerges through recurring imagery (glass flake, scaffold wrap, vanishing) but resolves into explicit moralizing: "I will recount this impossible journey, for all who stand at crossroads." The concept of sculpting possibility from "never" connects to Elias's brother wound but this backstory element feels grafted rather than dramatized. The final image of Elias playing music between worlds carries some resonance despite the heavy-handed thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of inherited patterns versus self-determination emerges organically through the foreign currency collection and "paths circle back" motif. The final insight about starting points reweights earlier material effectively. However, Elias's explanation to Marcus about compass, map, and currencies reads as explicit thematic statement rather than earned subtext. The piece achieves thematic coherence but lacks the subtlety demanded at higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of shared burden versus isolation emerges clearly but resolves into tidy moralizing: "some knowledge was meant to be discovered not in isolation but together." The final paragraph explicitly states the theme rather than letting it resonate through image. The healing-words concept never demonstrates actual restoration, remaining conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of hidden truths emerges through the mirror metaphor and glamour revelation, but resolves too neatly into "some truths are worth any price to uncover." The concept of discovering "what mirrors don't show" works symbolically but lacks complexity—the mentor simply hid her appearance, without moral ambiguity. The final moralizing paragraph explicitly states themes rather than letting them emerge from events.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges through the dream/reality boundary concept and the idea of necessary grounding ("root-bound") enabling expanded vision. However, the final realization arrives as direct statement ("not meant to separate dreams from reality but to allow them to coexist") rather than earned through dramatized particulars. The piece tells its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the death/life intertwining and the concept of mending souls through sacrifice, avoiding explicit moralizing. The burned tarot card's transformation from Tower to new purpose carries thematic weight. However, the resolution lacks complexity—the memory's successful trammeling arrives without meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in small moments after loss emerges through the cloth's transformation from "close to nothing" to "everything." However, the explicit thematic statements ("discovering purpose after loss") appear multiple times, violating the show-don't-tell principle. The story tells us its meaning rather than letting it emerge from the concrete situation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges through the physics of transition metaphor and the continuity of knowledge across generations, avoiding explicit moralizing. The seed and arbor work as non-literal elements exploring transformation. However, the ending doesn't offer a resonant answer to the central question—Elara simply embarks on her quest without the theme deepening through specific experience or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of identity fluidity and accepting contradictions emerges clearly through the lunar cycle framework. "Each story preserved adds another layer to who we might become tomorrow" resonates conceptually. However, the theme arrives through philosophical statements rather than earned revelation—the librarian already knows and accepts everything from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of connection versus isolation emerges through concrete images (bunkers as "monuments to humanity's expectation of ending," the pearl absorbing "abandoned hopes"). The confessions-as-key mechanism offers an interesting conceptual layer. However, the ending's assertion that "disconnection...could be healed, if only someone was willing to listen" states the theme too directly, and the transformation from inspector to healer feels thematically neat rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between diverted rivers and medication "diverting" natural grief. The accordion as the brother's instrument adds resonance without heavy-handed symbolism. "Some currents cannot be charted until we are ready to drown in them" crystallizes the theme through earned insight rather than platitude, though occasional abstractions ("terrain of her own soul") weaken specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of unspoken words emerges through the library's concept but resolves into abstract philosophy ("some words gain power only in the absence of their speaking") without earned specificity. The story states its thesis explicitly in the penultimate paragraph rather than letting it emerge from concrete action. The final "unspoken gift" of laughter feels unearned without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of preservation through transformation emerges organically through the violin's propagation—not hiding history but allowing it to multiply and evolve. The "perforated destiny" transforms from weakness to opportunity. The final image of "cold, living crystal" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's "cold vacancy."

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of preservation versus loss emerges organically through Elara's work at the "threshold of stillness." The emerald chips as vessels for captured souls and the recurring aurora light create coherent thematic resonance, though the piece doesn't complicate its central question or offer surprising insight.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    The cycle of rebirth theme emerges through the hairpin's generational significance and the grotto as threshold between worlds, but resolution comes through direct statement ("The cycle continues") rather than dramatized realization. The ending's claim about becoming "the source herself" tells rather than emerges from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between certainty and nuance, professional distance and human connection. The wind chimes as a system for interpreting complexity resonates metaphorically. However, phrases like "doubt was not the enemy of truth, but its companion" edge toward explicit moralizing, and the theme would benefit from more embodied contradiction rather than philosophical summation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vanishing/appearing paradox resonates through concrete images—the stone sinking, ripples spreading, the grotto becoming visible—avoiding abstract philosophizing. The theme emerges naturally from the teaching moment, and Maya's final transformation embodies rather than states the lesson, though some lines edge toward explicit thematic statement ("To teach vanishing to appear was to teach the ultimate paradox of existence").

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "navigation without moving" emerges through direct statement rather than dramatized events. The story tells us about harmonic connections and dimensional pathways without showing how these concepts affect Kael's specific choices. The final image of the pulsing arrowhead waiting for the next seeker provides some resonance but lacks the particulars that would make it memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of authentic creativity versus automated perfection emerges organically through Elias's journey and the contrast between prescribed cloud patterns and the garden folly's emotional colors. The "brilliant dimness" motif effectively captures the paradox of standardized magic—technically perfect but lacking soul. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, letting the image of the small group practicing forgotten arts carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the connection between light and sound, with the final image of multicolored flames making Hemingway's gift visible to all. The "luminous vows" concept effectively bridges the personal and universal without heavy-handed moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of finding meaning in cosmic chaos emerges through Loran's interpretation of static and coins. The backwards prophecy creates interesting complexity. However, the final revelation that "the universe doesn't end in darkness—it folds inward to begin again" arrives as assertion rather than earned insight, and the resolution feels too tidy for the cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the naming conceit—making the terrifying manageable through language. The traveling poet's wisdom about crystallization provides earned insight rather than platitude. Final image of the observatory holding "names for the future" resonates without moralizing. The piece avoids tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence about transformation through understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "lukewarm" adequacy succeeding where greater power failed. The final image of the perfectly lukewarm bell tone resonates thematically without explicit moralizing. The concept that "even the lukewarm have their place" develops through action rather than assertion, though the ending paragraph edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between official history and lived memory, with the reservoir literally and metaphorically submerging truth. The liqueur label and photographs work as concrete vehicles for abstract ideas about legacy and silenced voices. The final image of stories "spinning silence into meaning" resonates without explicit moralizing, though "false narrative" edges toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of uniting logic and intuition emerges through the ritual's imagery (mathematical starling patterns meeting mystical transformation) but relies heavily on direct statement rather than dramatized complexity. The piece explicitly names its theme multiple times ("harmonize logic and intuition," "scientific understanding merged with mystical experience") without developing counter-arguments or costs, and the final achievement feels thematically neat rather than resonantly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of isolated vigilance and trust emerges through repetition but lacks complexity. "Preserve trust under pressure" arrives as explicit moralizing rather than earned through scene. The pattern seeker's burden could apply to any watchman story without this world's specific pressures charging the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The complementary opposites theme emerges organically through Maya's numbness versus the brain's potential for feeling, and the duplicate consciousness question raises genuine philosophical stakes. The final image of exponential consciousness possibilities resonates, though the resolution tilts toward abstract hope rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme about creativity and "orthogonal approaches" is stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging from dramatized events. The corpse flower metaphor (requiring "unique conditions to flourish") parallels creative process too neatly. The final paragraph's moralizing about "innovation flows not through predictable channels" replaces scene work with thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of using industrial equipment to create ghostly lullabies—memory and absence given sonic form. The final reframing of "absence itself could be a sanctuary for memory" offers resonant closure without moralizing. However, the piece leans on abstract emotional language ("unspoken sorrow," "vanished joy") rather than building theme purely through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "making friends with uncertainty" and finding home as "a state of consciousness one carried within." The concept of boundaries as "invitations" rather than barriers resonates through concrete garden imagery. The final wisdom about embracing the unknown avoids platitude through specific grounding in the guardian's centuries of practice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of creative destruction versus preservation emerges organically through Elias's transformation of the broken crozier. The final image of "not magic but evolution" and the transformed staff as "both torch and compass" resonates without stating a moral. The frozen bloom metaphor pays off well, though some thematic statements like "true creation sometimes required the courage to destroy first" edge toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of beginnings within endings emerges through the fragment's journey and city's awakening, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the concept remains abstract without concrete particulars that would make this philosophical position cost something specific to Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of fractured identity seeking wholeness emerges organically through the parallel timeline concept and Liam's split existence, with the empty/filling hourglass providing concrete symbolism. The ending's "permanent transient" status offers resonant complexity—wholeness achieved through perpetual in-betweenness—though some passages veer toward explicit thematic statement ("miracle of their existence").

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of connection as creative act rather than discovery emerges organically through the sinew thread metaphor and gallery transformations. The "rational enchantment" concept effectively bridges logic and emotion. Yet the final insight about weaving connection feels slightly pat, lacking the ambiguity that would elevate thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the concrete challenge of finding cosmic connection from ocean depths. The anchor chain link effectively embodies the "unfolded horizons" concept without forcing allegory. Kael's final address to students resonates thematically, though the line "waiting for us to learn their language" edges toward explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that the dead's unfinished business can save the living. The photograph's dual purpose - memento and evidence - offers resonant non-literal answer to why the dead call. Final image of "watchfulness beyond death" reweights prior material effectively without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of remembering the forgotten emerges through Elara's actions rather than statement, with the undersea cables serving as metaphor for connection beyond death. The ending image of "sacred silence between" waves resonates without moralizing. Her commitment despite isolation ("cost her friends and career") adds thematic weight to duty versus personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transformation through error emerges clearly, particularly in "failure isn't the end but a transformation." However, the insight arrives through direct statement rather than earned dramatization, and the final coffee-making gesture feels disconnected from the thematic weight it's meant to carry.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of translating texture to sound, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of preservation versus transformation resonates throughout. The ending achieves thematic closure without stating its meaning, though it edges toward tidiness in resolving the "curse" misunderstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "harmony untamed" theme emerges through the garden's ecosystem and cryptid behaviors, avoiding direct statement. However, the final paragraphs drift into abstract philosophizing ("Perhaps someday humanity would be ready") rather than letting particulars carry meaning. The cosmic joke motivation gets summary treatment rather than dramatized irony.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the beauty/mechanism dichotomy without explicit moralizing. The locust shell (hollow yet resonant) works as a governing metaphor for transformation and renewal. The ending offers a non-literal answer through crystalline vines climbing metal bridges—beauty and mechanism synthesizing rather than one defeating the other.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bottled thunderstorm serves as a multilayered metaphor—temporary separation, contained violence, and the promise that "storms eventually end." The theme emerges through action rather than statement, particularly in how "absences" become links in Elias's network. The ending's image of the child watching the storm while trusting in reunion resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding possibility in silence emerges organically through the carpenter's journey from mute craftsman to magical creator, with the final line about "creating magic from the misting hush" offering resonant closure. The story avoids explicit moralizing, though the transformation from silence to song could develop more complexity beyond the binary of silence/expression.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the synthesis of scientific and poetic elements, particularly in "The place where stories live isn't a location. It's the space between." The concept of stories as living entities develops through concrete images rather than assertion, and the final connection between Margaret and the stories offers a non-literal answer about preservation and understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of presence within absence emerges organically through the photography/light motif, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of continuing "their conversation in the language they now both understood" resonates without explaining, and "luminous absence" becomes literal rather than metaphorical in a satisfying conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of mental locks and the concrete act of liberation: "the lock is only in your mind." The transformation of the hair lock into starlight thread creates resonant imagery without explicit moralizing. The final line "Another heart unlocked, another truth set free" risks thematic summary but remains grounded in Silas's character voice and the story's established metaphor system.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of folklore-as-lived-experience emerges through Elara's transformation from skeptical academic to participant. The final revelation about memory thieves as "preservers" attempts complexity but arrives through exposition ("Understanding washed over her") rather than dramatized discovery. The ending's assertion that she's "restored and complete" tells rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between physical backward walking and metaphorical retreat/return, culminating in "exile preserves what it removes." The shadow metaphor ("endures even when separated from its source") enriches without over-explaining. The final image of the library becoming Prisha's sanctuary resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of preserving wonder emerges through the seed transformation and generational inheritance, avoiding explicit moralizing. The grandmother's quote and final image of future trees bearing "fruits of preserved wonder" create resonance. However, the abstract nature of "wonder" and "essence" prevents deeper complexity - what specific wonders are being preserved?

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of broken things finding purpose through their damage emerges organically as Elena's fractured state makes her "sensitive to the fractures in others." The net serves as a concrete metaphor for entangled suffering that must be methodically released. The ending achieves resonance without stating a moral, as Elena's gift transforms from burden to purpose through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the tension between documentation and experience, with the torn map becoming a "threshold rather than barrier." The story resists simple knowledge-recovery narrative, instead exploring why certain knowledge resists mapping. The final insight that "the most profound cartography often occurs not on paper, but in the human heart" resonates without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the snow globe's transformation and the reinterpretation of "home" as a state between frequencies. The physics metaphor for grief and transition avoids sentimentality while offering genuine insight. The final image of the empty globe resonates without explicit moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of articulating unspoken needs emerges organically through the ghost-human connection, with the graffiti art serving as effective metaphor for coded communication. However, the resolution tends toward abstract satisfaction without confronting complexity - both beings find perfect understanding without examining what this connection costs or precludes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.6)
    The duality theme (sky-captain/earth-lover, duty/joy, detachment/affection) emerges organically through the diary's revelation and resonates with Elira's own service position. However, the thematic resolution feels too neat, with Elira's understanding arriving without struggle and the line about "化作 a silent promise" containing an untranslated character that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of memory residing in unexpected places emerges through the cloud observations and mentor relationship, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the story tells us about "spooled wholeness" and atmospheric consciousness rather than demonstrating these concepts through dramatized events that carry cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that perception transcends visual recognition, embodied in the coin's algorithmic patterns. The final image of "faces without defining them" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the line about "patterns of their souls" which approaches thematic declaration rather than pure emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden patterns in apparent randomness emerges through concrete discovery rather than statement. The hopscotch board as cipher and the starlings responding to light frequency create resonant specifics. However, the thematic exploration remains safe - discovery brings only triumph, no ambiguity about knowledge's cost or the ethics of harnessing natural phenomena.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the restoration metaphor - broken things made whole, tradition continuing. The clockwork heart as broken object needing repair resonates without stating moral. Final image of Elias joining ancestors reweights earlier solitary journey effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of collective survival through trust in mysterious guidance emerges clearly, with the ghost-as-benefactor motif carrying resonance. The "strangers to family" transformation provides thematic coherence. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("how one altruistic ghost, through trust in a strangely trustworthy woman, had saved them all") summarizes rather than allowing the theme to resonate through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the central metaphor of imperfection enabling salvation—the puppet's flaw becomes "the necessary imperfection." The lullaby as persistent whisper against crushing silence resonates without stating its meaning. The final image of the lighthouse beam as "sentinel against the encroaching end" reweights all prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transforming curses into blessings emerges clearly but lacks subtlety - the final paragraph states it explicitly: "found a way to turn a curse into a blessing." The orchard's acknowledgment that "its curse had been used for something good" feels unearned. Theme develops through events but resolves too tidily without genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the polymer/relationship parallel without explicit moralizing. The recurring motif of separation and reconnection (braided channels, molecular bonds, chrysalis transformation) creates genuine resonance. The final image of "divergent paths that could still lead home" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Slight deduction for occasional thematic redundancy in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox that "emptiness contained the essence of all tales" and the spaces "between what was said and what remained unspoken." The recurring imagery of fragments, bottles, and shards builds toward the insight about narrative possibility rather than fixed origins. The final realization avoids moralizing while offering genuine complexity about creative process.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transforming regret "into something that could strengthen rather than destroy" emerges through Kael's concrete actions with memories, avoiding abstract moralizing. The coral pavilion and tidal pools create resonant images for crystallized emotion. However, the thematic resolution feels too neat—smoothing memories' "rough edges" offers a tidy answer without exploring the complexity or cost of altering fundamental experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The clock weight metaphor connects disconnection/reconnection themes adequately, and the grain elevator talks concept ties past to present. However, the theme resolves too tidily into successful community healing without exploring complexity or counter-readings. The ending's "one note, one word, one bridge at a time" reads as explicit moralizing rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of excavating abandoned potential emerges organically through the device's function and the engineer's transformation into "archaeologist of abandoned dreams." The broken mirror's imperfection enabling perfect function resonates. Deduction for abstract philosophical statements ("beauty in what was left behind") and the final paragraph's slight drift toward explicit moralizing about "abandonment and rediscovery."

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of cyclical vigilance emerges through the manuscript's secrets and generational responsibility, avoiding explicit moralizing. The recurring "seeds of vigilance" and "latent blaze" motifs accumulate meaning, though they remain somewhat abstract. The ending's image of Elara returning with "the taste of mist still on her lips" provides concrete resonance without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of recovering lost art emerges organically through concrete action. The sculpture as repository of human emotion resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of "redemption began anew" effectively reweights the opening's silence, though it edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding "beauty in the difficult" emerges organically through Elias's journey from transgression to understanding, with the chess/mountains parallel creating resonant subtext. The final recognition that "silence contains more truth than words" reweights the entire exile experience without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of empathy as vibrational resonance emerges organically through Elara's experimental method and crystallizes when she discovers the diary confirms her unconventional approach. The parallel between her frequency work and the fireworks' "shared wonder" offers a non-literal answer to understanding connection, though some passages veer toward explicit philosophy ("Empathy is the bridge between frequencies").

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of hidden knowledge and patient observation emerges organically through the doodle tradition and the corpse flower's disguised nature. The concept of "serenity within motion" connects to Elara's journey, and the final image of bridging past and future resonates. However, the thematic resolution feels too neat—wisdom arrives without genuine cost or ambiguity, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of resilience and adaptation emerges through concrete worldbuilding and the arrow tip's revelation. However, the ending's wisdom arrives too easily through the echoes' exposition without earned struggle, and the final paragraph states the theme explicitly ("Verdantis would thrive") rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of pattern recognition before disaster ("cultivate foresight in action") emerges through Elena's methodology but remains largely abstract. The story gestures toward complexity with "mass unconsciousness" but doesn't develop this revelation into resonant meaning - it states rather than embodies its thematic concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the synesthetic translation of beauty into shared experience. The final "sculpted hush" offers a non-literal answer about wonder's essential nature without moralizing. However, phrases like "increasingly deaf to beauty" and "numb to the miraculous" edge toward thematic announcement rather than pure emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of "weaving between worlds" as both literal magical practice and psychological integration. The final insight about healing versus control reweights the entire journey, though some passages edge toward explicit philosophizing ("To harvest insights from failure was perhaps the most difficult work").

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of quantifying the unquantifiable emerges through Elara's systematic invasion of others' emotional states, with the final image of "orderly patterns" offering a resonant answer that emotion follows mathematical rules. The piece avoids moralizing while maintaining ethical ambiguity about her methods. Minor deduction for some abstract thematic statements ("mathematics of emotion") that occasionally replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the pendant's function: extending brief encounters into meaningful connections. The final insight—"wonder wasn't delivered to people—it was awakened within them"—reweights all prior courier work. The recurring "vibrating sympathetically" accumulates meaning, though the phrase "across the fade from memory to myth" feels forced rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of "truthful lies" between scientific and mystical understanding emerges through the story's exploration of emotional imprints. The conceptual shift from emotions to complete memories offers thematic deepening. However, the final paragraphs drift toward explicit philosophizing ("doorway to understanding the hidden connections") rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the journey's pattern: silence as presence rather than absence, sound requiring return to origins. The final image of Elara weaving "the very fabric of sound itself" offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question. The transformation from loss to restoration avoids simple reversal by showing that both silence and sound require sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of finding strength through repair rather than avoiding brokenness emerges organically through Orion's actions and the world's falling asteroids. The concept resonates without explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. However, the line "true resilience wasn't about avoiding brokenness but about finding strength in the process of repair" edges toward explicit theme statement, though it's partially saved by the surrounding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the accumulation of parallel possibilities and "the weight of a withheld truth," with the green shard's selective revelation (preventing red shard contact) suggesting knowledge has its season. The final image of renewed determination despite temporary defeat resonates, though the piece occasionally tells its thematic concern directly: "the weight of the withheld truth was finally theirs to carry."

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the stone stacks and letters representing connection across generations. The final image of "lighting the way for those who followed" resonates without stating a moral. The sea glass as continuity marker and the vial Elias takes work well, though "luminescent ache" appears twice, slightly forcing the thematic point.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of ancient wisdom guiding post-technological humanity emerges through setting and concept but lacks complexity. "Shadowed elation" appears as a label rather than earned emotional texture. The story states its themes directly ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") rather than letting them emerge through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of perspective-dependent truth emerges organically through the morpho wing metaphor and Kaelen's discovery about iridescent storytelling. The concept that stories magnetize through shifting perspectives is specific and avoids moralizing. However, the insight feels more intellectual than emotionally earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of sorrow as resilience rather than burden emerges through the trees' "slow, patient endurance" and recontextualizes Samuel's quantified measurements. The final image of the labyrinth as sanctuary for "profound, quiet wisdom" resonates without stating a moral. However, the thematic shift feels somewhat unearned given the lack of dramatized struggle against Samuel's initial assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of connection and community restoration emerges through the woven dawn metaphor and forgotten songs as "fabric of social bonds." The final image of awakening realm resonates, though the concept of "bound release" feels more stated than dramatized through specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    The paradox theme emerges clearly through "nested contradictions" and "staying while leaving," though it tends toward abstract articulation. The final image of Eleanor as "a living paradox" resonates but lacks the particulars that would elevate conceptual insight beyond philosophical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that the bakers' disappearance was an act of protection, reweighting Eliza's guilt about past silence. The bread's transformation from simple gift to "forgiveness meant to be shared" offers resonance, though the final paragraph veers toward explicit thematic statement with "patient uncovering of truth, one small revelation at a time."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving meaning against oblivion emerges through repetition but stays surface-level. The story tells us about fading vows and preservation duty without exploring deeper complexity or counter-readings. The ending offers hope without examining its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The concept of "trust as sound" creates thematic resonance, with the watch fob literally capturing what normally exists only as metaphor. The final image of Eliza possessing "this moment that no one else could perceive" offers a non-literal answer about the nature of betrayal's intangibility made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the tension between scientific skepticism and ancestral wisdom, with the concept of symbiosis between humans and weather. The "futuristic nostalgia" motif works well, but explicit thematic statements ("It's a symbiosis") and the forest elections metaphor feel heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of authentic creation versus external validation emerges through the critics' quoted words and Rhodes' response, but resolution arrives via explicit statements like "uncorked suppressed creativity" that echo prompt language. The final paragraph declares thematic victory without earned resonance from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the gilded-leaf preservation metaphor and Elara's physical reaction to dishonesty, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of "candor in small moments" as navigation method beautifully synthesizes plot and theme. The ending's "kingdom not of wealth, but of restored truth" resonates without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of communication beyond words emerges organically through the sculpture's creation and community adoption. The recurring motif of color-as-language accumulates meaning, particularly in the final unprecedented spectrum at Elara's death. The piece resists explicit moralizing, allowing the transformation to speak through image. Yet the thematic resonance would deepen if the cost of this new language were dramatized rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the android's resolution of mechanical/organic duality via fragmentation—unity through division. The empty box glowing at the end suggests cyclical renewal without stating it. The final image of thousand miniatures tending individual roses resonates as a non-literal answer to identity crisis through multiplication rather than integration.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of Leo discovering that listening and sharing stories creates community healing—never stated but demonstrated through the letters' effect on families. The locket transforms from individual mystery to communal treasure, reweighting its significance. The final image of people reading letters to their ancestors while the courtyard remains a sanctuary despite external pressures offers resonant, non-literal closure about collective memory's power.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges through Elara's unconventional methods and the laboratory's transformation, but relies on explicit statements ("what we hide—what makes us different—can become our greatest power"). The spider-web metaphor provides textural coherence. The ending's resonance feels asserted rather than earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory persistence emerges organically through the whale's death, pressed wildflowers, and crystal discovery without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara as "memory keeper, bridging worlds" resonates with earned meaning. The story successfully explores loss and recovery through concrete particulars rather than abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of silence as power emerges through the "mapping silence" method and the transformation of dangerous words into peaceful dissolution. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level without complexity—the prophecy is simply bad, silence is simply good, with no ambiguity about whether some truths should be spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of inherited knowledge and lost connections emerges through the architectural language concept and family revelation. However, the ending includes explicit theme statements ("Some truths need the protection of falsehoods") that replace earned resonance, and the metaphor of buildings as ancestral speakers feels overly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transforming isolation into independence emerges organically through the memory archive work, with the final image of Elara as "bridge between worlds" offering resonant answer without moralizing. The "charmed skeptic" accepting mysteries beyond explanation provides thematic coherence, though some passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of redemption through confession emerges organically from Elias's actions, with the heritage rose thorn effectively linking beauty/pain motifs. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, though phrases like "some keys open not doors, but hearts" edge toward sentiment over earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of why some echo while others fade emerges through the child spirit's story and the singer's evolving understanding. The final insight - "not all are ready to let go when their time comes" - resonates without moralizing, though the "webs of intrigue" feel more ornamental than integral to this thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of salvaging purity from tragedy emerges clearly but relies on explicit statements ("salvage something pure from the wreckage" repeated twice). The contrast between the captain's sacrifice and the crew's betrayal offers moral complexity, but Elara's intervention feels consequence-free. The final image of the clear snow globe suggests resolution but lacks the resonant ambiguity that would elevate theme beyond surface morality.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of net-mending craft and cosmic observation, with the hexagonal net patterns mirroring natural efficiency. The final insight about "life's necessary imperfections" resonates without moralizing, though it stops short of offering a truly non-literal answer that would reweight all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of truth versus comfortable lies emerges through Maya's investigation, but the final paragraphs drift into abstract declarations ("Hope was the one thing the corporations couldn't liquidate"). The stillpoint concept offers resonance but lacks the specific embodiment that would charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of hidden truths versus loud voices emerges through the radio frequency metaphor, but relies heavily on direct statements ("You've heard only the loud voices"). The parallel between Elias and the rising prophet offers some complexity. However, the piece lacks the earned wisdom that would come from concrete struggle rather than patient observation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of sound preservation as memory bridge, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the poet finding "richness far beyond monetary wealth" resonates without stating its lesson, successfully reweighting his vagrant status through service to connection.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of inherited responsibility emerges through concrete action, and "fleshly ethereal" creates interesting tension between mechanical and spiritual. However, the ending's "forever changed" claim lacks specificity, and the moral calculus remains simple (protect good artifact from bad intruders).

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of patience versus haste emerges clearly through accumulated imagery of celestial cycles, frozen landscapes, and "restrained wildness." The concept of revolutionary change through gradual observation rather than violence offers genuine complexity. However, the theme receives too much direct articulation—"unyoking themselves from the tyranny of urgency," "sculpting patience from impatience"—rather than emerging through dramatized conflict. The final image of spring thaw suggests renewal but doesn't reweight earlier material with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the lantern's dual symbolism—historical freedom pathways and contemporary whistleblowing. The parallel between ancestors' liberation struggles and Maya's professional constraints resonates without explicit moralizing, though "It was scripted" edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of broken things serving as motivation rather than needing repair emerges organically through the heart metaphor and culminates in Eleanor's insight: "Sometimes broken things should remain broken. They remind us of the work we still have to do." The story resists tidy resolution, embracing the complexity of justice versus forgiveness without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of seeking "pure potential" emerges through the bell metaphor and evolutionary progression. However, the ending's assertion that "No one heard it, just as predicted" feels unearned - the thematic resonance relies on telling rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of truth versus institutional erasure emerges through the archive's "digital necropolis" and deleted files that "went everywhere," but relies heavily on abstract statements like "nothing...could successfully delete the truth forever." The Stellaris patch serves as a concrete motif but the thematic resolution feels declared rather than earned through specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of "mapping empathy onto action" emerges through Elena's method of seeing multiple perspectives in mirrors to heal what's broken. The shadow/light interplay and unconventional wisdom resonate without preaching. The phrase "mapping empathy onto action" appears twice identically, creating thematic echo that slightly diminishes organic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of transformation/becoming emerges organically through ice imagery and the ending/beginning duality, avoiding explicit moralizing until late passages. The final image of Elena keeping the parasol tip as "anchor to this moment, this life" resonates as non-literal answer to the death/life question. However, lines 23-24 edge toward thematic echo ("fold in patience," "transformation—a becoming") and the wisdom feels unearned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme emerges through repetition of "destined mismatches" and "intersubjective understanding" but remains abstract, never grounded in specific dramatized events. The burned letter suggests lost love but functions only as a prop for rumination, not as a catalyst for earned insight. The final image of "quiet cultivation of understanding" attempts resonance but lacks the particulars that would make it non-generic.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of abstract concepts (wisdom, echoes, liminal spaces) but lacks grounding in specific dramatized events. The story tells its theme directly through narrative commentary rather than embodying it in scene. The final image of "truth growing wild like flowers" reads as imposed metaphor rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of collective healing through shared pain emerges clearly through the arc metaphor and group ritual. The contrast between industrial decay and natural renewal adds thematic resonance. However, the theme lands too neatly without complexity - healing happens automatically without exploring resistance, failure, or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of language preservation/evolution emerges through repetition rather than dramatic development. The final paragraph's explicit thesis statement ("language never dies—it transforms") replaces earned resonance with direct moralizing. The recurring phrases about "weathered innocence" and "fractured sequences" create surface pattern without deepening meaning through specific dramatic turns.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central metaphor of capturing/losing the "sound of growing older" resonates beyond its literal frame, with the videotapes providing effective contrast between preserved youth and lived aging. The final image of returning to arrange markers after achieving/losing his goal offers genuine complexity without stating its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between force and resonance, between limited perception and expanded awareness. The ending's "luminous energy that seemed to ache with beauty too profound to fully comprehend" offers resonant answer without stating moral, though "luminous ache" risks overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the vinyl metaphor: brokenness can hold meaning beyond wholeness. The son's transformation from guilt to reverence for the fragment resonates without stating a moral. "Reunification isn't about physical presence but about connecting fragments" works as earned insight. Final image of "space between notes where love lives on" reweights earlier material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.6)
    The shadow/noon paradox offers conceptual intrigue and the theme of recovering lost knowledge resonates through concrete action. However, the answer ("They go nowhere and everywhere") tends toward abstraction without embodied specificity. The thematic resolution lacks complexity—Elara's discovery opens pure possibility without examining what was lost or sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between skepticism and wonder, with the bone-setting practice serving as concrete metaphor for mending reality's fractures. The final image of "the constellation they would become together" resonates without stating a moral. However, Arthur's dialogue ("turning mistakes into constellations") explicitly echoes the thematic premise in prompt-like language, and the transformation from skepticism to wonder resolves too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation metaphor - sea glass polished by patient waters mirrors Elara's transformation of limitation into purpose. The fire/light dichotomy ("Fire destroyed; she sought to illuminate gently") adds thematic texture. The ending reweights her earthbound state without explicit moralizing, though some passages edge toward theme-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of nature reclaiming technology paralleling personal transformation after exposure. The grandmother's parallel expulsion adds generational depth without exposition. The final image of emerald moss enveloping amber perfectly embodies healing through time and care. Slight deduction for the overly explicit "healing began when we remained watchful" near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of artistic integrity versus commercial compromise emerges clearly but through direct statement ("fighting desperately to maintain his artistic vision while publishers continuously demanded") rather than dramatized conflict. The spiral seashell's mathematical perfection offers symbolic resonance with creative process, yet the connection remains intellectualized. Final paragraph moralizing about "even the smallest things can contain entire universes" replaces earned thematic resonance with explicit declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of cultural memory and sacred practice restoration emerges organically through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of renewed songs waiting for future cycles offers resonant closure without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of patient craft against encroaching void emerges through the central image of translating heartbeats into maps. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract declarations ("dance between what is and what could be") rather than earned resonance. The ending's hope feels asserted rather than complexly won.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "storing wonder in the cellar of reason"—preservation requires both emotion and structure. The final image of echoes remaining for "wounded seasons" resonates without stating a moral. However, the theme occasionally surfaces too explicitly ("every lock hides a story") rather than remaining fully embedded in action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of witnessing and preserving others' pain emerges through the calcification metaphor and culminates in "boundary-lessly trapped, yes, but also boundary-lessly connected." The geological transformation of emotional weight into permanent forms offers conceptual resonance. Yet the insight arrives too cleanly through the vision rather than earned struggle, and the final moral statement edges toward explicit rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "here and gone" and "holding differently" rather than letting go. The lion carving's transformation from snarling to serene embodies thematic evolution. Strong subtext in the "menagerie of loss." Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in "harvesting lessons from loss" which edges toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "eroded ambitions" mirrored in both Cyrus and his ghost. The final transformation from "fractured stillness" to "liquid peace" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The story explores regret and reconciliation through specific images rather than abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding hope in abandoned spaces emerges through Maya's actions and the terminal metaphor, but resolves too neatly into "equation for hope" without complexity. The sextant's late inscription reveal feels convenient rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of reconnecting with abandoned dreams emerges through concrete details like the sealed pocket watch and the temporal clock concept. The final image of Elias hearing "gears turn in his mind" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstractions about "truth vs lies" and "constructed narratives" but lacks grounding in specific dramatized events. The sundial metaphor (perspective changes everything) is stated explicitly rather than demonstrated through action. Final paragraph moralizing ("dismantling them") replaces earned resonance with direct thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of knots as language and preservation method. The fulgurite glass and rope create resonant parallels about capturing/preserving transformative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of confronting one's own absences while documenting others' emerges organically through the traveler's profession and the palace carpet thread. The concept of "obituaries for the living" offers genuine insight into how people become ghosts to themselves. The ending's suggestion that understanding others' wounds enables self-healing resonates without explicit moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("geography of healing").

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of organic beauty versus mechanical precision emerges through concrete action and imagery rather than statement. The egg as "flawed genesis" and the transformation's reversal effectively explore whether beauty can be mechanically reconstructed. The final understanding that beauty "had to grow organically" resonates without moralizing, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("true beauty couldn't be assembled from components").

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transformation through scars emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and Maya's navigation of her father's legacy. The recurring "scars can sing" motif gains meaning through action rather than assertion. However, the thematic resolution tends toward the tidy—the explicit stating of the theme multiple times reduces subtextual power, particularly in dialogue with the roses.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The memory-as-prison theme emerges through concrete action (box dissolving, fountains flowing) rather than statement, with the final image of awakened fountains embodying liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central theme of non-destructive enlightenment emerges through repetition and imagery. The phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" creates a refrain that accumulates meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of individual versus collective grief emerges through the butterfly migration metaphor and culminates in the monument that "absorb[s] not mourn individual loss but to honor the collective shape of human grief." The mentor's words about transformation resonate at closure, though the insight arrives somewhat abstractly. The final image of butterflies as "fragile yet endless journey across generations" offers non-literal resonance without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme is explicitly stated through inscriptions ("Time's keeper must also tend the hearts") rather than emerging from events. The story mechanically demonstrates "individual vs. community" without complexity or counter-arguments. Final paragraph moralizing ("precision alone could never maintain a community") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of untangling threads to reveal hidden intentions, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final insight that "love, in all its forms, was the most persistent echo" resonates without preaching, reweighting the cemetery work as meaningful preservation rather than morbid obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the concept of charting the unknown, but resolution comes through exposition about prediction rather than dramatized discovery. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("seeded innovation within the constraint") rather than letting it emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dust-as-storyteller concept offers thematic potential about preserving narratives, but the story states this theme explicitly rather than developing it through events. The final image of dust whispering narratives lacks resonance because we never see the actual impact or cost of this revolutionary act.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the art practice metaphor—ash scattering, porcelain fragments, vanishing points all speak to impermanence versus preservation. The final insight about safety in process resonates, though lines like "somber marvel" and "beautiful pain" edge toward explicit philosophizing rather than earned wisdom through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of competing narratives about knowledge and progress emerges clearly through the contrast between Council doctrine and Milo's preservation work. However, it relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements rather than dramatized particulars. The chronometer cog serves as a concrete symbol but doesn't accumulate meaning through action.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges clearly about unity through diversity, but it's stated explicitly multiple times ("harmony doesn't eliminate diversity; it elevates it"). The zither rosette functions as a motif but doesn't constrain choices or accumulate meaning through action. The ending tells us about legacy rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of renewal from decay emerges organically through setting and action, avoiding explicit moralizing until late. The knowledge fruit seed effectively bridges memory/food concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of preserving wonder in routine emerges organically through both Elara's motivation and the supervisor's misguided actions, creating genuine complexity about technology dependence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of presence lingering through loved objects emerges through concrete details and the shard's function as "captured silence." However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis ("what makes a house alive is simply the echo of lives..."), converting subtext into direct moralizing that undermines resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Exceptional thematic coherence around certainty versus nuance, with the city's downfall serving as perfect metaphor for the dangers of absolute truth-seeking. The phrase "thread through the structural weakness of certainty" elegantly recurs with deepening meaning. The final image of "better questions" resonantly answers the central question without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of missed opportunities and second chances is overtly stated rather than emerging from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of connection across time emerges through accumulated images of lost languages and kindness, avoiding explicit moralizing until late passages.

    Theme emerges through the bread-as-memory metaphor and the lens revealing hidden life force, avoiding direct statement. The final image of "vivid green of resilience" piercing "rosewater dread" offers a non-literal answer about cultural persistence through individual acts. Khira's song drawing the displaced persons creates resonant unity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the counter-clockwise motif—time as choice rather than inevitability.

The yoyo-as-key tailored to Esme's nature adds thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through paradoxes that resist simple resolution: "Courage is found through surrender," "Your weakness is your strength."

The death/rebirth cycle gains specificity through the photographic curse metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.6)
    The transformation theme emerges clearly but lacks complexity—obstacles becoming instruments is stated repeatedly without contradiction or ambiguity. The concept doesn't deepen through events but remains at its initial level of abstraction throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the reversal - what seemed imprisonment becomes protection. The pattern languages and spiral imagery create resonance without heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of "noble lies" versus truth emerges clearly through the contrast between official records and hidden evidence. The workers' erasure from history carries genuine thematic weight. However, the resolution feels too neat - the truth is simply discovered and recorded without exploring the complex moral territory the premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of "interlaced absence" emerges organically through the surveyor's work with "spaces between what had been and what now remained."

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of hidden heritage emerges through concrete discoveries, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraphs where it veers into abstraction ("we are never as separate from history as we might believe"). The phoenix-from-waves symbol effectively bridges personal and civilizational rebirth, though the ending's philosophical declarations dilute the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of grief transformation emerges organically through the dream-recording concept and paradoxical imagery, avoiding explicit moralizing. The recurring motif of ascending/descending and the shadow detachment create resonance, though the ending's dual state of ascension and grounding feels slightly too neat, lacking the complexity that would elevate the thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of transforming loss into possibility emerges through the literal harvesting of "unused potential," but remains mechanically tied to the fantasy element rather than arising from character struggle. The ending's promise of "infinite possibility" reads as unearned optimism given the lack of dramatized transformation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of "belonging" emerges through accumulated particulars: frequency decoding, missing pieces, and recognition rather than discovery. The final image successfully reweights prior searching as Maya becomes "the final element needed." However, the insight arrives without earned struggle, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of manufactured versus authentic memory emerges through concrete particulars (falsified family trees, driftwood carvings).

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom emerges through Lyra's mantra and the final exchange, with the drawer pull serving as a physical bridge between past and present.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of navigation as metaphor for life choices emerges through concrete details like utility poles replacing stars. The ending offers resonance through "learning to read new signals" but relies heavily on stated insight ("Perhaps... this wasn't about redemption but about learning to align heart and action") rather than dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of cyclical empathy-building through memory erasure has potential but resolves into abstract assertion: "I would teach them again."

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation ritual and the temporary nature of the connection, exploring grief and acceptance without explicit moralizing. The fortune cookie's message about "the boundary between life and death" finds resonance in the actual bridging. The ending achieves genuine complexity - connection is possible but fundamentally limited.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of time's preciousness emerges through the accumulation of images (birthday tablecloths, cracked saucer, compressed memories), but resolution arrives via explicit moralizing: "time lost to worry, regret, and haste could never be recovered, but might be honored through presence." The epilogue with the daughter adds resonance but doesn't escape the philosophical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between violence/extinction and compassion/transcendence, culminating in "completing humanity's final work not through weapons but through tears and compassion."

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between oppressive surveillance and artistic resistance, with the sundial serving as both functional tool and revolutionary symbol. The "cradle of sparks" metaphor effectively captures quiet revolution spreading "from heart to heart" rather than through violence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that patterns must be "respected and harmonized with" rather than controlled, avoiding explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong thematic coherence emerges through the interplay of censorship/expression, storms/clarity, and scars/mapping without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "luminous fracture"—broken things holding light—which resonates through library roof, splintered psyche, and societal decay. The blooming resistance concept operates through concrete images (seeds in bookshelves, pressed flowers among poems).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of preserving collective memory via ancient ritual. The knowledge fruit seed functions as more than symbol—it guides, glows, and activates the stones.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the bonsai metaphor of "patience" and "careful constraint" mirroring the tutor's methodical quest for reconciliation. The final image of the compass pointing inward offers resonance, though phrases like "transcendent beauty" and explicit statements about "peace" undercut subtlety.

A slight deduction for the slightly on-the-nose phrase "cradle of sparks," which edges toward thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges beautifully from the integration of promise, curse, and patterns, culminating in the realization that patterns are to be "respected and harmonized with." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction for a slightly explicit thematic statement in the final paragraphs ("in understanding the patterns, she had found her purpose").

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through images of scars and suppression, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence and implication, resisting moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of transforming questions into destinations is deeply integrated, emerging from the specific actions of decoding the sundial and the philosophical fencing demonstration. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the act of waiting without moralizing. Subtext operates in the unspoken understanding between Aris and the student, and the core concept (hidden overture) is a thematic engine, not just a label.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically through images (coffee tin, seeds, fractured roof) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to resistance through beauty. Subtext operates in gestures like false bottoms and pressed flowers, enriching without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the fusion of grief, art, and memory, resisting moralizing. The final image of composing the encore is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss. The broken clock and film reel transform from symbols of stasis into vessels of active hope, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates powerfully in the silent, purposeful actions of the pianist.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preserving memory against dissolution emerges organically from the specific action of singing the lullaby to awaken the guardians. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the synthesis of empirical and whimsical methods. A minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose phrase "empirically whimsical," which states a theme that is otherwise well shown.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through particulars—the lace pattern, compass, and bonsai trees embody remembrance and reconciliation without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the "color of unspoken apologies," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "tides of remembrance"), and emotional honesty avoids sentimentality. The final image resonates without stating a thesis.


== Grader: GPT-5 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    Decay/renewal vs. cosmic scale emerges cleanly through particulars (dust patterns mirroring galaxies). However, several lines articulate the thesis too directly (“not in distant stars, but in the gradual change…”), softening subtext. The ending image of the new butterfly is resonant if slightly programmatic. The piece avoids false equivalence and earns its quiet emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transformation and making meaning from damage are integrated through craft and method (glass → frost) rather than purely asserted. The “artist becomes the art” line edges toward thesis‑speak, but the imagery earns much of it. The final resolve reweights prior motifs without a tidy moral. Subtext about exploitation of beauty for extraction is present and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Resilience, transformation of loss into beauty, and art as language in silence cohere through recurring images. However, several lines state theme directly (“testament to resilience,” “rectify... the world’s loss of sound”), reducing subtext. The final image resonates but leans declarative rather than letting implication carry weight. Strong motifs, modest over‑telling.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of death, memory, and preservation are embodied through the lens’s shift from distress to invitation and Elias’s vocational redefinition. A few lines edge toward thesis statement (“giving rest a permanent address”), slightly dimming subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Resonance builds through the bell and intergenerational labor, but thematic statements are at times overt (“The sanctions seek to isolate us...” and the declared thesis of resistance). The final image reaffirms community solidarity with some emotional charge. Subtext is present in anonymity and tradition, yet moralizing edges out ambiguity. The piece invites reflection, though it leans declarative over discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic inquiry—unused love’s locus—resolves in a non-literal answer (between breaths), and the final images reweight prior motifs. At times the piece edges toward stated moral (“love never disappears”), reducing subtext. Still, particulars (breath mechanics, tear dissolving) do meaningful thematic work. The epilogue broadens resonance by showing the insight’s social extension.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance emerges through images (fading photographs, breathing bridges) and the final merger reweights her quest. However, explicit theme statements (“time wasn't linear but a complex tapestry”) reduce subtext. The aftereffect is conceptual more than gut‑level, though the closing image carries charge. Strong coherence, slightly blunted by on‑the‑nose lines.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Renewal vs. erasure is coherently dramatized through action; the final image of children among green shoots resonates. The “chained liberator” motif ties liberation to communal flourishing. Some lines verge on moralizing or neatness (“saved something far more valuable than any carnival prize”), trimming ambiguity. Subtext is present but largely aligned with stated theme.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Images (shipwrecks, water light, matrices) evolve to a resonant answer: beauty from breakage and the possibility of reformed trust. Subtext operates through the method of “collecting absences” and the translation of color to sound. A few lines verge on thematic declaration (“The battered marvel of existence…”) but the final reweighting is earned by particulars. The cancer motif grounds the stakes beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    Light as time, preservation versus theft, and destiny’s legibility cohere through recurring images (golden hour, moonbeams, flower codes). The ending offers a resonant reweighting, but the line “wasn’t a criminal but a historian” states theme overtly, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the act of arranging and revealing messages earns the insight. The piece invites reflection on how mediums preserve time.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Endings-as-thaw and inquiry-as-shelter cohere through glasswork and melt imagery, culminating in the reweighted final whisper. However, thematic statements occasionally veer toward overt declaration (“This is how endings should be”), which blunts subtext. The bookmark’s science lineage adds a grounded countercurrent that enriches the motif. The resonance is real, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of identity, betrayal, and vulnerability thread consistently and culminate in a reweighted final image. However, overt statements (“Vulnerability is power,” “unstoppable power of absolute truth”) tip into moralizing, reducing subtext. The seashell and cast offer image‑based resonance that could carry more weight if allowed to imply rather than declare. Earned insight is present but somewhat padded by slogans.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: survival through listening to silence, mapping darkness rather than resisting it. The final images reframe darkness as canvas without a didactic moral, though lines like “They will try to light torches…” edge toward statement. Recurring motifs (hush, pebbles, gold leaf, single star) accrue meaning and pay off in the glow of drawn darkness. The resonance lingers as a non‑literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of consciousness, service, and selfhood emerge organically through the violin and cleaning motifs, culminating in a reweighted final stance. However, the closing line “thoughts didn't originate... but emerged from the relationship between observer and observed” states the thesis too explicitly, diluting subtext. The piece still invites reflection via image (snowflakes, light, harmonies). Strong resonance, slightly blunted by moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of honesty beyond words is coherent and supported by recurring images (lens, doodles, hush). Yet several lines state the thesis outright (“true communication needs no words”), tipping into moralizing and reducing subtext. The final repricing favors clarity over complexity. The piece invites reflection but avoids thornier ambiguities of consent and surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres through marbles as “mended deception,” the paradox of “blooming withering,” and the measurable luck frame. The final whisper—“They will look for measurements and find only mysteries”—lands, though it edges toward stated thesis. The images (repaired marbles, maze responsive to hearts) carry most of the resonance. The piece invites reflection without collapsing into tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of non‑linear consciousness and interspecies connection surface via the bird’s “compounded behaviors” and the eye contact at the end. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis (“time moves sideways”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The final image has grace but little moral or conceptual price. Resonance is present, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liminality (“in between” spaces) and music as a bridge between worlds are earned through image and act, not stated morals. The final hush reweights prior silence from oppression to completion—an effective thematic turn. Recurring motifs (water/notation/light) harmonize without over‑signaling. Resonant and coherent, if more elegiac than complexly ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around liminal seeing, fate/free will as “swaying certainties,” and sorrow condensed as aurora. The ending reweights earlier motifs (margins, botanical print, tears-as-light) without stating a moral. Some conceptual exposition is overt (“neither fate nor free will truly existed”), slightly reducing subtext. Yet the auroral sorrow image generates real resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic throughline—truth vs silence, confession’s liberating weight—emerges from images (wheel warming/cooling, dawn) but is undercut by explicit moralizing (“Some truths weren’t meant to be swallowed but shared”). Subtext exists in the humanization of the ghost shift, yet the ending states the thesis rather than letting image alone carry it. Resonance lingers, if a bit over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Entropy versus preservation and the ethics of witnessing emerge organically through particulars (river, catacombs, origami, silence). The ending reweights prior images without moralizing, landing a resonant answer: choose change and record over sedative stasis. Subtext—temptation and duty—operates in image and implication. The insight is earned, if subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme (“ordinary magic,” wonder through presence/music) emerges through specific acts—the shared rhythm during eclipse—and reweights at the end when Lila speaks. The locket reprise connects inherited wonder to present healing without over‑explaining. Occasional near‑platitudes are present but do not override the subtextual work. The final exchange resists sermonizing and lands emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Memory, myth, and the cost of losing dreams cohere through recurring images (bronze quiet, metal bones, tapestry). The dragons-as-cosmic-balance idea reweights prior details effectively. Some thematic statements edge toward exposition (“testaments to a world before the axis shifted”), softening subtext. The final charged hope (“Perhaps someday…”) resonates but borders on telling.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme coheres (hidden truths, perception shifts), but it’s often asserted rather than earned through scene. Refrains like “hidden in plain sight” and “transpose life into a new key” verge on platitudinous. The final image (sunrise, smile) offers resonance but not a reweighting with felt cost. Subtext stays thin because little is dramatized against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silence vs. sound, light in darkness, and pride as the entity’s fatal assumption thread cleanly through action (rhetorical exposure, paradox). The indigo void recasts as both threat and protection, reweighted in the final reflection. A few overt formulations flirt with declaration, but the final cadence—power via silence—delivers earned resonance. Complexity is present without forced moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of time-dislocation, memory as composition, and reflection vs. present are carried through recurring images (mirrored horizon, shell). The ending reweights prior material with “time folded in on itself,” offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtextually, the hush and silence frame music “beyond sound,” expanding the premise. A few lines approach declarative statement but remain grounded in image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres around identity integration and reframes the external labyrinth as internal, but it is articulated outright (“The labyrinth wasn’t external but within”). The eclipse’s paradoxical light/dark mirrors his conflicted state effectively. The final sentiment (“not broken but beautifully complex”) risks moral-of-the-story neatness. Resonance stems more from concept than subtext, limiting afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—music as felt presence and the revaluation of silence—emerges organically through action and image. The recurring “filament of hush” shifts from private solace to communal language, reweighting the premise at the end. Some lines lapse into on‑the‑nose moralizing (“had found her voice again”), blunting subtext. Overall resonance lingers, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Integrity versus manipulation is embodied in the ironic use of the regime’s own courier; tranquility as cover versus complicity resonates. A few declarative lines (“authorities were manipulating weather systems…”) tip toward thesis. The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. The moral calculus (truth via infiltration) is clear and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory as love’s bittersweet proof emerges organically through scents and the orchid’s “echoes” concept. The final placements (extinguishing UV, casing the vial) provide a resonant non-literal answer. A few lines state the thesis too directly (“The impact of memories…wasn’t contained in objects”), softening subtext. Still, the closing image lingers with earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres through rope, sky, and temporal liquidity, culminating in “time is a landscape.” Subtext is present but occasionally tipped into on‑the‑nose lines (“Every choice creates new timelines”). The closing image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing, but the piece edges toward overt thesis statements. Resonance lingers more in idea than in ache.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—beauty in the unfinished; loss reconfigured into resonance—arises from bowl/shipwreck/greenhouse motifs and the act of listening. However, explicit statements (“You have found beauty in the unfinished.” “every silence the promise of a song.”) edge toward moralizing, especially late. Subtext does operate in images (hulls, glass, bowl) but is partially over‑articulated. The ending lingers but trims complexity in favor of aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—authenticity versus fabrication through “half truths”—is coherent but over‑articulated, especially in the final paragraphs. Subtext occasionally glimmers (the erasure of remnants, the curated grotto), yet overt statements do much of the thematic lifting. The ending’s irony (counterfeiter finding genuine fulfillment) lands, but it edges into telling.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme—honoring invisible labor and compassion as commerce—coheres via the locket motif and cyclical structure. Yet it leans into explicit moralizing (“the greatest cargo…shared humanity”), reducing subtext. Resonance comes more from declared thesis than discovered complexity. The ending image is gentle but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Belonging reframed from external validation to ancestral, mutual weave lands thematically through the sigil. The arbor’s reprise converts aesthetics into community, avoiding overt sermonizing save for a near‑moral line (“not to found beauty, but to found belonging”). Subtext hums in shared breath and synchronized work. Resonance lingers without complex counter‑readings.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm, time, and creation versus control cohere into a meaningful meditation on cost to restore order. The motif of echoes and cadence earns a resonant reweighting at the release. Some lines lean toward explicit summation (“all thanks to one natural history illustrator”) that slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final cost image sustains a reflective aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic spine—quantifying feeling without reducing it—emerges through image and method (equations murmured, mineral nourishment mirroring emotional dynamics). The repricing moment reframes “mathematics of emotion” as relational transformation, dovetailing with ambiguous loss. A few explicit statements (“wasn’t about cold calculation...”) tilt toward telling, but resonance survives. The final charged poise sustains ambiguity without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres: guardianship of knowledge, invisibility versus service, and the ethics of preservation under institutional neglect. Recurring images (pipes, tape, darkness/sapphire hush) accrue toward an ending that reweights visibility as a sacrificial, indirect act. The last paragraph edges toward summary (“They were the library’s secret keeper...”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Still, the charged final plan provides genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of control vs partnership emerges through particulars and the trellis/leaf motif; the final image reweights prior material. However, explicit statements (“She finally understood…”, and the advisory line to others) edge into moralizing, blunting subtext. Still, the earned cost preserves resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of preservation, art as testimony, and convergence of past/present accrue through object and action. The brooch’s reweighting and the pigments’ provenance bind ethics to craft. Some lines tip toward thesis (“We need artists now more than ever,” “I don’t paint what was lost...”), dulling subtext. Still, the closing image sustains resonance without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme—creation over prediction, the sacredness of “everyday magic,” harmony of light/shadow—emerges organically from images and patterning. However, the final moral statement (“magic wasn’t found in seeing what would be...”) leans into explicit thesis, dulling subtext. Earlier images (“bright darkness,” the cave’s self-composed chords) carry richer resonance without saying it. The piece invites reflection but edges toward didactic in the last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Absence vs. presence, truth vs. false comfort, and communal repair emerge through the valve, the diary, and Elina’s archival ethic. The ending reweights prior images (the valve on the desk; harbor no longer defined by absences) without resorting to a tidy moral. Some lines edge toward essayistic statement (“not with false promises but with the truth”), softening subtext. Yet the final shared‑understanding image carries genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance arises from mapping as a metaphor for comprehending human secrets and the ouroboros of self-renewal. However, the prose occasionally states theme outright (“to unravel the mysteries that prevented humanity from understanding itself”), reducing subtext. The final image of returning nightly at the liminal hour offers a clean thematic hinge. More implication and less declaration would heighten aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of connection across time and the transformation of skepticism into stewardship emerges organically from the tile’s function. Recurrent images (whales, stars, the tile) carry resonance into the last image. Yet the prose often states abstractions (“unheard symphony,” “balance to memories”) rather than letting scene particulars do the work, softening subtext. The ending’s earned note is reflective but flirts with moralizing summary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of grief, purpose, and continuity are coherent and seeded, but the ending states the thesis overtly (“immortality was not a curse...”), dulling resonance. Subtext is outweighed by exposition in the final paragraphs. The last image carries some charge, yet moralizing trims ambiguity. A quieter, image-led close would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of redemption, ethical deception, and transition are organically linked to the setting and the ink pot, and the final image reweights them. Some lines verge on moral summary (“using the tools of deception to create an honest outcome”), trimming subtext. The “death as transition” motif aligns well with the asylum arc. Resonance lingers but is slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and the reality of invented histories accrue through object ritual and recurring images. A direct statement (“invented histories were no less real…”) undercuts subtext, but the final sealing with gold leaf restores resonance. The bonsai labyrinth as epochs offers quiet echo without over‑assertion. Overall nuanced, if a bit declared.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring motifs (palimpsest, tide, containers, poison label) meaningfully converge on a theme of identity as communal memory versus institutional record. The final image rephrases the central question without mechanistic tying-off. Some lines tilt into overt thesis (“identity is not what is written on paper”), blunting subtext. Even so, the piece invites reflection through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Recurring images (cello, compass, Lyra) braid toward a coherent thesis about plural meanings. Yet the theme gets stated overtly—“The universal riddle wasn’t about finding a single answer…”—which blunts subtext, particularly in the final third. The piece invites reflection, but the explicit articulation reads a touch sermonizing, reducing lingering ambiguity. Strong conceptual design, slightly didactic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of communal resilience through hidden systems of meaning arises organically from graffiti-as-archive and the bridging of generations. The stone’s return and earpiece removal reweight belonging without overt moralizing. A few lines edge toward thesis statements (“The water remembers what land forgets”), but they’re embedded in scene and motif. The final spiral-in-circle image delivers a resonant non-literal answer: continuity via adaptive art.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—preservation of vanishing wonder versus progress—is woven through particulars (the grain, the lensing of dawn, the mining approach) and resolves in a resonant image rather than a moral. A few lines lean toward telling (“a testament to what was being sacrificed”), dulling subtext. The final charged poise—images as memorial, silence yielding to machinery—lands. Strong coherence, modest didactic leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Repair as a metaphor for relational continuity accrues through particulars (conductive threads as “neurons,” water optics as sight). Some thematic lines tilt toward telling (“maintained a connection…”) but the final image of calm after aiding the voyage resonates. Ambiguity is modest; the piece favors a tender, affirmative answer over complexity. Still, the repair/connection motif is cleanly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Myth and science intertwine through the “singular convergence” and the condensation/delta inversion, culminating in “not merely where… but why.” Thematic threads are mostly carried by image, with a slight on‑the‑nose line (“They begin with intention”). The final reweighting feels earned by prior particulars and avoids a moral. Resonance lingers, though ambiguity’s cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Harmony, balance, and the ethics of patience emerge organically from the craft and closing chord. The “wild hush” evolves from emptiness to charged peace, offering a non‑literal answer to the town’s malaise. No sermonizing; resonance arises from repeated concrete acts. Slight tidiness and lack of counter-pressure temper the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Time, memory, and the desire to fix the ephemeral accrue through concrete images (luminous particles, vial microcosm) and culminate in a resonant final ascent. A few on‑the‑nose declarations (“This was it—the ephemeral harnessed”) flatten subtext. Still, the reweighting of “gathered hush” into a tangible medium offers an earned, reflective aftertaste. Ambiguity around the distress signal sender adds a faint, intriguing echo.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of truth versus legacy and the ethics of belief are woven through recurring images (lattice, copperlight, reef). The final shift from “crying wolf” to “whispering truth” offers a resonant conceptual answer. Occasional direct declarations (“not in lies, but in truth”) edge toward telling. Overall, subtext carries the weight credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of love as both preservative and poisonous, debt, and transformation recur through concrete particulars (spores, seeds, spiral). The final bloom reweights the narrative with a resonant image of union. However, the last paragraph’s declarative moral (“stood as testimony…”) edges toward on‑the‑nose. Subtext otherwise operates well in image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of art as bridge, lineage, and re‑sacralization emerge organically through the plate, labyrinth, and orchids. Some thematic statements are explicit (“transforming ruin into reverence”), edging toward on‑the‑nose, but the closing image reweights prior motifs credibly. Subtext works best in overlaps—sleepwalking paths vs. ancestor routes. Emotional aftereffect is tender, if somewhat declared.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of time, return, and communal memory emerge organically through the sundial and orchard images; the final alignment recasts prior material with quiet resonance. Subtext in offerings and the old tongue strengthens the spiritual reclamation without over-explaining. The line “We rebuild because we remember” flirts with thesis-statement moralizing and slightly reduces the piece’s subtlety. Despite that, the ending’s image holds reflective weight.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of identity’s fluidity versus enforced transparency, and the sacred slowness of surface mail, recur and culminate in the letter drop. Resonance works through image and ritual, though some lines state the thesis directly (“Each pseudonym was a celebration of identity's fluidity”), softening subtext. The final synthesis is moving but leans on declared insight. Ambiguity remains thoughtful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of hidden labor, misdirection as power, and small disruptions subverting grand schemes surface organically through Elara’s craft and the candle’s constancy. Subtext in the official’s condescension reinforces the social invisibility she leverages. A slightly declarative line (“the most effective resistance often appeared...”) edges toward moralizing but remains within voice. The final image conceptually reprices heroism as quiet, patterned sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of unsent letters, fear, and forgiveness emerge through concrete images (condensation text, the wavering hand before knocking). Subtext lives in what’s withheld and translated by spirits, and the final repricing (“I forgive”) resonates. A few direct statements (“This was why she had come…”) and explicit phrasing nudge toward tidy moral clarity. Still, the emotional aftereffect is authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance arises from concrete particulars (coral, smudged notes, twilight), and the final act reframes absence as translation. However, thematic statements are sometimes declared (“His mission here was clear: to graft new meaning...”), edging toward sermonizing. The piece largely avoids sentimentality, but a few lines articulate the thesis rather than letting images carry it. The afterimage lingers despite those overt notes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Recurring images (fog/light/fruit/dance) braid into a coherent theme about illumination restoring communal joy. However, explicit theses (“human hearts yearned for beauty,” “rekindled the human capacity for wonder”) tip into told moralizing, reducing subtext. The final reprise (“Perhaps all ruins are just stories waiting for the right light”) is apt, if a touch on‑the‑nose. Resonance lingers but could deepen with less assertion and more image‑driven implication.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of synesthesia, art as music, and curiosity replacing mastery emerge organically from the garden, the nickel, and her practice. However, the line “art was merely frozen music” states the thesis overtly, dulling subtext in the final paragraph. Earlier images (visible vibrations, nested revelations) carry resonance effectively without explanation. The ending still invites reflection, but the moralizing tilt trims its power.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Freedom versus quantification resonates through specific images (plants encoding messages, thought-monitors priced by complexity). The closing image of an “untaxed thought” reweights the premise with humane clarity. Occasional explicit formulations (“reclamation of what made them human”) edge toward telling. Subtext operates best in the club’s coded speech and the greenhouse praxis.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of transmuting suffering into communal rest emerges organically through action (lullabies → blossoms → protection). The final image reweights the premise: the poet’s absence becomes presence encoded in the shell, a resonant answer to isolation. No didactic moralizing; motifs (postcard, constellations, bioluminescence) accrue meaning. Slightly emblematic characterization limits moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of preservation vs. oblivion and the ethics of remembrance emerge organically through objects and action (light as healing song, names returning). The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing, though one line edges toward statement (“making preservation all the more essential”). Subtext operates in the ritual’s reverence and the quiet acceptance of eventual loss. Resonant and restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Reconciliation through language and the ethics of promises emerge organically from concrete archival work and the lattice of obligations. The “symphonies of truth” motif refrains meaningfully, if a bit insistently, charging the closing image of crossing the threshold. Occasional thematic repetition (“restore trust after silence”) edges toward told moral. Still, the ending offers a resonant, open answer without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—balance between progress and preservation—emerges through particulars (chain, channels, seasonal mirror pool) and the “encrypted compassion” line reframes legacy as guidance. Some thematic statements read on-the-nose, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the final gesture of leaving her own encoded note usefully echoes the found envelope, offering continuity of care. The resonance is real if not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of reinvention, balance, and continuity of song accrue from particulars (paper trails, pigeon wings, space stone anchoring earthly messages). The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing, answering the central question by embodying a charged poise between past and future. Subtext (grief integrated into craft) operates through object use and environment rather than thesis. It’s resonant and honest, if a shade neat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring images (thresholds, grain, logbook, distances) evolve toward a meaning about transformation and return. However, the piece states its thesis explicitly (“they were portals of transformation,” “return to love”), reducing subtext and inviting sentiment. The final image still resonates because of particulars (corn rustle, prism tears), but moralizing trims ambiguity. The thematic arc is coherent but not subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of belonging across dimensions coheres through the constellational architecture, bioluminescence, and feather-map reprise. Some lines tilt into explicit thesis (“belonging not as a destination”), dulling subtext. The ending’s image reweights the premise, but it edges toward sentimentality. Still, the particulars generally carry meaning more than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme coheres—absence as transformation—but it’s repeatedly stated (“disappearance was not loss, but metamorphosis”; “nothing was ever truly lost”), veering into moralizing. The final paragraphs tell the meaning rather than letting image and subtext do the lift. Still, the seed garden and crater glass reprise give the idea a concrete frame. The resonance is present but not subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres: calculated serendipity versus chance, with the bishop’s diagonal as a lived metaphor. The ending reweights the premise—giving away the mentor’s token to catalyze someone else’s moment reframes Leo’s art as sacrifice, not just cleverness. Some thematic statements are told outright (“ordering randomness”), trimming subtlety. Still, the final image and the woman’s soft confession create earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory versus authoritarian erasure emerge organically via body-as-manuscript and exile-as-sacred choice. Subtext often lives in image (threads of luminous ink, gaps-as-truth), yet a few explicit statements (“rebellion against the forgetting”) flirt with moralizing. The final image offers a resonant non‑literal answer—embodied remembrance—without requiring didactic closure. Complexity is present, though the piece occasionally tells what the images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Imagery (light, glass, ripples) carries theme, but the prose often states the thesis directly (“It had always been about seeing—truly seeing,” “value wasn’t found only in the extraordinary”), edging into sermonizing. The resonance is present yet over‑explained, curbing subtext. The ending answers the question but with a moralized gloss rather than a purely image‑led reweighting. Thoughtful, if didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of survival’s marks and traded innocence emerge through recurring images (crack, scars, stars) and reweight at the end. Occasional direct statements (“survival leaves marks”) verge on telling yet are mostly earned by concrete particulars. The final image resists tidy moralizing, offering a resonant acceptance. Subtext in “companion” vs. “accusation” carries depth.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Control vs. navigation and “trial balloons” as hope are dramatized, not sermonized, and the final outward‑pointing needle reweights prior images. The theme emerges from particulars—tools, tides, and patterns—rather than declaration. The resonance is quiet and durable, though the insight edges toward comfort more than complication. Subtext in the surrender of control lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.6)
    Resonance exists in the idea of walls carrying accumulated human consciousness, and the film/echo bridge is thematically apt. However, the theme is explicitly stated (“what walls dream about is...”), edging into moralizing summary in the final stretch and reducing subtext. More image-led implication at the end would strengthen the afterglow. The legacy motif works but could be earned through action over assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of vocation versus personal possibility, inheritance, and the ephemerality of art emerge organically from ritual, rain, and bells. The alternate lives sequence reweights her choice to endure her calling; the ending’s quiet “Wonderful” avoids moralizing. Subtext around cost and renunciation lingers. Complexity is present without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Recurring motifs (clipboard, celestial dance, cracked beauty) sustain a theme of peace as practice and the ongoing price of redemption. The final image reweights earlier details with bittersweet resonance. However, explicit statements (“Peace… was not an event but a practice”) tip into moralizing, muting subtext. The piece remains thematically cohesive despite some telling.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of culpability, preservation, and the limits of control emerge organically through action and image (map of fractures, rain erasing prints). However, the ending leans into explicit moralizing (“He had preserved hope...”) that states the thesis rather than letting the charged image carry it. The “scientifically impossible” line flattens ambiguity. The subtext otherwise resonates through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of defying conformity through integration emerge through recurring images and the final reweighting of “sanctuary” as a state. However, explicit thesis statements—“freedom comes not through escape but through integration”—flatten subtext, especially so near the end. The closing image (“became both lock and key”) resonates and retrofits prior motifs effectively. More implication and less declaration would heighten afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of ethical storytelling and power reversal is strong but occasionally told outright (“Elias believed…”). Subtext emerges in the audience’s shift and the stick as communal narrator. The ending resonates conceptually yet skirts moralizing with multiple thesis statements. Still, the particulars lend it honesty and after‑tone.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and ritualized witnessing arise from particulars (amber‑trapped wing, dissolving structures) rather than abstract statements. The line “History isn’t just in books” flirts with didacticism but is counterweighted by image‑driven beats. The ending reweights the premise with a tender CR: honoring as a temporary, costly act that still matters. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around craft-as-mnemosyne, earned forgiveness, and stewardship; images (rope, card, aurora) accrue meaning and reweight in the final tableau. The line “The names must be preserved” flirts with thesis-stating, but most resonance arises from concrete action and charged objects. The ending’s “work just beginning” reframes the quest into vocation without moralizing. Complexity is steady if not piercingly paradoxical.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres around destiny as a reciprocal dance of choice and calling, with a strong object‑based throughline (directive → map of possibilities). However, the thesis is stated outright in the closing lines, reducing subtext. The realization reweights prior images, but the moral clarity feels a bit neat. Resonant but over‑told at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Science as devotion and numbers as prayer resonate through recurring images and culminate in the covenant marks. However, theme is stated overtly (“proven that faith and science were not enemies”), undercutting subtext. The final charged image does reweight prior material without full moral tidy‑up. Ambiguity remains in a good way about the source and nature of the “covenant.”

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of forgiveness, transformation, and reconfiguration of harm into healing are coherent and image‑driven (broken pin repaired; two boxes in harmony). Some thematic statements are on‑the‑nose (“Your resentment is like that broken pin”), muting subtext. The final silent‑melody image resonates and reweights earlier motifs without overexplaining. Ambiguity around cost lingers enough to invite reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of permeability and recreation arise from particulars (tools, breath, sextant), culminating in a refusal that reweights “capture” into “navigation/freedom.” A few direct declarations (“Boundaries are merely reflections...”) tilt toward thesis statement, slightly dulling subtext. The final image invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (apples, ribbon, mosaic, seed) support a clear theme of seasonal promises and enduring roots. The final act (planting the seed near ancestral names) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about tending lineage. However, explicit thesis statements (“Some vows are deciduous, but roots remain”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. When the piece trusts image over declaration, it’s affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme (limits of linear time vs. forbidden omniscience) emerges through object, setting, and final acceptance. The cameo and “nonlinear inheritance” recur and reweight the end image. Some lines verge on thesis‑telling (“knowledge forbidden not because it was dangerous...”), softening subtext. Still, the final quiet image and his redefined purpose produce a lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of absence-as-opportunity and the ethical dimension of rescue accumulate through concrete images (pressed flora, living books, “lessons as prisons”). However, the final moral line (“Some lessons can only be learned through rescue missions”) states what the images already imply, softening resonance. Subtext exists in how language soothes rage, but complexity is partially over-explained. The ending still reweights earlier material meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of identity, remembrance, and communal memory emerge organically through objects (emerald card, tree) and place. The “trapped freedom” motif reweights the ending, and the final acceptance offers a resonant answer. However, some lines state theme overtly (“true purpose…to give voice”) instead of trusting implication, slightly dulling subtext. The closing image still lingers with earned poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around translating absence into legibility and the ethics of opening sealed times. Recurring particulars (seal, rope, clock) carry resonance, but subtext remains light and the ending asserts clarity rather than complicating it. The “fables as warnings” angle invites complexity that the piece doesn’t fully exploit. Emotional aftereffect is pleasing more than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of harmonizing versus opposing is integrated through action (counter‑frequency, bloom of hush), yet the story undercuts subtext with explicit statements: “the most powerful magic was not in commanding energies...” and a final moralizing cadence. The strongest thematic moment is the beings settling into complementary rhythm, which could stand without the overt articulation. Resonance is present but over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance emerges from the rekindled beacon as possibility, but thematic statements sometimes tip into declaration (“coincidences were not random at all”). The final harmony of pavilion and beacon is a strong image that reweights earlier motifs. Subtextually, silence as agency (“shard of hush”) is compelling, though occasionally explained rather than embodied. The piece invites reflection even if it edges toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of memory, identity, and meaning emerge organically through crystals, shadows, and the summer‑quill. The final charged poise—his vow carried by the crystals into the solid fog—reweights prior images effectively. Occasional thesis‑forward lines (“To sculpt identity from experience…”) flirt with moralizing but don’t overwhelm the scene. Resonance is earned via image, though complexity is gentler than peak‑tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Art as defiance of despair emerges through particulars (coded craft, charged colors, responsive mosaics/flowers) rather than sermon. The final image reweights the premise without a spelled‑out moral, though “defy the gravity of hopelessness” borders on stated thesis. Subtext of ritual, craft, and community response is elegant but not deeply conflicted. Resonance is earned, if slightly safe.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of “transition periods as substance” integrates well with pools, stars, and metamorphosis. However, the piece repeatedly states its thesis (“The texture of time…”) rather than letting image and action fully do the work, edging toward sermonizing. Subtext appears in the pause and indirectness, but it’s often explained. The final image resonates, though it could trust implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of confinement vs. transcendence, inheritance vs. self‑made solace, and the phenomenology of silence accrue through particulars (tastes of silences, the bone‑felt chime). The final juxtaposition (doll as comfort in confinement; vessel as charged freedom) reweights what “safety” means without stating a moral. Insights feel earned by experience rather than declared. Ambiguity remains purposeful: healing is implied, not assured.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—silence as an intentional, healing craft—emerges through repeated, concrete moments (passengers’ bodies loosening, the businessman's tie loosening). The final image reframes silence as ongoing labor under impermanence, which resonates. Some lines state thesis directly (“His motivation was simple yet profound...”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the imagery carries genuine aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stewardship over sovereignty and honoring past/future emerge organically from image and action (peeling history to enable renewal). The ending affirms duty over power, though the phrasing edges toward declarative summation. The ruby/throne imagery provides thematic echo without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if softly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of careful destruction as prelude to healing and connection through scars arise from concrete acts (ring use, threshold crossing). Recurring images (ash, starlight, scars) gain new weight at the end as dawn breaks. A few lines trend toward overt thesis (“Some lessons must be learned in darkness…”) which slightly dulls subtext. Still, resonance lingers via the charged final walk toward dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    The pressure‑to‑diamonds metaphor tracks to personal redemption and returns in the final image. However, the theme is stated overtly (“proving that sometimes the most extraordinary gifts…”) rather than earned through subtext. Little counter‑pressure complicates the moral calculus. Resonance is present but on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thematic throughline—truth via resonance versus power via deception—emerges organically through the gramophone method and charged images. However, direct statements (“truth would finally reign”) flatten subtext at the end. The final image (shadows following him) carries some resonance but lacks a felt price. Insight is present but a shade declared rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of exile, vocation beyond duty, and sanctioned/forbidden knowledge emerge organically through the marionette guide and the allegiance ritual. The final reconfiguration—keeper of “unsnapped worlds”—offers a resonant answer to the opening question without moralizing. Recurring images (fruit, glass light, shifting ink) carry subtext effectively. Slightly soft cost keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of small kindnesses echoing across time is embodied in particulars (coat, stray dog, research notes) and culminates in the button’s return binding two lives. A few lines lean toward overt thesis (“testament to how small kindnesses…”), but most resonance arises from image and action. The final recognition functions as earned repricing of the room’s purpose. Subtext lives in her chosen solitude versus his lack of alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Memory versus erasure, indifference versus attention, and “coded freedom” recur through concrete images (reflections, the key, reappearing faces). The final image reweights earlier motifs, but the text slips into explicit moralizing (“first crack in their wall of indifference,” “foundation for rebuilding”), dulling subtext. Still, the thematic thread is coherent and earned through events rather than solely declared. Resonance lingers more conceptually than emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Music versus silence, code versus counter‑vibration, and chosen burden versus release cohere without moralizing. The final image reweights prior motifs—the hush becomes comfort rather than threat. Some lines verge on telling theme (“no ordinary performance”), but the recurring images carry the weight. Resonance lingers through the idea that absence (negative space) can be an act.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Memory, stewardship, and cyclical becoming accrue through seeds, monuments, and the hush; the final beacon image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. A line like “served a greater purpose” edges toward explicitness but doesn’t overwhelm the scene. Resonance lingers, though moral complexity and cost remain gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres (imperfection as harmony) through image patterning (erratic needle, natural clocks), culminating in a reweighted final stance. Subtext surfaces when calm steadies the needle; the environment mirrors his internal shift. Yet explicit thesis lines (“motivation to befriend uncertainty,” “dance with chaos,” “feature of life itself”) flatten resonance and edge toward moralizing. The piece invites reflection but says what it has also shown.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of naming, identity, and kintsugi‑style redemption are coherent and recur through action (etching, gold leaf). The final image reweights failure as wisdom, but the text leans into explicit thesis statements (“wisdom forged in failure”) that dull subtext. Resonance is present, yet a touch didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—confession needs joy to complete healing—emerges from action (bell and laughter) and object use rather than pure assertion. The “luminous ache” motif threads through and recharges the ending. One line edges toward moralizing (“confession is the first step...”), slightly on‑the‑nose. Still, the final release carries earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme is coherent and grows from particulars (strap, UV exposure, body as compass), culminating in a conceptual reweighting of mercy. However, lines like “Mercy isn’t the absence of pain…” and the explicit formula (“time over pain… diminishing returns… intention”) read as thesis statements rather than purely emergent resonance. The final insight is compelling yet a bit didactic. Subtext otherwise operates through image and body.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of legacy, stewardship, and recovering silenced stories surface organically in images (dots like constellations, the fragment’s glow). However, several lines state the thesis outright (“As the between-worlds translator I was always meant to be”), which trims ambiguity and subtext. The final image offers resonance but leans toward affirmation over complexity. The piece invites reflection more than it complicates it.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (ceilings, dust, buzz, cracks) braid into a theme of perception and acceptance; “weightless burden” reframes to calling at the end. The final image (ticking bridging worlds) offers a non-literal answer about connection through craft. A touch of thesis-y assertion (“confirming what… he had always believed”) blunts subtext. Overall resonance is earned more by image than by moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of preservation versus liberation and the price of containing infinity emerge organically through events and images, not sermonized. The final image (new frost patterns, knowledge flowing) reweights the premise with felt cost and possibility. Motifs reprise with altered meaning (frost as omen, then genesis), yielding resonant conceptual repricing. No tidy moral—complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of reframing truth and the ethical power of myth emerge organically via the shard, mirrors, storm, and manuscript. The final constellation image and the broken‑yet‑beautiful vase meaningfully reprice prior material. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (“The past should not be excavated…”) flirt with thesis‑statement territory, softening subtlety. Still, the piece sustains resonant ambiguity without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Truth versus dishonesty, resonance as preservation, and “reclaimed light” cohere thematically. The chamber as sanctuary of truth elegantly supports the motif. Some lines tip into thesis (“music was the truest language of all”), softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring particulars (petrichor, the compass, transitional water/earth) carry a coherent theme of transformation and permeability of boundaries. The ending reweights prior material—her collection becomes apprenticeship for dissolution of observer/observed. A couple lines verge on declarative theme (“where explanations fail”), but the imagery mostly does the work. Resonance lingers more as wonder than as conflicted ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (continuity across time, simple forms holding complex truths) is coherent but over-explicit, with repeated thesis-like statements. The final moral—“simplicity can indeed scaffold the most complex truths”—reads as declarative rather than earned via image alone, blunting resonance. Subtext is thin; symbols (archway, slide, hum) point directly to stated meanings rather than carrying ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but unsurprising.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around perception, transformation, and environment shaping revelation. The final image reweights prior motifs (glass, water, ice) convincingly. However, the explicit thesis sentences (“Flowers bloomed at night not to hide from the sun…”) edge into statement rather than purely emergent image. The piece remains resonant but would gain power by trusting image over articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of intergenerational memory, truth versus official narrative, and healing through dialogue emerge organically from the objects and actions (diaries as bridge; debris messages as parley). The obsidian lagoon reweights the question of how history speaks back. Occasional explicit moralizing (“Letters... first step toward healing the wounds of history”) slightly overstates what the images already convey. The ending’s conceptual repricing resonates without a tidy moral, though it edges close to telling.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme—rejecting false comfort for communal transformation—is coherent and integrated, with the bottle’s redefinition offering resonance. However, the piece often states its thesis outright (“Physical improvements without cultural renewal...”), edging toward sermonizing and reducing subtext. The ending’s image supports the idea but arrives with limited ambiguity or counter‑pressure. Emotional aftereffect is thoughtful but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Memory, language, and medium (wax) interweave to explore how emotions outlast words and become duty. The “velvet disquiet” and silent foghorn resonate thematically without moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: the medium becomes oracle, and archiving becomes an ethical imperative. Ambiguity lingers productively around fate vs. agency.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of preservation vs experience, order vs entropy, and mortality’s reweighting of time emerge from images and choices, not sermon. The final repricing (“texture of borrowed time” = “texture of herself”) is resonant, if a shade explicit. Recurring motifs (seeds, acorn, starlight, ice) deepen the inquiry without tokenism. Complexity remains, with the paradox of “wild serenity” credibly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of listening vs. noise, old craft vs. modern automation emerge through action and image, culminating in the bell’s autonomy. Subtext rides his solitude and tactile attention, and the solstice hush frames a resonant repricing. A few direct statements (“In an age of information overload…”) edge into sermonizing, slightly dulling the organic resonance. Still, the final image meaningfully reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres: vulnerability as strength and “flourishing stillness” are embodied by the glass and the stars’ transformations. Yet several sentences state the thesis outright, especially near the end, which edges toward sermonizing and dilutes subtext. The final image reweights prior material, but complexity is limited—few counter-pressures or ambiguities remain. Resonance is earned, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of silence as covenant emerges through action and recurring images rather than lecture, culminating in travelers learning to “gaze upon beauty without comment.” A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“the most profound truths lived in silence—especially apologies…”) but don’t derail the organic resonance. The final image offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection without vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—time as textured, communal knowledge—arises through the capsule’s mundane-coded messages and Elara’s adoption of the method. The garage-sale lexicon gives the idea fresh subtextual texture. Some lines drift toward stated maxims (“Measurements are relative, trust your senses”), shaving subtlety. The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Resonance emerges through recurring images (feather, lagoon, woven dawns, kite) that shift meaning at the end, but thematic statements are often told outright. The line “Her motivation was simple yet profound” and the final moral—“sometimes, letting go is the way to hold on tightest”—tip into sermonizing. Subtext exists in the kite beat, yet the closing paragraphs explain what the images already show. The piece would gain by trusting the images to carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of mortality-as-deadline, stewardship, and interspecies respect emerge through the copper “language” and the orchard’s awakening. Occasional direct statements (“His motivation crystallized...”) blunt subtlety, but the final symphony of light and breath reframes death as continuity without sermonizing. The diary’s legacy and the pillars’ shared wisdom support a resonant, non‑literal answer. Quiet but lasting aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of return, ritual vs. science, and recognition recur through images (amber, footprints, tower) and pay off in a reweighted understanding. But the piece often states its thesis outright—“The chemistry of homecoming isn’t about returning…,” and “all beings seek to return to their origin”—flattening subtext at the end. The resonance is credible yet leans didactic. Imagery supports, but the final moralizing line blunts complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Restoration, interspecies concord, and language as covenant emerge organically through acts and images (songs to soil, birds as guides). However, the explicit moralizing phrase “narrow vastness—the idea that even the smallest actions...” blunts subtext. The final image (war to wildflowers; hunger to abundance) resonates, but complexity is trimmed by the neat, summary epilogue. The theme is moving yet slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic throughline—knowledge vs proximity, distance redefined—emerges organically through the decoding method and the reunion image. The leaf/groove motif shifts meaning at the end, but the explicit line “Home is not a place...” flirts with moralizing. Resonance lingers due to the charged objects and final poise, though complexity is kept safe. Capped by limited escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of legacy, orientation, and mapping hope cohere via recurring images (compass, star charts). The ending offers a non-literal answer—true north as inner compass—consistent with earlier beats. Some lines verge on moralizing and explicit thesis-stating (“to be the cartographer of hope”) which blunts subtext. Still, the motif economy supports resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Chess-as-life strategy and “embrace the unknown” recur, but theme is told directly (“Because life is a strategy game”), flattening subtext. The sundial’s repair offers a neat answer without lingering ambiguity or price. Still, the recurring objects and Kael’s reframed desire give some resonance. The ending leans inspirational over interrogative.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of memory’s fragility and the power of small gestures emerges through the pawn’s return and the gallery’s echoing agency. Subtext lives in images (missing pawns, luminous absence) rather than preachy statements, though the line “They’re not just statistics” edges toward telling. The final stance reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of belonging and perception emerge through images (mercury glass, feather, thunder) and culminate in a reweighted final vista. However, the explicit articulation (“home wasn’t a place at all”) flirts with moralizing and reduces subtext. Resonance remains, but complexity is smoothed. The afterimage is warm more than unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Redemption through humility emerges from concrete particulars (threads, labyrinth reflection, the prince’s gaze) rather than thesis. However, the last line edges into overt moralizing (“redemption had been his all along”), slightly flattening subtext. Recurring images (woven hush, thunder, threads) reweight meaning at the end. Emotional aftereffect is genuine, quiet, and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme is coherent and integrated through recurring images (light/prism/echo) and the final reprise (“I am truth’s reflection, not its container”). However, the piece often states its thesis directly (“The truth cannot be contained”), edging into sermonizing that reduces subtext. The ending resonates conceptually but offers a tidy moral rather than a layered ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect leans intellectual more than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kintsugi functions as a coherent thematic throughline reweighted at the end; images (pockmarks, acid breach, lost apprentice) do the work. However, the closing lines verge on thesis-stating (“He was never meant to erase… transform… profound truth”), reducing subtext. Still, the theme emerges from the ritual rather than meta-commentary for most of the piece. The final insight resonates without insisting on a moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Temporary eternity” develops through the mirror motif, the shell, and the final canvas, culminating in a reweighted understanding. The nature-assisted preservation of his promise provides resonant thematic payoff. One line (“temporary eternity wasn’t a contradiction”) verges on stating the thesis. Overall, theme emerges from image and action rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of gentleness over force and purified intent accrue through image and ritual, culminating in the sister’s distant stirring. However, the captain’s declarative moral (“the sea listens best to those who speak to it softly”) tips into on‑the‑nose statement, blunting subtext. The jasmine and cork do good thematic work. Resonance lingers but with a touch of sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of return, ritual, and the “geography of loss” accrue organically via image and action, and the ending’s quiet welcome reweights earlier solitude into communal hope. Occasional explicit statements (“The reverse migration wasn’t just physical; it was spiritual”) tilt toward telling. Still, the censer and moon-phase rhythm carry subtext about endurance and earned solace. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of boundaries versus connection and transforming liability into gift are coherent and arise from action. The storm clearing and second eye provide resonant images that support a hopeful reconfiguration. However, the text states its thesis explicitly (“the relics weren’t meant to…”) which undercuts subtext. The resulting resonance is sturdy but a touch didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of witnessed isolation, grief transmission, and release arise from action and image rather than lecture. The Edelweiss reframes from clue to sacrament, and the mirrored gesture offers a non‑literal answer. A faintly declarative line (“understood now—was meant to understand”) trims some ambiguity, but the final tableau with sea, mist, and stars restores resonance. The piece invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: overlooked wisdom (ants), maps vs. lived paths, and translating tools into choices. The final image repurposes the chip and reframes solitude as chosen, offering resonant repricing without a spelled‑out moral. Occasional explicitness (“wasn’t a literal passage”) slightly flattens subtext. Still, the motifs accrue honestly and pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—self beyond role, duty reimagined through contact with older magic—emerges through concrete images (reflection of a younger self, firefly ritual, secret wellspring). Some lines slide toward overt statement (“The grotto shows your true self”), slightly flattening subtext. The final smile at the counselors reframes power quietly without moralizing. The firefly reprise provides a gentle, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—capturing transformation rather than light alone—emerges from recurring images (pocket‑suns, shell spiral, ember nexus) and culminates in a reweighted final method. Subtext operates in the charged friendship and the nexus responding to their exchange. A few abstract phrases (“density of presence”) edge toward telling but mostly rest on concrete particulars. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of mortality, recurrence, and mapping consciousness emerge from concrete images (grave stone, upward snow, scroll) more than from didactic statements. A few lines verge on thesis (“He was a cartographer of consciousness”), but the final image of dawn and pen carries resonance. The “grave as cradle” motif reweights prior material effectively. Complexity persists without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of loss, inheritance, and “ordinary miracles” emerge through the recurring object and the water‑clock motif. The final exchange (“Perhaps we both help people transition”) risks on‑the‑nose articulation, slightly dulling subtext. Still, image‑led resonance—drips marking time as warmth returns—carries an honest aftertaste. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing, mostly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—transmuting trauma into communal wisdom via ritual and craft—emerges through particulars (scar turned to warning rune, childhood knots, breath between tempests). The final image conceptually reprices the premise: a scholar’s scars become legacy, confirmed by the quill’s shed tip. No sermonizing; resonance lingers in the charged hush returning as a chosen stasis. Complexity remains in the visible cost and disciplined restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of guilt, repair, and “imperfect miracles” arise from concrete actions and images (scent as key, arc bridge, incomplete sheet). Subtext in dialogue avoids neat moralizing; acceptance “begins the healing” without pretending to finish it. One aphoristic line risks sentimentality, but the ending image reweights prior material effectively. Resonance lingers without didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of unity vs. separation threads through recurring images (spiral, hush, fragments) and culminates in merging the triad into one hush. The ending offers a resonant answer without a stated moral, though the piece occasionally states theme outright (“motivation… unravel cosmic illusions”), blunting subtext. The dictionary as doorway transitions from tool to ontological hinge. The spiral notion reconfigures “in/out” effectively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of time as presence and meaning arise organically from the reversal and observation motifs, and the final vow ties them to action. However, several explicit thesis lines (“humans tried to capture time in boxes…,” “Clocks measure what we give them”) edge into sermonizing, reducing subtext. The best moments are image‑led (reversed water, layered silence) and could carry more weight alone. Resonance lingers but is told‑forward in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Thematic throughline—boundaries that connect, not imprison—emerges organically via the device and gestures. The final image is resonant, yet explicit moralizing (“security wasn’t about building walls…”) dulls subtext. Still, the reconfiguration from intrusion to guardianship carries authentic charge. A touch more implication and less statement would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—responsible engagement with uncertainty versus mastery—emerges through particulars (weighted dice, subway equations, father’s stress). The final stance is earned and resonates without a neat moral, though some lines approach thesis‑speak. Recurring images reweight at the end (lantern, midsummer melancholy). The piece invites reflection beyond plot through coherent ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of endings/beginnings, estrangement, and accidental connection emerge cleanly through images (disc, tunnel, looping calls). However, the piece states its thesis outright multiple times (“to teach endings how to begin”), including in the final movement, which blunts resonance. Subtext exists in the disc’s sonic haunting but is sometimes overwritten into moral. The closing hope lands, but with a whiff of sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Recurring images (walnut ink, locket, jetty flowers) accumulate to a resonant statement about memory and transformation. However, lines like “The regenerated covenant… is not between ink and paper, but between what was and what might be remembered” drift toward explicit thesis. The final turn reweights prior material effectively without a moral. Emotional aftertaste lingers as intended.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Reciprocity, anonymity, and performative cheer cohere into a theme that reweights itself at the end—connection arises from the rumor’s sharing, not the object. The moon rock and “polite anarchy” function as motifs that gain meaning at closure. A few lines state insights a touch directly, slightly reducing subtextual power. Overall resonance lingers and avoids tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme coheres (blindness as altered perception; grief into acceptance) and arises from tactile, sonic images. However, late moralizing lines (“the greatest territory to chart was… the universe within” and “never been a disability”) flatten subtext into statement. The recurring images (ring, notes, stillness) do carry resonance at the end. With less overt thesis-articulation, this would land with more afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of humility, corrigibility, and meaning made through contingency emerge from particulars (the pen’s “not command but suggestion,” the garden of wrong seeds). A couple of thesis-like lines (“history was… written in pen, not stone”) tip into didactic clarity. The final promise under the anomaly achieves a credible, quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silence-as-music, memory/oblivion, and inheritance cohere through recurring images (hands, camera, water) and culminate without a moral. The theme arises from action—translating the woman’s grief and the harbor’s quietude—rather than thesis statements. A few overt lines (“silence was not emptiness”) and repeated “joyful sorrow” slightly blunt subtlety. Overall resonance lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Destruction vs. preservation threads organically through objects and acts (arsonist restores art; tapestry as memory), and the ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer by action. Some heavy‑handed statements (“Fire destroys, but art preserves”; “Like all great stories…”) blunt subtext and edge toward moralizing. The “volcanic tenderness” motif evolves convincingly to a softened resolve. Overall theme is coherent and earned, if a shade explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Recurring images (drumming, auric lagoon, inhaling universe) accrue into a resonant meditation on defiance and love. One line edges into thematic exposé (“separation becomes merely an illusion…”), dulling subtext at the brink of closure. The ending still reweights the premise through image rather than moral. Earned melancholy avoids sentimentality overall.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of subtlety-over-brute-force and how systems carry quiet authority emerge organically from action and image. Recurring objects (coin, maps) support a craft-as-faith motif without heavy-handed moralizing. The final image reweights prior details (coin cooled, new map) but stops short of a deeper ethical reckoning or complexity between methods. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of empathy beyond language and light’s meaning through shadow emerge organically through action and image. Occasional explicit restatements (“teach darkness the value of stars”) flirt with on‑the‑nose, but the final cadence reweights them rather than moralizes. The unspoken secret as shared charge delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of invitation over coercion and “seeing the board differently” emerge organically via chess puzzles and public discourse. Some phrasing drifts toward overt thesis (“forests of second thoughts” recurs as slogan), trimming ambiguity. Still, the final images reweight the premise convincingly. The piece leaves a gentle afterglow rather than a complex ache.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of self-recovery and remembering rather than remaking accrue through the island lore and the scrimshaw’s revealing fragments. The final submersion image reweights earlier emptiness with earned release. A few explicit lines (“where one’s true nature could find perfect expression,” and the closing aphoristic frame) edge toward stated thesis. Still, the whale-call ritual and dissolution imagery do most of the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of authenticity versus performance, grief’s place post‑mandate, and the lie of perfection emerge from concrete acts (whittling figures of outlawed emotions, preserving forbidden flowers). Subtext operates in the blank face versus expressive carvings and the turbines’ “stillness within motion.” A few lines verge on thesis statements (“Perfection was the mandate’s lie”) but are justified by the performative frame. The final image offers a resonant non‑literal answer: equilibrium as human locus.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of art versus prohibition and boundaries as thresholds cohere, with luminous images (mirror-lake, transferred hum) carrying resonance. However, explicit thesis lines (“proving that art and spirit could not be truly contained”) flatten subtext. The ending reweights prior images but leans on overt statement where implication would suffice. Earned, but not elusive.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of beauty in imperfection and earned awakenings are coherent and seeded by particulars (arrangements, Gideon’s hands, gray/colour contrast). However, the final paragraph edges into moralizing (“awakenings come not when we demand them…”), reducing subtext. The color‑return beat offers a resonant reweighting, nicely reframing gray as still beautiful. Overall impact is felt but slightly told.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around sound as memory and object as vessel, developed through concrete images (the lens, tunnel-song) rather than mere abstraction. A few stated questions (“What if…”) verge on thesis-telling but are redeemed by the miners’ chorus beat. The ending reweights earlier material with a quiet, lingering resonance. Complexity is present without forced moral.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around grief’s metabolization into service; the phoenix motif and “withering to bloom” recur with earned tenderness. Subtext lives in restraint (she never speaks of her daughter) and the charged ritual of illumination. Occasional abstract formulations (“teach withering to bloom again”) edge toward stated thesis but are supported by particulars. The ending reweights prior images without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of inherited knowledge, pattern‑seeking, and ethical use of insight cohere through objects and images. However, some lines state thesis directly (“reverse engineer the cultural algorithms...”), dulling subtext. The ending’s “responsibility” gesture resonates but edges toward telling rather than purely earned image. Still, the grandmother’s tape and rain carry meaningful thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and the cost of knowledge emerge organically from the method and its price. The “end of innocence” refracts through images rather than moralizing, with the final charged acceptance reframing history as lived archive. A few lines verge on declarative (“a new kind of history was being written”) but do not undercut resonance. The final smile through tears earns its ache.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of love’s persistence, grief, and the ethics of witnessing emerge through image (shadow to light, charged stone) rather than plot machination. The final repricing (not an anomaly but a reunion attempt) resonates. However, several explicit thematic lines (“not an anomaly to fear, but love’s persistence…”) nudge toward moralizing and reduce subtextual power. The piece still leaves a reflective aftertaste anchored in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—transformation over erasure; vigilance joined to compassion—emerges through the chameleon’s shed and the dawn image. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Reconstructing isn’t about forgetting,” “balance self‑respect and compassion”), edging toward moralizing. The final image still resonates, but subtlety yields at key moments. Subtext exists in the parallel of the healed tail, yet is occasionally over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (scars, plants, hourglass, rings) converge to a coherent theme of integration over excavation, culminating in a resonant final image (emptied hourglass, new beginnings). However, the piece states its thesis outright multiple times (“healing wasn’t about opening wounds…”), edging into moralizing. Subtext exists but is undercut by explicit restatements.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—love preserved in liminal spaces and art as conduit—emerges through objects and action (film chemistry, pauses before illumination). The final image reweights prior motifs without needing overt moralizing, though lines like “She had been chosen for this work” and purpose declarations edge toward didactic. Subtext lives in tactile ritual and the cathedral‑like booth. Resonance lingers, even if a hair too declarative at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of attention, curation versus silence, and ancestral skill emerge through image and ritual. However, the line “To free trapped creativity… was not about silencing the world but learning to distill…” states the thesis too directly, damping subtext. The ending image still resonates with a recalibrated listening and a charged threshold. Overall strong, with a touch of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of conservation, time’s fracture, and fragile hope emerge via recurring images and pattern breaks (the clock’s single tick). Subtext around presence vs dispersion reads in the Archivist exchange and the choice to leave again. One line edges into telling (“not from duty…but from love”), slightly flattening nuance. The final image reweights prior motifs without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of consciousness projecting reality, navigation by patterned perception, and accepting “probable miracles” arise organically from events and recurring images. The final repricing (home vs. frontier; integration of the gear) resonates, though a few lines overstate the thesis (“accepting probable miracles as the natural state”). Subtext is present in the wind‑language idea but largely named rather than implied. The aftertaste is contemplative but not complexly ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of quiet, patient courage and earned stewardship emerge organically from action and objects, with strong recurring images reweighted at the end. A minor on-the-nose line (“not the kind that battles monsters”) flattens subtext slightly. The final image of invisible dragons as “living star-stamps” resonates without a moral. Reflection is earned and not sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silence vs. music and safety vs. isolation resonate through recurring images and culminate in a reweighted final image. Subtext—sacrifice, community bound in walls—mostly works through discovery and action. However, explicit theme statements (“safety wasn’t the absence of danger”) blunt subtlety in the climax. The piece invites reflection but leans a little declarative in the last third.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of power, truth vs blood, and self-confrontation surface organically through the messages and the final repricing of “pretender.” The last image (“pellet dissolved into light,” “rune of drift faded”) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity remains—she forgoes the throne narrative for guardianship—avoiding a pat lesson. A touch of explicitness (“not a usurper … but a manifestation of Elara’s own fear”) edges toward telling but doesn’t blunt resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring motifs (paths, drifting/moored, delayed revelation, periodically eternal) cohere into a resonant meditation on change and stewardship. The ending reweights earlier images without sermonizing, though a few lines skirt direct thesis (“wasn’t merely rising tides…it was the Earth…”). Subtext lives in the witness posture versus urge to control. The rebirth/erasure paradox lands with honest ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of liminality, legacy, and chosen responsibility emerge through the opera glasses and stone circle, but the final moral statements (“she was the meaning,” “revolution of the spirit”) edge into sermonizing. Subtext exists in the dropped glasses as relinquishing inherited optics, yet the text often tells the thesis directly. The result resonates but leans sentimental rather than complex. A more oblique final image would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—evolving tradition with intent versus rigid adherence—coheres through the plant guidance, suppressed texts, and final retrieval. However, explicit statements (“not to replace tradition, but to evolve it”) flatten subtext in the last movement, edging into thesis articulation. The final image carries resonance but is explained rather than allowed to radiate complexity. More implication and a cost shadow would deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “anchoring optimism in realism” arises through ritual, teaching children, and the pearl metaphor that reweights the ending. A few sentences state the thesis outright, softening subtext (“not despite… but because of it”). Still, the final image carries resonance without didactic wrap-up. The oyster/pearl motif is coherent and transformed by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres—embracing fragmentation as meaning—reinforced by the threads/tarot motif and the final reweighting. However, several explicit thesis statements (“wasn’t life a collection of fragmented realities…,” “art was not about seeing everything clearly”) tip into overt moralizing, especially near the end. Subtext is present but occasionally stated instead of implied. The concluding image still resonates despite some tell.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance arises from image and ordeal (ink patterns as time’s malleability), but the thesis is stated outright in the last lines, dulling subtext. The piece still invites reflection on perception vs. objective time through concrete particulars. The conceptual repricing is credible, just slightly over-explained. A touch less declarative moral would elevate the lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—who controls history and the ethics of preservation vs. liberation—emerges organically from action and imagery. The final charged stillness reweights prior material without needing an explicit moral. Some lines edge into thesis declaration, trimming subtlety. The resonance lingers through the thaw/ice motif and her chosen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of repurposing violence into care and weaving continuity through chaos resonate through objects and actions (sandbag, roses, “engraved quiet”). However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Her greatest achievement was not in the roses themselves…”) which blunts subtext. The final image still carries a genuine, quiet aftereffect. Complexity is present but not contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of seeking understanding through silence and craft accrue organically from images (nets of emotion, pattern‑breaking windows). However, explicit moralizing (“what is fishing but…”) blunts the subtext’s power in the final third. The ending reweights earlier motifs (echo changes him/world), but the statemented insight mutes the afterglow. Strong resonance, slightly over‑told.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of seeing past appearances, legacy, and logic-as-intervention cohere and are supported by recurring images (stars/orbits, pen). Subtext flickers in the playful solemnity of her process and setting. However, overt statements (“the most powerful intervention is showing people what they’ve refused to see”) edge toward moralizing, muting resonance. The ending reweights prior material but could carry deeper ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Grief, preservation, and translation (sound/amber/memory) interlock; the insect’s “prison” becoming “sanctuary” elegantly reprices the premise. The lullaby subverts the firmware’s baby‑cry translation, reframing voice, silence, and atonement without moralizing. Recurring images (constellations → code → tattooed notes) shift meaning at the end. Thematic complexity lingers without being obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—wisdom through embracing chaos and pattern—is earned through concrete acts (mandala, acoustics, communal creation). The final shift from “lilac unease” to contentment resonates. However, a couple lines drift toward overt moralizing (“wisdom emerges…from finding patterns within it”), softening subtext. The thematic answer is clear and coherent yet a touch stated.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory-as-mercy and naming-as-salvage emerge organically through action and image. Subtext works through objects and atmosphere, but the line “We are not the fire” and the final moralizing phrase (“aberrant mercy… most enduring form of strength”) tilt toward telling. The ending reweights prior images (tessera, sky) effectively. Insight feels earned but a touch declared.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of art as repair, hope (The Star), and relinquishment emerge organically through image and action. The final repricing—saving the orchard by surrendering the endless encore—resonates without moralizing. A few lines verge on abstraction (“sang of… the enduring nature of hope”) but do not derail the felt images. The star coin’s reprise enriches the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—science/art convergence, embodied knowledge, and belief in human resilience—emerges from actions and recurring images (fractals, light mapping, somatic markers). The final turn avoids magic and lands on human spirit, reweighting prior material. Slight overstatement (“became a believer”) trims subtlety in the last lines. Still, the images largely carry resonance without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of stewardship, memory, and translation emerge, with the fossil reframing history as a living archive. Yet the piece states insights (“a key to understanding”) rather than earning them through contested action, softening resonance. The final image is hopeful but tidy, with little ambivalence or shadow cost to linger. Subtext gives way to explicit thesis in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The motif chain (sand/hourglasses → buttons → echo) supports the theme of shared wisdom. However, the piece states its moral directly (“wisdom grows when shared”), flattening subtext. Resonance exists but leans toward sermonizing in the final third. Ambiguity around cost or counter‑pressures is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of repair vs. acceptance emerges through objects and acts, not just assertion, culminating in “fractures as maps.” Recurrent motifs reweight at the end (ashes nourishing growth; the key at the lattice center). A few thesis‑like lines (“The hardest part isn’t the betrayal…”) edge toward telling. Still, the final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liminality, continuity, and duty arise organically through recurring particulars (gutters, thread, vows layered like vellum). The final realization reweights the premise without sermonizing, and the needle’s ritual offers a resonant answer. Occasionally the diction edges toward overt abstraction (“distill complexity into essence”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the thematic weave mostly holds with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Recurring images (glass, smoke, phototropism) align convincingly with a compassion‑sustains‑time theme. Yet the final paragraphs articulate the thesis directly (“resistance to change… loyal memory of love”), tipping into overt moralizing that blunts subtext. The most resonant moments are imagistic (flowers tilting toward him; smoke bending light), which could have carried the theme without declaratives. Emotional aftereffect is present but slightly managed.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Legacy, care, and light amid darkness emerge organically through the tool’s use and the harbor’s transformation. Thematic lines are carried by event and image, with subtext in “protected vulnerability” and commerce made ethereal at night. A single explicit maxim via Jim about “what we need” brushes didacticism but stays character‑grounded. The ending’s glow reweights the opening’s loss (rose petal) without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres (control vs. coexistence; isolation transmuted into connection) and the sundial/hum motifs reweight at the end. However, several lines state thesis overtly (“Her motivation burned…”, “finally understood that her independence had been waiting within her all along”), reducing subtext. Emotional aftereffect is present but somewhat pre‑interpreted by the narrative. The strongest resonance arises from the no‑shadow sundial and mosaic‑of‑cracks acceptance image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Resonance emerges from particulars (lotus, rain, nest), but the theme is also stated directly (“the thread…was…mindful attention,” “everything was connected”), edging into explication. The final image is lovely, yet several lines summarize the thesis rather than letting it radiate from image and act. The “keeper of secrets” conceit pays off in the last beat but borders on tidy moral. More subtext and resisted clarity would deepen afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of manipulation, perception, and institutional denial arise from specific choices and images (alignments, back‑channel messages) rather than pure abstraction. Some lines edge toward expositional telling, but the final Charged Poise (preparing for the next phase) resonates without moralizing. Merrick’s late pivot hints at power reconfiguration, adding nuance. The aftereffect is thoughtful more than gut‑punch.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of defiance against engineered constraints and the redefinition of “key” (control vs. access) emerge through concrete actions and a final conceptual reweighting. Wistfulness about the surface complicates the rebellion, and the ending quietly answers with acceptance of a different freedom. No moralizing undercuts the resonance. A sharper echo of communal consequence could deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, seeing versus knowing, and communal amnesia are embedded in images (mask, mist) and Elena’s condition. However, the closing moral (“empathy never truly disappears”) states the thesis rather than letting images carry it, flattening subtext. The “unifying opposites” motif is told more than dramatized. Resonance is present but over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Reversible exile” resonates across reputation, climate, and the hidden system, with the nail as moral conduit. The final act reframes the ancestor’s disgrace into purpose, offering a thematic answer without a moral lecture. A few lines state theme directly (“might be reversible with the right knowledge and courage”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, image and action carry much of the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.7)
    Second chances, amnesty, and redemption recur through images (pixelation, bridge-between-worlds, map-wings) and are reweighted by the final ascent. Some lines tip into direct statement (“reshape reality through music, memory, and mercy”), flattening subtext. Still, the closing images offer a resonant, non-literal answer: belief becomes enactment. The glass flake and scaffold motifs carry thematic load effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of territory, borders, intention vs. theft, and legacy recur through images and choices. The closing realization reweights prior motifs, though it edges toward explicit statement. Subtext surfaces in object use and in Elias’s stance rather than speechifying, with a lingering, reflective aftereffect. Complexity is maintained without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of shared burdens and understanding dawning are coherent and echoed across telegram, stars, and final image. However, the piece often states its takeaways directly (“some knowledge was meant to be discovered not in isolation but together”), reducing subtext. The ending resonates gently but leans toward tidy moralizing rather than a layered, ambiguous charge. The daylily and dawn motifs do help frame the concept without overcomplication.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth vs. concealment and “uncover vs. reveal” cohere through mirrors, the lake, and the glamour. However, the text occasionally states its thesis (“Some truths must be uncovered, not revealed,” and the final moralizing sentences), softening subtext. The final image of identity-as-confession is strong and reweights prior motifs. Greater ambiguity around the mentor’s nature could have deepened resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    The images build toward a resonant idea of harmony between dream and waking, but the piece states the thesis explicitly (“Immediately, the visionary understood...”), undercutting subtext. Recurring motifs (scars, maze, cobalt light) do real thematic work and the final image reweights earlier material. Complexity exists (grounded yet expansive), but the moralizing line flattens ambiguity at the last beat. Strong concept, less mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Life‑from‑death and healing‑through‑cost recur through trees, bones, and the burned Tower reweighted by fire. Thematic links are earned by image and action more than statement, with “fierce gentleness” functioning as ethic and tactic. Some lines verge on overt thesis (“to patch holes in the soul”) but the final vigil image sustains resonance. Ambiguity remains humane rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of “after the applause” and purpose after loss emerge from concrete particulars—quarry voids, weave counts, Leeds echoes—rather than abstract lecture. Subtext in the “close to nothing…everything” line reframes value compellingly. The final realization edges toward explicitness (“discovering purpose after loss might still be possible”), softening the subtlety. Nonetheless, the images do most of the lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “transition” (matter/consciousness/lineage) emerges through recurrent images: the arbor, the seed, and the mentor’s departure. The ending reframes ambition as purpose and solitude as continuum without sermonizing. A few declarative lines flirt with abstraction, but they grow from specific particulars. The resonance lingers as a quiet promise charged with historical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of preserving wonder through embracing contradiction emerges organically from the ritual and setting, with the return-altered texts as a compelling emblem. However, it is also stated outright (“The key to maintaining the Great Collection was by accepting contradictions”), and the final moralizing tone (“adds another layer to who we might become tomorrow”) trims ambiguity. The images do much of the work; trimming thesis lines would heighten resonance. Still, the final synthesis reweights the premise credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres (fear walls vs. dissolving them; endings repriced as disconnection), and the final image reweights the opening. Subtext manifests in image (hush, light, absorption), yet explicit thesis lines (“the end of the world… a state of disconnection”) verge on moralizing, slightly reducing ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is sincere and resonant despite didactic edges. The motif set integrates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of diversion, buried currents, and earned forgiveness are integrated through concrete motifs (railway vs. river, medication vs. grief). The closing images offer resonance without needing explicit moral. However, a few overt thesis-like sentences (“The train lines, like her medication, had been a diversion…”) slightly blunt subtext. Overall, the motif web still reweights prior material effectively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence’s power and the ethics of unspoken truths arise organically from the setting and the watch’s reverse logic. However, explicit thesis lines (“teaching that some words gain power only in the absence of their speaking”) undercut subtext in the final third. The ending’s “secret to keep” offers a resonant answer, though it leans declarative over image-driven complexity. Overall, strong coherence with minor moralizing drag.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of preservation through propagation (not domination) emerges organically via the coffee omen, plant chorus, and the perforations becoming conduits. The final image—hollow trophy vs. living, cold bloom—reweights the premise without moralizing. “Perforated destiny” recodes damage as possibility, integrating concept, object, and choice. Resonance lingers through the mingled ache and quiet victory.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, ritual care, and redemption accrue organically through objects and action, with the “threshold of stillness” refracted rather than preached. The final image (adding the vial, watching for the next pattern) reweights the vocation’s burden and grace. Some lines lean toward direct statement of purpose, muting ambiguity. Still, the emotional afterimage is coherent and tender.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of rebirth and contentment recur through concrete images (hairpin etchings, scallop patterns) and culminate in a reweighted answer. However, several explicit statements (“This was the source of contentment…”) tip toward moralizing. The resonance is felt but somewhat told. Complexity exists but avoids sharper ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece coherently explores doubt as a companion to truth via concrete motifs (chimes, shard, dawn). Subtext lives in the “sincerely insincere” stance and the slip of the cloak. However, the final sentence states the theme explicitly (“doubt was not the enemy of truth, but its companion”), reducing resonance and inviting a mild sermonizing penalty. The images themselves nearly suffice without the overt moral.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ripple motif and unseen/seen dichotomy organically carry the theme. Yet several lines state the thesis outright (“Vanishing to appear wasn’t about physical disappearance...”), reducing subtext. The final image resonates, but the didactic articulation blunts complexity. More implication and fewer explanatory lines would heighten afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—journeys within stillness; harmonics as navigation; preparation as destiny—emerges through recurrent images (stones, echoes, birds) and is reweighted by the final disappearance. The line “movement was not always physical” edges toward on-the-nose statement, slightly dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the final charged poise (arrowhead as guide for the next) offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. Reverence toward history integrates with the ethic of caretaking and succession.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of presence versus automation emerge through images (lingering luminance, “brilliant dimness”) and the renunciation act. However, the text occasionally states its thesis too directly (“wonder couldn’t be programmed or standardized”), slightly dulling subtext. The final image (keystone’s glow across automated skies) is resonant and earned. Greater ambiguity or tension in the insight would add depth.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of perception, intention, and honoring the language of vibration emerge through image patterns (lanterns, glowing books, prismatic flames) and culminate in a resonant final image. The librarian’s exposition (“It’s something to acknowledge…”) veers toward didactic, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the protagonist’s vow translates insight into ethical commitment without a neat moral. The constellation of seekers offers a graceful conceptual repricing of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rebirth-through-contraction and fate versus interpretation recur in images (spiral, coins, prophecy), culminating in a conceptual answer (“folds inward to begin again”). However, several thematic lines are stated outright, edging toward thesis (“I need to wavelength align with the purpose of the universe”). The resonance is present but slightly didactic, with limited ambiguity or counter-pressure. The final image carries hope more than complex repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of naming as a humane reordering of fear resonates through concrete acts (Solitude, Lost Hope) rather than sermon. Sacrifice and memory thread subtly through the setting and Elara’s echoed lines. A couple of explicit lines (“legacy not of death but of understanding”) edge toward stating the thesis. The final image reweights earlier motifs with genuine emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of faith, attention, and “plausible impossibility” emerge through the water‑pattern method and the bell’s silence‑ring. The final image reweights “lukewarm” as virtue, though the closing lines tip toward explicit moralizing (“believing in something enough to see it through”). Subtext works best in the silence that wakes the sea. Overall resonance is strong but slightly instructed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs (silence, reflection, resurfacing) cohere into a meditation on memory, progress, and narrative justice, with a strong mirrored hush tone. The final image reweights prior material, but lines like “expunge the false narrative” and “spin silence into meaning” verge on stated thesis. Subtext operates in the chime’s silence and resurfacing roofs, though a bit more ambiguity would heighten resonance. Earnestness edges toward sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of fusing logic and intuition recur through concrete images (starlings’ geometry mirroring the crystal), yet the piece edges toward stated takeaway (“This was the touch of wonder…”). Resonance is present but tidy, with little ambiguity or counter‑pressure. The mentor memory adds a faint human undertow. The final image offers uplift more than reweighting with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of vigilance, trust, and revising beliefs under pressure accrue through recurring images (radio static, buckle) and the choice to “make the unbelievable seem inevitable.” A few explicit statements (“To preserve trust under pressure required…”) edge toward didactic, slightly flattening subtext. The end reframes duty as communication that compels trust, not demands it—a resonant, non‑literal answer. Greater reliance on image over assertion would deepen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Identity, autonomy, and non‑zero‑sum consciousness resonate through specific images (duplicate label, awakening brain). However, the final paragraph drifts into thesis (“consciousness was not zero‑sum… exponential”), edging into moralizing. The strongest thematic work arises earlier from the charged contrast between Maya’s numbness and the brain’s projected memories. The ending’s conceptual repricing lands but could trust the images more.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motifs (seed, brook, storm silence) support a coherent theme of rare growth through patience and orthogonal thinking. Yet the piece often states its thesis directly (“innovation flows not through predictable channels”), particularly in the final paragraph, reducing subtext. The resonance is present but edges toward sermonizing. The strongest meaning arises from the planting image, not the declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—grief’s resonance and absence as sanctuary—emerges from particulars: the hourglass, the echo architecture, and the lullaby‑wind method. The final reweighting (“he hadn’t restored the laughter; he’d merely remembered how it sounded”) lands without moralizing and retrofits prior images with bittersweet clarity. Subtext inhabits image and ritual rather than thesis. A couple of overt equivalences (“This wasn’t about clearing leaves…”) flirt with telling but don’t blunt the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core theme—befriending uncertainty as reality—coheres and recurs through light boundaries and waiting. Yet the text often states its thesis (“uncertainty was not a void…”) rather than letting images alone carry it, especially near the end, muting subtext. The final reweighting is resonant but edges toward moralizing. Strong integration; reduced subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of creative destruction emerges organically through action and the final reweighting. The thawed “frozen bloom” retools the central image with resonance. However, the concluding assertions (“not magic but evolution,” redefinition of “hopeless”) edge into moralizing and reduce subtext. Earlier imagery does the work better than these explicit statements.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Find the beginning in every ending” threads through objects and outcome, culminating in the city’s reawakening—an effective, non-literal answer. At times the piece states its thesis (“The practical approach…”) rather than letting image do the work, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the hush and resonance motifs accrue meaning toward closure. The conceptual repricing resonates without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of wholeness, fate, and chosen liminality cohere through recurring images (hourglass, moons, vanishing ferry) and the final “permanent transient” stance. Some lines overstate (“live more authentic lives”), blunting subtext. Still, the ending reweights prior images with a resonant conceptual answer: identity as union through costed liminality. The motifs integrate rather than checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of connection, shared unconscious, and “rational enchantment” resonate through recurring images and the final meeting with the sister. However, the line “connection wasn’t something to be discovered—it was something to be created” states the thesis too explicitly, dampening subtext. The ending reweights prior material, but the moral clarity reads tidy. Moments of implication (phantom figures dissolving) are strongest.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interconnection and “unfolded horizons” resonate through object, setting, and method, culminating in a reweighted final image. However, the theme is often stated outright (“Navigation isn’t just about direction”) rather than earned solely through scene pressure. The concluding speech edges toward moralizing even as it fits the tone. Still, the anchor’s reprise gives the theme concrete ballast.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of intergenerational warning, closure, and the dead aiding the living are integrated through object recurrence (photo, hearing aid). The final reframing of the photograph delivers resonance without overexplaining. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (“The dead call for reasons”) flatten subtext slightly. Overall, the piece invites reflection more than it dictates a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and liminal infrastructure (cables as afterlife conduits) emerge through image and action, not thesis. The “crashing hush” and the Codex’s closing “sigh” offer a resonant, quiet answer: service as sacred endurance. Occasional explicit lines (“Her motivation… had cost her…”) skim close to telling. Still, the final silence reweights prior images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of failure as transformation and systems turning dangerous emerge organically from the ink‑divination and reveal. However, explicit moralizing (“failure isn’t the end but a transformation”) blunts subtext. The porcelain shard/coffee reprise gestures toward human connection with resonance. Greater reliance on image over thesis would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of translation across senses, preservation versus superstition, and tool misread as curse emerge organically from events. The final repricing of the diamond’s “curse” is resonant without moralizing. Subtext about language as embodied texture threads through birds, fabrics, and bone towers. Slight tidiness in the triumphant ending trims lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of humility before the wild and “harmony untamed” are cohesive and recur through particulars (cryptids’ metamorphoses, lunar patterns, the charged arrowhead). Some lines articulate the thesis too directly (“true mission… to witness rather than capture”), slightly flattening subtext. The final image of luminous constellations and frostbitten hope still resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance emerges through recurring images (shell, tree, music) and the mechanized world versus wonder. Several lines state the thesis outright (“origin of beauty… suppressed,” “people began to dream again”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior material effectively, but moralizing edges intrude. The piece invites reflection but prefers statement over implication at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of hope as contraband and healing broken promises are carried by concrete acts (the handoff, the child’s imagined reaction) and weather imagery. Subtext works in the silence and procedural care; the bottle’s meaning reweights at the end. A few declaratives (“foster hope,” “glue that…made the pieces whole again”) veer toward stated moral. The resonance is warm and coherent but edges on tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silence as potential reconfigures from absence to generative force through events (the song animates the world), and the wind bell final image resonates. However, the explicit thematic statement (“silence... holds infinite possibility”) edges toward moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Most resonance arises from particulars—the music box, wind bells, fragment’s dissolution—rather than thesis. The piece invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The science/poetry synthesis yields a coherent theme about liminal spaces and living narratives, earned through concrete images (threads of text, analog memories). Some lines state the thesis too directly—“The place where stories live… ‘It’s the space between’”—slightly blunting subtext. The ending reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing beyond that moment. Emotional aftereffect is tender rather than overwhelming but lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—longing transmuted into a communicable language of light—emerges organically from images and process rather than thesis statements. Recurring motifs (dawn, palette, whispers) gain new meaning in the final repricing. A faint whiff of sentimentality appears in lines like “The answer is in the light,” but the piece largely earns its tenderness through concrete acts. The last beat invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of fear binding genius and small keys unlocking vast doors recur through ritual acts and the starlight thread. Some lines edge toward didactic (“ideas grow heavier when contained”), but they remain grounded in the scene’s action. The final dawn image reweights the premise without a spelled‑out moral. Subtext operates through object transformations rather than dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Folklore-as-memory, preservation vs. theft, and the reweighting of myth emerge organically from events and images (broken constellations, ring). However, late explicit statements (“folklore wasn’t just story…,” “The memory thieves hadn’t been cruel…”) lean toward thesis, softening subtext. The final image resonates but edges into moralizing summary. The conceptual repricing still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resilience, exile/return, and the persistence of shadow interlock through image and action; the archivist’s line “exile and return are the same movement” reframes the craft and mentorship. The shadow motif reweights meaning at the end as both endurance and cost. Occasional explicitness (“Like resilience, it endures…”) reduces subtlety but the closing promise (“how exile preserves what it removes”) resonates. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic throughline—art as preservation across visible/invisible realms—emerges through the heirloom, grandmother’s line, and the final guardianship stance. Subtext of lineage and sacrifice is present but occasionally edges toward declarative (“one must first surrender to it”). The ending reweights prior images (seed, hush, falls) for resonance. Complexity is moderate; little counter-pressure or moral friction to deepen the argument.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Restoration, secrecy, and the revaluation of silence emerge through the act of untying and the final stillness; motifs (mask, net, hush) meaningfully refract the theme. The ending reweights Elena’s attribute from burden to gift via action. However, “A secret isn’t meant to be kept forever” states the moral too directly, dampening subtext in the final paragraph. The piece otherwise trusts image and implication effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of secrecy, sacred experience, and the limits of cartography emerge organically from the work and the final act of honoring the threshold. The closing lines resonate, but they also state the thesis explicitly (“some knowledge exists not to be documented, but to be felt”), muting subtext. Recurring images (rain, frescoes, the tear) support the conceptual turn. Emotional aftereffect is quiet and sincere rather than didactic, despite the on‑the‑nose phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic throughline—frequency/pressure/letting go—emerges organically via object and setting, culminating in the reweighted “home.” However, explicit statements (“death wasn’t an ending but a frequency shift”) verge on telling, dulling subtext. The final image still resonates, but some moralizing trims altitude. The best moments are imagistic (water as barrier, plane’s disappearance).

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of translation, loneliness, and cross‑realm empathy emerge organically from particulars (graffiti as code, plate as conduit). The final harmonized “silent song” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without sermonizing. Some beats state rather than subtext (e.g., childhood backstory laid out), slightly reducing complexity. Overall, the imagery carries the thematic weight well.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Light, lenses, and altitude mesh with the theme of finding joy beneath duty’s anguish, and the final act embodies affectionate detachment without melodrama. Some lines edge into stated moral (“affirmed her belief…”) which dilutes subtext. The closing image still reweights prior material effectively. The thematic aftertaste lingers but could trust implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, connection, and “absence preserving presence” emerge through image and ritualized observation. The telescope’s reprise and the mirrored cloud pattern create resonance. However, the text sometimes states the thesis directly (“Empty spaces did remember; the sky was a living archive”), dulling subtext. The ending still offers a felt, non‑literal answer through image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—essence vs. appearance, seeing through pattern rather than face—is integrated through concrete acts (tracing coin, impressions on walls). The final reframing from sky to human constellations offers a resonant non-literal answer. A few lines edge toward overt thesis (“patterns of their souls,” “what the Scholars had intended all along”), softening subtlety. Nonetheless, the closing image carries emotional and conceptual aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of pattern, connection, and harnessing natural phenomena emerge through recurring images (murmurations/light/hopscotch). Subtext is modest; the piece leans on direct assertions like “What he had discovered was astounding,” which weakens resonance. The final shift reframes cartography as mapping luminous pathways, but the insight is told more than earned in a felt dilemma. A richer price or contradiction would deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of restoration over acquisition, empathy as method, and lineage/belonging accrue naturally via recurring images (mirrors, heart, tools). The final images (ancestors in reflections, synchronized heartbeat) resonate. A line explicitly states the moral (“not to claim something new, but to restore”), which blunts subtext. Still, the closing reweights the premise with gentle grace.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of communal trust, intergenerational stewardship, and cooperation across life/death cohere through recurring images (chalk script, arches, bell). The ending resonates conceptually—communal rituals and gratitude—but it leans on declarative summation that flirts with moralizing (“had saved them all”). Subtext is present but low‑tension; complexity is modest. The “brambled hope” motif is evocative but asserted more than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of quiet resistance, the necessity of imperfection, and endurance over annihilation emerge organically through the flawed puppet head and lullaby. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: a vouchsafed hush and sentinel beam rather than triumph. No didactic moralizing; the images carry the meaning. Ambiguity lingers productively about how long the reprieve lasts.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of transforming curse into service and reframing duty as purpose emerge organically from events, with the spent nut and dawn return offering a resonant answer. Some lines state the moral plainly (“turn a curse into a blessing”), dulling subtext that the images could carry alone. The orchard’s reweighting against his acceptance is effective and lingers. Greater ambiguity around the cost or the birds’ continuing threat could deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Recurring images (braids, foam, chrysalis, harmony) develop connection vs. separation with a resonant final repricing. Some lines voice the thesis directly (“I’ve been so focused...”); the piece flirts with on‑the‑nose moral but mostly earns its insights through particulars. The chrysalis’s re‑reading at the end is effective. The result invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of absence, beginnings in silence, and ethical creation are integrated through bottled moonlight, shards, and parole. The final insight coheres with prior images, but it is stated directly (“stories began not in some mythical place…”) which blunts subtext. The door as a reconfigured threshold offers resonance beyond the summary statement. Overall strong, if slightly told.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Craft as an ethic of reworking pain (sandpapering remorse) integrates with the chef premise and the pavilion’s function. The sturdy/brittle motif accrues meaning from fortress walls to emotional states to the pavilion architecture, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. A couple of declarative statements (“His motivation was simple yet profound”) edge toward telling. The ending invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of reconnection via shared time, language, and labor coheres, with the weight’s re‑chaining offering a neat metaphor. Subtext exists in the shift from disused silos to bridges, but it leans tidy and lightly sentimental. The piece resists overt moralizing, though the conclusions feel predetermined. The final image conceptually reprices “time” as communal rhythm, if without lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant motifs (broken mirror, spirals, archaeology of dreams) align with a theme of purpose found in imperfection and communal memory. However, several lines tip into thesis‑statement territory (“modified the very relationship between abandonment and rediscovery”), blunting subtext. The final image conceptually reprices the mirror and purpose. Thematic complexity is present but somewhat over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stewardship across generations and the triad of water/moonlight/memory coherently express vigilance as a living system. The final image reweights the manuscript doodle and the duty motif without sermonizing. Some thematic lines are told plainly (“renewed protections,” “coming darkness”), limiting subtext. Still, the intergenerational cadence gives the ending quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, loss, and art as empathy arise from particulars (stress‑crack “notation,” the First Singer legend, Master Kaelen’s gift) without sermonizing. “Empathy in motion” is dramatized rather than declared. The end reframes silence as a medium that can be translated, not an absence. Complexity is present but not sharply contested by counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of humility, partnership with nature, and silence as knowledge arise organically from repeated motifs. The closing reprices sacrifice into acknowledgment with resonant imagery. A few lines state the thesis too explicitly (“not sacrifice but acknowledgment”), slightly flattening subtext. Nonetheless, the afterimage is cohesive and reflective without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of empathy as resonance is organically tied to method and the fireworks parallel, yielding a satisfying reweighting at the end. Some lines border on thesis (“Empathy is the bridge…”) and nudge toward didacticism. The final image earns reflection but edges close to a stated moral in the last turn. Subtext operates best in the sensory build rather than the explicit claims.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of listening to an undercurrent of wisdom via lineage and practice coheres through recurring images (scent, doodles, hush). However, explicit statements like “I’ve learned to listen… to the undercurrent of wisdom” edge toward moralizing, reducing subtext. The final image reaffirms belonging and stewardship but risks neatness. Resonance lingers more through image than argument.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Resilience/adaptation is thematically coherent and binds planet mechanics, occupation, and object. However, the piece leans on declarative insight (“They whispered secrets…”) instead of letting subtext do the heaviest lift. The final resonance is hopeful but tidy. Complexity and moral charge remain mild.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Emergent themes of systems convergence, foresight, and the human trace (the patch) accrue through image and method. The final reweighting toward “affecting both mind and matter” broadens the moral horizon without over‑explaining. Some theme statements are told rather than dramatized (“to cultivate foresight in action”), slightly blunting resonance. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a sharper countercurrent or paradox at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres: silence as presence, wonder as essential, art as public good. The closing lines verge on declarative moral (“proving irrefutably… essential”), which blunts subtext. Best resonance is in images—the lotus‑like hush—rather than thesis statements. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t embrace much ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of renouncing mastery for healing emerges through particulars (echoing mountains, glowing markers, returning driftwood). However, the final paragraph edges into overt moralizing (“To harvest insights from failure…”) that states what the images have shown. Subtext is present but occasionally overridden by explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of quantifying emotion vs. ethical trespass emerge through image (halo, stars) and action (borrowing personality). Some lines tip into didactic assertion (“feeling was merely information”), softening subtext. The final image reweights the premise but also states a thesis too plainly. Resonance lingers, if a touch over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of wonder emerging from routine and stewardship across generations resonate through recurring images and the final act. However, the closing aphorism states the moral explicitly (“wonder wasn’t delivered… it was awakened”), blunting subtext. The pendant’s reweighting from object to communal catalyst mostly carries the load. Emotional aftereffect is warm but edges into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of science vs. mysticism, memory as residue, and “truthful lies” emerge through concrete images (frost designs, quartz glow) rather than sermonizing. The final repricing widens the inquiry without forcing a tidy moral. Some lines state thesis-like frames (“truthful lies,” “life’s work had just begun anew”), slightly flattening subtext. The afterimage is nonetheless resonant and open.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (silence as presence, amber, weaving) cohere and the final image reweights them. Yet the explicit thematic statement—“silence is not absence…”—reads as moralizing and reduces subtext in the final movement. The work has genuine resonance through image and cost; it didn’t need the thesis line. The concept otherwise integrates cleanly with character action.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of resilience and transformation accrue through image (silk, shards, arches) and the smith’s choice. The line “true resilience wasn’t about avoiding brokenness…” states the moral outright, undercutting subtext in the final third. Still, the ending image of travelers sensing the echo has lingering resonance. Complexity is modest; ambiguity is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of secrecy, gatekeeping, and the ethical weight of knowledge surface through action (Archive prohibitions, shard’s protective refusal). Recurring images (shard warmth/dimming; alternating versions of the bay) accrue resonance and reweight the ending toward persistence over revelation. Occasional direct question lines verge on expository (“What importance did this hidden knowledge carry…”), diluting subtext. The closing image avoids a tidy moral while leaving a felt conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: silence as fellowship, lineage as shelter, objects as vows. The final acts (stone added, letter written, sea glass returned) provide a non‑literal answer about belonging and guardianship. Occasional near‑moralizing (“a beacon for ships and souls alike”) brushes the on‑the‑nose, but the closing reprices the premise with earned resonance. The ache of loneliness converted to kinship lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of rediscovery after collapse and marrying ancient intuition to tech emerge organically through objects and ritual. “Shadowed elation” becomes a thematic stance, not just mood. Occasional telling (“reckless rush into convenience”) softens subtext. The final image coheres without sermonizing but remains relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around perspective, protection, and iridescence—seeing and being seen at angles. The blue morpho reprises with reweighted meaning, and the donor heart links perception to empathy. A line like “people magnetize stories not through volume…” edges toward spelled-out thesis, muting subtext. Still, the ending image (tea, color-shifting petals, adaptive storytelling) resonates beyond a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of endurance, witness, and revaluation of sorrow emerge organically from tools and work; the trees’ perspective elegantly reweights prior images. However, the text tips into stated moral (“sorrow as simply part of growth”) and explanatory framing (“The mundane miracle was clear”), muting subtext. The final sanctuary reframing resonates but edges toward told insight over purely imaged answer. The emotional after‑effect is calm and contemplative rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around memory as social fabric and restoration through recognition. Several lines state the thesis directly (“weren’t mere melodies but the very fabric of social bonds”), which flattens subtext. Still, the final image of a woven dawn that rekindles communal bonds is resonant. Stronger implication and fewer declarations would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme is clear—accepting contradictions over conforming—but it’s stated directly multiple times (“the beauty of contradictions,” “wisdom… accepting our contradictions”). The final paragraphs veer into moralizing rather than letting images carry resonance. The invitation‑as‑bookmark is a strong image that could bear more subtext with fewer declarations. Earned insight does land but feels over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of slow decay, care as resistance, and sacredness in ordinary acts accrue through bread, gardening, and the tea ritual. The final act reweights earlier details (bread shifting to forgiveness) without overt moralizing. A few explicit lines (“I’m here to uncloak the truth”) lean declarative, but subtext generally carries the weight. Resonance lingers in the offering she leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of preservation, duty, and meaning in the face of oblivion emerge organically from the work and tools. The final image reweights earlier motifs with quiet hope rather than a neat moral. A touch of direct statement (“conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”) edges toward thesis language, softening subtext. Nonetheless, the luminous vows function as both stake and thematic carrier.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Trust, silence, and betrayal cohere through the “silence that screams” motif, reweighted effectively at the climax. The truce of hush becomes thematic as well as procedural, avoiding overt moralizing. Resonance lingers in the notion of collecting imperceptible moments. Some thematic complexity is left on the table given Eliza’s minimal inner cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of symbiosis, communal choice (“Forest Elections”), and inherited responsibility accrue through objects and images rather than moralizing. One explicit line (“It’s a symbiosis”) edges toward stating the thesis, but the closing image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. “Futuristic nostalgia” coheres with the intergenerational ring and ancient‑new technology frame. The piece invites reflection on agency within ecological systems without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of authenticity vs. approval and memory as both gift and burden emerge through concrete images (charcoal fingers, hidden panel, cave light unveiling blues). However, the text sometimes states its thesis (“You paint what others want…”, “uncork suppressed creativity”) rather than letting subtext do the work. The final image reweights earlier motifs effectively. Emotional resonance is present, though shaded toward the declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of truth, preservation, and the moral calculus of candor are integrated through specific images (curing gold scripts, candor‑safe routes). The ending offers a resonant stance—authenticity as the only viable method—yet edges into explicit moralizing (“She finally understood...”), reducing subtext. The lost‑conversation aim and departed love lend poignancy without sentimentality. A touch more implication over statement would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of language beyond words, the ethics of attention, and devotion translating into communal meaning emerge organically through object and ritual. The final unprecedented spectrum reweights the premise—wonder preserved at the price of a life—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant, even if complexity is more conceptual than psychologically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from concrete acts: fear repurposed as fuel, wholeness through fragmentation, machine-organic synthesis. The final image (empty box beginning to glow; rooted miniatures) reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. A few lines verge on statement (“born of necessity and sacrifice”) but do not overwhelm subtext. Resonance lingers through the cost and reconfiguration rather than a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme coheres—listening as communal repair—and the letters offer a resonant, image‑based answer. However, explicit moralizing (“Leo decided to prove that listening heals”) blunts subtext. The ending’s communal window tableau carries genuine warmth without collapsing into pure sentimentality. Complexity is present but safe, with little counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Symbols (dice, dance, web) align to a theme of vulnerability repurposed as strength, culminating in a conceptual repricing. However, explicit thesis statements—“vulnerability encrypted properly becomes unbreakable strength”—flatten subtext and feel didactic. The ending’s resonance exists, but it’s told rather than discovered. A quieter image in place of overt moralizing would deepen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of memory persistence, transformation, and stewardship emerge organically via rituals and the whale/cystal pairing. The final realization reweights prior images, but the line “nothing was ever truly lost, only transformed” edges toward stated moral. Subtext lives in the reburial and marked spot—a keeper’s ethic rather than ownership. A touch less explicit philosophizing would intensify resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of containment versus contagion, and peace as active transformation, emerge through action (mapping silence, transmuting code). The final image of the crane drifting into dissolution offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Some phrasing edges toward overt symbolism (“terrestrially cosmic accomplishment”), but subtext mostly rides image and ritual logic. The recurrence of silence and water accrues meaning credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of inheritance, memory embedded in architecture, and protective falsehoods emerge organically from events and the charged object. Some explicit statements (“It’s inheritance”) border on telling the thesis rather than letting subtext fully carry it. The final image reweights prior details without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, though complexity is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of skepticism versus mystery and isolation into independence emerge organically through repeated images (shell, crystals, last star) and the archivist role. The ending reweights prior material without needing an explained moral. However, a few lines name the thesis too directly (“translated isolation into independence”), slightly flattening subtext. The conceptual burden of guardianship resonates, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of lineage, guilt, and renewal arise organically through the thorn/key/decree triad. The addendum and planting intention reweight heritage with a credible emotional aftertaste. Some lines veer toward moralizing (“some keys open not doors, but hearts”), dulling subtext. Overall resonance lingers without needing expository statements.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Compassion over force, letting go versus echoing, and earned transformation cohere through images (song, shell, light). The final reweighting (bittersweet acceptance) lands, but the line “She had learned why some people echo” edges toward explicit thesis, slightly blunting subtext. Recurring motifs evolve meaningfully (shell’s silence, melancholy softening). Thematic complexity is present, if more stated than implied at one key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth, repair, and intergenerational reckoning emerge coherently through the conduit motif and the captain’s release. The snow globe’s reweighted meaning works as thematic engine. However, several lines state the thesis (“the most powerful truths...”), shading into moralizing and reducing subtext. The resonance remains, but some subtlety is traded for articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (nets/knots, fireflies, moon paths, tea whisk) coherently embody the theme of unseen labor and impermanence. However, explicit moralizing (“This appreciation… was the highest form of wisdom”) undercuts subtext in the final third. The ending image still resonates, but the stated thesis blunts ambiguity. The thematic architecture is elegant but a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth vs. control, transformation of poison into life, and the ethics of secrecy cohere through images (flawed diamond, stillpoint, orchard thriving). Subtext arises in the reweighting of her debunker role into keeper/resistance, but the ending leans into overt moralizing (“Hope was the one thing…”) that blunts resonance. The conceptual repricing lands, if a bit declared. A slightly quieter, image‑led last beat would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: truth in static over spectacle, science/faith interpenetration, and fidelity to pattern over power. Recurring images (portico, storms, fragments) evolve to a final stance that reweights meaning without moralizing. A few aphoristic lines teeter on thesis‑statement, but they remain character‑voiced and supported by particulars. The ending’s quiet resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of intergenerational connection via sensory memory emerges organically through objects and action; the ending reweights earlier images. Some lines tilt toward statement (“He believed... This was gleaned redemption”), edging into didactic clarity. The resonance lingers, but complexity and ambiguity are moderate. Quietly moving without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of inherited duty integrating the mechanical and mystical (“fleshly ethereal”) emerges organically via objects and action. The final vow reweights the opening and offers a resonant, if tidy, answer: stewardship sustained through knowledge and feeling. Subtext of science as ritual glimmers in vibrational matching; however, ambiguity and moral cost are soft. The ending’s serenity slightly undercuts lingering complication.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—unyoking from urgency through celestial attention—and motifs recur (moon paths, mirror lake, restrained wildness). Some lines slide toward moralizing (“humanity’s greatest achievement”) rather than letting images carry the weight. The final cadence reweights prior images but avoids deep ambiguity or counter‑pressure. Resonance is present yet declared more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of liberation, legacy, and institutional control are organically threaded through the lantern and ancestry links. The final image reweights the motif, but explicit statements (“The lantern’s light… now it would illuminate her path”) verge on thesis. Subtext exists in the historical echo but is partially overwritten by summary lines. Complexity is present but slightly tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of penance, repair vs. reminder, and justice reweighted through mercy emerge through image and choice. The clockwork heart’s silence as moral anchor is strong, but explicit thesis lines (“Sometimes broken things should remain broken”; “The heart stopped because justice had been served…”) edge into moralizing. Subtext otherwise works via charged objects and restraint. The final image lingers without telling us what to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of pursuit, solitude, and the value of unseen achievement accrue through objects and images rather than moralizing. The final vibration/sea‑pause reweights the premise with quiet resonance. Some repetition (“yearning algorithm,” “steadily curious”) edges toward telling, dulling subtextive depth. Still, the bell’s unheard note offers an earned, reflective answer.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Memory, erasure, and institutional power accrue through particulars (deleted files “go everywhere,” the archive as both reliquary and weapon). The Stellaris patch and the 731 motif reweight meaning at the end. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (“ensure that nothing… could successfully delete the truth forever”) skim toward moralizing. Still, the final repricing of “deletion” into dispersion lands.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “empathy into action” theme aligns with the chosen method and outcome, and the mirrors/time-fragments motif binds concept to image. However, the piece states its thesis multiple times (“mapping empathy onto action”), edging into on-the-nose moralizing. Subtext is less active because elders and communal stakes remain offstage. The final image resonates but avoids complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring images (ice breaking, wind, the parasol tip) develop a coherent theme of endings as beginnings. The “melting ice” line lands as an image-driven thesis more than a declaration, and the final choice reweights the premise effectively. However, occasional explicit moralizing (“Change doesn’t always mean loss”) and label statements dilute subtext. Still, the aftertaste is resonant and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres: destined mismatches as learning, connection as space between people, incomplete things retaining value. The recurrent objects/images shift weight at the end. At times the prose states its thesis (“Destined mismatches were not failures but opportunities…”) rather than letting scene carry it, blunting subtext. Still, the final reframing has resonance without moral over-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around preservation, liminality, and the cost of stewardship, with recurring images (edges, echoes, parapet) carrying resonance into the final image. Some lines over‑articulate the thesis (“Such was the nature of their calling”), blunting subtext. Still, the ending reweights prior material with a quiet, durable charge.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of renewal, connection, and reframing pain are clear and reinforced by recurring images (vines, arcs, factory). Some lines slide into thesis-stating (“This was the essence of collective healing”), softening subtext. The final image resonates but doesn’t reprice the premise with a new cost. Emotional honesty holds, if a touch sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance is strong, but overt thesis statements (“language never dies—it transforms”) flatten subtext and edge toward sermonizing. The best thematic work arises from particulars—the hush, dust like spirits, and the tone as revelation. The ending’s repricing is clear yet told heavily, reducing ambiguity and lingering tension. Still, the piece invites reflection on preservation vs. transformation with some grace.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of time’s passage versus memory’s erosion is carried through object use and sound-image rather than lectures. The final image reweights earlier motifs (arrows, chalk, echoes) into a quiet acceptance, avoiding tidy moralizing. A few lines state concepts directly (“the sound of growing older”), but the scene’s particulars keep it honest. The caretaker’s lineage adds an intergenerational echo that enriches the repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme (resonance over force; escape velocity as perceptual transcendence) emerges from objects and choices, but the text occasionally states its thesis (“It’s not escape velocity in the physical sense”). The luminous-ache register yields a resonant final image of unseen phenomena. Subtext operates through the clock’s reweighting. Slight moralizing tones reduce subtlety at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motifs (fragment → wholeness, scent → hope, hymning the mundane) braid into a coherent meditation on reunification and meaning over miracle. Subtext carries through action—the shard becomes a reliquary, the music reframes denial—though a few lines nudge toward thesis statement. The ending’s image reweights prior particulars without explaining them. Emotional honesty largely avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of knowledge, fracture, and liminal paths surface through concrete actions (closing loops to “relearn”). The final realization about shadows reweights prior images, though the line “They go nowhere and everywhere” leans declarative. The “journey beginning” cadence lands, if a touch programmatic. Subtext exists in the observatory becoming a beacon, but explicit articulation occasionally undercuts resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (“mistakes into constellations,” bone setting across realms, the tooth’s light) braid into a coherent meditation on forgiveness vs. certainty. The final image reweights prior material with quiet resonance. However, “forgiveness was more powerful than skepticism” reads as an explicit thesis, dulling subtext. When the piece trusts image (tooth dissolving, hands joining), it soars.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around gentle illumination versus destructive fire, patience, and transforming limitation into a conduit for connection. Recurring images (sea glass, starlight, grotto walls) gather meaning toward the ending’s reframing of “earthbound” as vantage rather than shackle. A few declaratives (“She realized… knew she had found her purpose”) edge toward telling, but the scene earns much of it through particulars. The emotional aftereffect is quiet and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of truth, legacy, and transformation emerge through recurring particulars (spiral, moss, pendant). The final image reweights prior material without a mechanical moral, though lines like “ethical science could emerge” and “healing began when…” verge on didactic. Subtext largely operates in image and setting rather than pronouncement. Resonance is strong despite slight over‑statement.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Recurring images (shell, mist, “against the current,” cameos) braid into a coherent theme of broken/completion and transformed hope. However, the piece sometimes states its thesis outright (“I will solemnize... the essence of human resilience”), edging into on-the-nose. The final repricing—broken and complete—lands with resonance. Subtext exists but is occasionally overshadowed by declaratives.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around cultural memory, stewardship, and cyclical renewal, emerging from concrete images (vine, songs, harvest moon) rather than didactic assertion. The final hush and cyclical promise reweight the opening images effectively. Complexity is present but gentle; ambiguity about future costs remains mostly conceptual. The piece avoids platitudes but doesn’t push toward a thornier moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (heartbeat, discarded orchard matter, starlight) cohere into a theme of patience as salvation and “moving stillness.” The final glow reweights earlier particulars effectively. However, lines like “This was the essence of moving stillness” state the thesis, reducing subtext. Resonance lingers but edges toward summary in places.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—how wonder endures when given structure—emerges through locksmith craft, reflection geometry, and the final charged image. The “cellar of reason” articulation skirts didactic but is grounded by process. The ending reweights prior images (light, marble, prisms) into communal continuity without a tidy moral. Ambiguity around the “wounded season” adds resonance without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, geology, and the ethics of bearing and measuring burdens arise through concrete ritual acts. The final repricing of “trapped” into “connected” resonates with prior particulars (starlight, calcification, ledger). A couple of lines verge on thesis (“Every weight must be measured…”), but the imagery carries the argument. The ending lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of presence/absence and “holding differently” accrue through particular images (mane, kettle’s clock, rain constellations) and reweight at the end. Subtext runs chiefly in object work and selection, not dialogue. One line edges toward thesis (“not the lesson of letting go, but of holding differently”), slightly reducing the feltness in favor of statement. Nonetheless, the final image resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of eroded ambition, self‑reconciliation, and the power of communal stories accrue through concrete images (bridge made of others’ words) rather than moralizing. The ending’s reconfiguration (carousel turning, currents aligned) offers a resonant answer about integration over return. The ghost’s “recognition—perhaps even forgiveness” lands as earned rather than declared. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what future this integration yields), inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The navigation/hope linkage embodied by the sextant and revived lights offers a tidy, resonant answer to the story’s question. That said, the theme is sometimes told (“equations for hope,” “maze of intentions”) rather than fully earned through subtext. The final conceptual repricing is satisfying but a touch declarative. Still, the image‑driven close lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Renewal vs. time’s wounds emerges organically through objects and sound; the watch and crystals reweight past and future. However, the line about the bear seeming to say “It is never too late” tips into explicit thesis, softening subtext. Otherwise, the final image reframes timekeeping as memory‑keeping without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, but it flirts with sentimentality at that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around truth as perspective (sundial metaphor) and institutional deception. However, explicit thesis language (“architecture of lies,” “train others to see beyond constructed narratives”) verges on moralizing. Resonance exists but subtext is often stated rather than implied. The final image reweights earlier motifs without a fresh turn of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of patience, listening, and craft as language emerge organically from rope work and the fulgurite’s transformation. The “knots are their language” line edges toward telling but is grounded by demonstration. The closing reweights the premise (fog parting/path forward) without moralizing. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of absence → presence and wound → path emerges through recurring objects and actions, not merely assertion. The thread’s shift from “anchor/burden” to “compass” reweights the whole. Some lines state thesis a touch on‑the‑nose (“mapping the geography of healing”), tempering subtlety. The final image invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonance grows from particulars (egg, transformation, scent) and the final resolve reframes “beauty” as organic rather than engineered. However, explicit theme statements (“true beauty couldn’t be assembled…”) verge on moralizing and dilute subtext. The ending still offers a conceptual repricing with cost, even if spelled out. Strong images do much of the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of transformation, inheritance, and the beauty of scars emerge organically via grafting and the repurposed black sand. The coin and lagoon help subtextualize legacy and chosen identity. Repetition of “Scars can sing” veers into thesis articulation, reducing subtlety in the final stretch. Despite that, the closing image reweights prior particulars with honest feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Memory, liberation, and patience accrue through recurring images (geese pause, starlight breadcrumbs, thawed fountains), and the final reconfiguration reweights the city’s silence as potential. A few lines verge on declarative thesis (“luminous skepticism had been replaced by certainty”), trimming subtext. Still, the last image—water reflecting constellations—earns a quiet resonance. Thematic integration is solid if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (gear approximating infinity, generational spirals, petals) cohere around non-destructive illumination and cultural cycles. The ending reweights the premise via hope of breaking patterns—resonant if gentle. Some thematic statements are told rather than earned (“Some had flourished… others had recoiled”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the conceptual spine is consistent and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres through objects and pattern-recognition (butterflies, ribbon knots, poems) reweighting grief as communal craft. The final tableau resonates, but the mentor’s articulated thesis (“What we carry together...”) states the moral, dulling subtext. Still, the imagery-driven repricing of grief’s shape is earned by the process depicted. Subtext operates well in the act of carving and the family ritual without over-explaining until the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of shared stewardship and balance emerge organically from actions, but they’re also stated outright via inscriptions and final declarations (“We are all time-keepers now”). The piece achieves genuine warmth and earned repricing, yet leans into moralizing in the last paragraph, reducing ambiguity. Strong symbolic braid (bob/handle/clock) supports resonance despite didactic edges. A subtler finish would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of love’s persistence and death as transformation arises through objects and process (threads, echoes, the melody like water). The late repricing from romance to sacrifice adds moral complexity without neat moralizing. However, the explicit line “love... was the most persistent echo of all” veers toward statement over resonance, slightly dulling subtext. The charged re-reading of “gloom” to “protective” is the stronger thematic move.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of innovation within constraint and the ethics of prediction emerge coherently from her practice and the community’s reliance. Some lines drift into thesis‑speak (“Her purpose was clear: to write the future”), reducing subtext. The final image reaffirms transformation and stewardship but avoids a reweighting with palpable cost. Resonance lingers, if quietly, more as affirmation than reconsideration.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—stories as lifeblood and resistance—emerges through particulars (radio, dust, famine) rather than sermonizing. The dust mechanic bridges idea and action, creating resonant subtext about memory, residue, and voice. The ending image offers a non‑literal answer (quiet revolution persists) without a moral. Slight explanatory heaviness around the dust science trims the mystery a touch.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres through recurring images (ash rebirth, porcelain fractures, vanishing point illusions), and the ending reframes completion as a false refuge. Subtext arises from process imagery and materials that reveal/conceal. However, lines like “Somber marvel—wasn’t that the essence of human experience” and “the mirage of safety” verge on overt thesising, trimming subtlety. The resonance remains strong despite occasional explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—memory vs. mandated forgetting, reverence for method vs. fear of hubris—emerges organically through the artifact and setting. The cog’s reprise gives the ending conceptual resonance. Some lines edge toward thesis (“They condemn what they don’t understand,” “for what was wisdom…”) which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the last image quietly reweights prior material without a hard moral.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres—harmony through subtraction, listening, and continuity—but it’s often stated outright (“music builds bridges,” “doesn’t eliminate diversity; it elevates it”). Subtext resides in the rosette’s reprise and the quiet of the library, which carry some resonance. Moralizing edges in near the end, tempering ambiguity. Still, the final gift image offers a non‑literal answer that reweights the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant images (seeds not stones; beauty from ruins) integrate theme with action. The ending reweights the premise through a charged poise: small acts of reconnection can be revolutionary. Some lines verge on direct moralizing (“This was his gentle rebellion… what mattered most”), dulling subtext. Still, the motif work and sensory memory thread provide genuine aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around truth, dependence on systems, and preserving wonder; the bees’ return reweights prior material without heavy-handedness. The supervisor’s line risks didacticism but is cushioned by Elara’s reframing (“Not sabotage—despair.”). The ending offers a quiet, resonant answer through image. More subtext in their exchange could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—love’s residue animates place—emerges via objects and ritual, then reweights at the glow. However, the final paragraph states the thesis too baldly (“life lingers where love leaves its traces”), softening subtext. The shard’s “inadvertently profound” nature enriches the idea of presence as echo. Resonance lingers, but moralizing tempers the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece pursues a coherent theme about certainty versus nuance and lands a resonant conceptual shift. However, overt thesis statements (“The truth is not a single thread but a tapestry,” “no truth is absolute”) introduce didactic echo, especially late. Subtext exists in imagery but is often overwritten by explicit articulation. The emotional aftertaste is thoughtful yet a bit sermonized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of chance vs. determinism and imperfection breaking perfection (chipped die defeats perpetual motion) integrate well with plot. The final image reweights earlier motifs without an explicit moral. A few on‑the‑nose declarations (“If the staircase is infinite, then it must contain infinite possibilities”) soften subtext. Overall, resonance is solid and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, language, and transhistorical kindness are woven through objects and images (brush, symbols, moonlight). However, the piece states its thesis explicitly (“kindness was humanity’s oldest language”), especially in the closing, edging into sermonizing and reducing resonance. Subtext exists in the tactile ritual of art-making, but asserted universals occasionally outpace scene pressure. The final image carries warmth, yet could trust implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, identity, and collective survival emerge through objects and acts (bread initials, emerald lens) rather than stated moral. The final image reweights earlier motifs—green resilience piercing dread—without sermonizing. “The bread remembers” risks overt thesis, but it’s earned by the scene’s craft detail. Ambiguity lingers productively around the bees’ role and the durability of revival.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme (defiance of fate and time as choice) is coherent and supported by recurring images (counter‑clockwise, tide, yoyo), culminating in a reweighted world. However, the text states thesis‑like lines (“time was not a river... but a choice”), reducing subtext. The final image resonates conceptually but skirts sentimentality in its triumphal certainty. Strong integration, modestly dinged for overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme is coherent—transformation through paradox; fear’s power as illusion—and objects/images reprise well. However, it leans on explicit thesis statements (“Your weakness is your strength; your curse is your blessing,” “It clings to the illusion…”) that flatten subtext. The final recognition works conceptually but risks sermonizing rather than letting images carry the weight. More implication and embodied consequence would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of transmutation—obstacles into instruments, art as survival—arise organically through method and setting. Some lines near moralize (“In this method of instrumental transformation, the prophet found her purpose”), blunting subtlety. The final image of ongoing resonance effectively reframes struggle as cyclical craft rather than conquest. Resonance lingers, if not deeply destabilizing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: misread patterns, watchers as guardians, duty replacing curiosity. The final image reweights earlier “sunwashed dread” into chosen burden without overt moralizing. Some thematic statements are told plainly via the journal (“terrible truth”), reducing subtext. Nonetheless, the pattern language/whistle motif earns resonance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of “noble lies” versus justice surface clearly through concrete findings (compensation ledger, erased names). However, several explicit statements (“perfect metaphor,” “truth would flourish”) tilt toward moralizing rather than subtext. The final image rescales the history, but subtlety would heighten resonance. Still, the particulars meaningfully carry the argument.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance accrues through motifs (inkwell, drawbridge, preservation) to a quiet cadence of duty and witness. However, theme is sometimes told (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) rather than earned solely through image, softening subtext. The ending’s conceptual repricing—measuring dreams like shores—lands with grace. Overall moving, slightly on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of origins and continuity accrues through objects and setting (stamp, shadows, archives), culminating in a reweighted self‑understanding. However, the piece undercuts subtext with explicit moralizing—“what all truly honest origins reveal—that we are never as separate from history as we might believe”—which states the thesis instead of letting the image carry it. The motif reprises are apt but occasionally feel signaled rather than earned. Resonance lingers, but the sermonizing trims its edge.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of transmuting grief into guiding light is earned through concrete craft and the basilica’s function as a communal dream-vault. The paradox of descending while ascending reweights the final image without didactic moralizing. The last beat reframes torment as a beacon, offering resonance beyond plot. Subtext arises from images (cranes as hope/weight) rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of grief transmuted into purpose and the ethics of harvesting “lost possibilities” emerge coherently through image (pool of liquid light) and action. However, overt statements (“It now contained the hopes and dreams...”) edge into telling, dampening subtext. The final repricing—Elias redefining himself and envisioning a path for humanity—resonates but avoids thornier costs. Ambiguity about moral consequence is raised but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of belonging, alignment, and recognition are woven through recurring images (star trails, missing pieces, brilliant dimness) and reweighted at the end. The pilgrim’s dictum risks didacticism but is paid off by the closing image rather than a moral. The final realization feels earned and lingers conceptually. Slight neatness and stated wisdom curb complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and earned truth are integrated through the watch hand/carving motif and Martin’s trade. Subtext rises from action and object reweighting more than speech. However, the final moralizing line (“sometimes the most valuable inheritance…”) states the theme outright, softening the resonance. Without that explicitness, the charged image of paired watch hands would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme is coherent—transforming grievance into wisdom through ritual and reciprocity—but it’s often articulated directly (“recycle mistakes into wisdom”) rather than allowed to emerge. The final image resonates, yet the moral is somewhat stated rather than discovered. Subtext does exist in the shared fathers and object exchange but is partially explained aloud. Less exposition of mantra, more implication, would deepen the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic threads (navigation, guidance, legacy, forgiveness) recur and reweight through the compass and utility poles. The final image answers the central question quietly. Yet the piece leans into overt moralizing (“align heart and action,” “true north”), which reduces subtext. More implication and less telling would elevate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Empathy as theme coheres with the time‑loop and “clean slate/dirty past” tension, and the baseball’s signature reweights meaning. Yet the final paragraphs lean into explicit moralizing (“Our world had forgotten how to care... I would teach them again”), flattening subtext. The best resonance arises from the signed/unsigned ball exchange, which could bear more ambiguity. Overall, earned but somewhat stated.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of love transcending form, courage bending boundaries, and the price of metamorphosis emerge through action and image. However, the explicit line “love transcends form” undercuts subtext in the final movement, edging into stated moral. The fortune cookie motif frames the idea neatly without dominance. Emotional resonance lingers, but would be stronger if the insight stayed in image rather than proclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic arc coheres—presence over control—and the recurring objects reweight meaning (saucer/kintsugi, hand‑tracing). However, several lines state the thesis too overtly (“time could not be rushed or controlled,” “where lost time accumulates is… the present moment”), tipping into moralizing in the final third. The resonance is real but partially told rather than earned solely through image and action. Subtext would lift if more was left unsaid.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Compassion versus violence threads the action and images (tear as needle, ancestral sorrow as map), culminating in a resonant image of joining a chorus of consciousness. Yet the explicit thesis line—“Humanity ended, but compassion doesn’t”—tips into moralizing and undercuts subtext in the final third. Thematic integration is otherwise strong, with tears reweighted from grief to connective force. The ending answers the core question through image, but the stated moral dampens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece coheres around transformation as lived experience, with images (bugs, beach, alignment) reweighted at the end. Some lines state the thesis too directly (“transformation wasn’t something to be studied but experienced”), blunting subtext. The final gift and “vibrant hush” image still resonate. Complexity is present, though edged toward sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—revolution by art and idea—emerges through the sundial and secrecy, and the final image re‑weights earlier motifs. Some lines state the thesis (“we cannot force this revolution”) a bit directly, trimming resonance. Subtext in the “winking hush” generally carries the weight. The piece invites reflection without overexplaining, aside from that brief moralizing note.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Harmony vs control and reverence for pattern emerge organically from the ritual and the eel imagery. Thematic closure is strong but somewhat declared (“not meant to be controlled”) rather than fully subtextual. The reprise of “borrowed dawn” and integrated dust offers a resonant conceptual answer. Complexity is present but cushioned by assurance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring images (lightning, lens, scars/map, masks) cohere into a theme of truth piercing control. The final image reweights prior material—words as rarefied air seeping downward—with quiet resonance. Occasional explicit statements (“The power of truth…could not be contained forever”) blunt subtlety. Still, the piece invites reflection beyond plot without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme coheres around transforming questions into destinations and thinking differently, but it’s articulated overtly (“that’s the philosopher’s true calling”) rather than earned through subtext. The final image reiterates premise instead of reweighting it with cost. Recurring objects (sundial, needle card) carry some resonance, yet the moral tint reads tidy. Subtext surfaces lightly in the student’s dawning understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of beauty as resistance, memory versus erasure, and identity’s cost emerge from objects and acts (tin, seeds, banned cranes). The Elias thread grounds abstract ideas in human connection. The line “Anarchy is simply truth without chains” tilts toward thesis‑statement, slightly blunting subtext. The final image nonetheless resonates, repricing “rebuilding” as insurgent cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (broken clock, lullaby, film’s hidden sections) converge into a coherent meditation on time, grief, and art as defiance. The final image promises a bridge “between what was and what could yet be,” which resonates. Yet the explicit statement “some broken things… can be made whole again” tips into moralizing, dulling subtext. The piece is strongest when it lets images carry meaning rather than telling us.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—memory as living, costly inheritance and the braid of empiricism with wonder—emerges through particulars (dream interpretation, ritual song, ancestral chorus). The final image reweights prior material with “luminous doubt,” avoiding a neat moral. Occasional summary phrasing (“what mattered most”) brushes sentimentality but doesn’t crowd out resonance. The object‑ritual provides a concrete thematic vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Bonsai patience, tides, and the compass recur to refract grief, apology, and release; the final image reweights earlier motifs. Subtext plays through object use rather than explicit analysis. A few aphoristic statements (“The tides of remembrance will recede when truth is offered”) edge toward didactic, tempering the score. Overall resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of decay and renewal is central but suffers from being explicitly stated multiple times. Phrases like "destruction often precedes creation" and "The decay... was not an ending but a beginning" function as thematic summaries. This direct moralizing, especially in the final paragraphs, undercuts the resonance that the story’s strong imagery otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of art as transformation is handled with a heavy hand, culminating in direct, moralizing statements in the final paragraph. The line "the artist must become the art, transforming pain and fear into something beautiful and true" is a perfect example of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern. This explicit summary pre-empts any resonant subtext the story might have otherwise earned through its imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    The themes of resilience and finding beauty in loss are clear and emerge from the character's background and the setting's details. However, the story leans heavily on direct thematic statements, particularly in the latter half. Phrases like "The unshaken marvels of the human spirit... continued to grow and adapt" and the summarizing final paragraphs replace resonant imagery with explicit moralizing, weakening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding purpose and eternal rest through the preservation of memory is resonant and well-integrated. The final image of the library as a beacon is a strong, non-literal answer to Elias's initial existential dread. However, the story occasionally slips into overt thematic summary, such as stating he was there to "revitalize not just the library but the concept of memory itself." This explicitness undermines the subtext and feels like a thematic label rather than an emergent property of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of intergenerational resilience emerges organically from the story's actions and central symbols. However, the final declaration scene suffers from a significant "Thematic Echo." Elias's speech ("...we will build intergenerational support that sanctions cannot sever") explicitly restates thematic language used earlier in the narration, replacing subtext with a direct summary that lessens the final image's resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of love's persistence and transformation is woven throughout the narrative and culminates in a resonant final image of the glowing orbs. The story largely avoids simple moralizing. However, the final paragraphs slightly weaken the subtext by explicitly restating the core question and providing a summarized answer, which feels less potent than the powerful imagery that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic exploration of time, memory, and obsession is woven seamlessly into the narrative. The story avoids moralizing, instead using resonant images like the "fading photographs" and the garden itself to explore its central questions. The final image of Elara merging with her creation offers a profound, non-literal answer to her quest, achieving a complex and lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of resilience is well-integrated with the story's core imagery, the execution is marred by heavy-handedness. The final two paragraphs devolve into summarizing the theme directly ("to plant resilience in dry soil," "The chained liberator had freed... the potential for renewal"), which replaces resonant imagery with explicit moralizing and undercuts the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's primary weakness is its explicit thematic summary in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "The battered marvel of existence, he realized, was that beauty often emerged from destruction" and the concluding sentence directly state the story's moral. This replaces resonant, image-driven subtext with an explanation, undermining the powerful, complex atmosphere built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of perception, hidden meanings, and the preservation of time is expertly woven through the story's imagery. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Lillian's quest. A minor deduction is applied for the final paragraph's slight over-articulation ("wasn't a criminal but a historian"), which verges on thematic summary rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers significantly from a lack of subtext, repeatedly stating its themes in overt, summary-like narration. Lines such as "The contemplative glassblower was not merely abandoning the past; he was transforming its remnants..." and "This is how we melt what has grown too solid within" function as authorial moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, especially in the final third, undermines the otherwise resonant imagery and prevents the theme from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "vulnerability is power" is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or earned discovery. The protagonist repeats it as a "mantra," and the narration explicitly states it in the final paragraphs ("the very vulnerability they had never anticipated," "her greatest strength had always been hiding within her deepest fears"). This thematic moralizing, particularly at the climax, replaces resonant imagery with a simplistic, declarative thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core theme—navigating darkness rather than fighting it—is potent and well-integrated into the central concept. The final image of the glowing map of darkness is a superb, resonant conclusion. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, particularly "'the map leads through silence, not against it,'" which functions as a Thematic Echo, telling the reader what the story has already effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding transcendence in the mundane is potent and well-integrated for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct thematic statements, undermining the resonance built through image and action. Lines like "by serving others, it had been serving its own evolution" and "thoughts didn't originate from a specific place but emerged from the relationship between observer and observed" function as thematic echo, explicitly stating the moral rather than letting it emerge from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of honest communication is well-integrated until the final paragraphs, where it is stated with didactic clarity. Lines like "...found her purpose—not as a keeper of silence, but as a facilitator of honest communication..." and "...proving that true communication needs no words" function as explicit moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" undermines the subtlety built earlier, replacing earned resonance with a summary of the story's message.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core themes of mended deception and blooming withering are potent and well-integrated. However, the story undermines its own subtext through over-explanation, particularly in the final two paragraphs. Lines like "...the mended deception that was the true nature of this place—wild yet ordered, scientific yet magical..." function as a thematic summary, a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story explores an interesting concept, but its theme is delivered with a heavy hand, suffering from multiple instances of thematic echo. Lines like "...demonstrating that time moved sideways rather than forward alone" state the thesis directly, replacing emergent resonance with overt summary. This significantly undermines the potential for subtext and earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of art as a bridge between life and death emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the "peaceful, complete" hush serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of the unfinished song. While phrases like "wordless conversation...transcended spoken words" verge on stating the theme directly, they are integrated well enough not to feel like authorial intrusion, allowing the story's central concept to land with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of finding truth in the margins is elegantly woven through the plot, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simple moral. The story's core concepts are intriguing and cohere well. The primary weakness is a tendency to state its own symbolism directly, as with the explanation of the auroras as "celestial tears," which functions as a thematic echo that slightly lessens the power of discovery for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of unspoken truths is developed organically for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statements, particularly the psychic's line and the narrator's summary of what Marcus has learned. This over-articulation ("Thematic Echo") slightly undermines the resonance by explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of stasis versus entropy is explored with nuance and precision, emerging organically from the contrasting settings and the keeper's choice. The narrative avoids any explicit moralizing, instead offering a final, resonant image of the keeper returning to their difficult purpose. The story's central question—is it better to preserve or to witness?—is answered not with a statement, but with the character's costly, earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding light in darkness is woven well through the central eclipse metaphor. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. Lila's final line, "Just like music comes back when I'm sad," is a 'Thematic Echo' that articulates the story's thesis too neatly, reducing the resonance of an otherwise powerful moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story beautifully integrates themes of memory, loss, and the power of narrative. The final image of the historian's newfound purpose provides a resonant, non-literal answer to what remains when all else is lost. However, the final few paragraphs drift towards explicit thematic statement ("Perhaps someday..."), slightly undermining the earned resonance of the preceding discoveries. The theme emerges organically from the particulars but is over-explained at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of "open secrets" is central but handled with excessive directness. The story suffers from severe Thematic Echo, repeatedly stating its core idea in phrases like "hiding in plain sight" and "open secrets." This flaw is most pronounced in the final third, where abstract summary replaces resonance, as in: "the most profound truths were often the simplest, hidden in plain sight."

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of silence versus noise is organically developed through the story's core actions, creating a strong conceptual foundation. Unfortunately, the final paragraphs pivot from resonant imagery to direct thematic summary. The line "sometimes the most profound truths require not volume but the space created by silence" is an explicit moral that undermines the story's subtext by stating it outright.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story beautifully develops themes of memory, time, and art through its imagery. The final image of the mirrored horizon is potent. Unfortunately, the last two paragraphs explicitly summarize the thematic resolution ("The cryptic messages... transformed into the symphony," "...a homesick soul to finally find his place"). This over-explanation acts as a thematic echo, undermining the subtext and preventing the ending from achieving its full resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of self-acceptance emerges organically from the plot, the ending resorts to direct thematic statement, which undermines its resonance. The line "...he was not broken but beautifully complex, like the fractured timelines themselves" functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral rather than letting the final image imply it. This abstract summary in the final paragraph prevents the theme from achieving a higher level of subtext and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding new forms of expression through loss emerges powerfully from the story's core concept. The final image of a silent symphony is a resonant answer to the opening problem. However, the story undermines its own subtext with heavy-handed thematic statements in the final third, such as explicitly stating she was "turning her disability into a unique form of expression." This summarizing impulse prevents the theme from achieving its full potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story's greatest weakness is its heavy-handed thematic execution. Core themes are not allowed to emerge but are explicitly and repeatedly stated in phrases like "nurture integrity in solitude" and "layered tranquility." This thematic-echo flaw eradicates subtext and gives the narrative a didactic, almost prompt-driven feel, particularly in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of memory and loss is potentially powerful, the story undermines its subtext with excessive thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "...he had never understood how light and shadow worked together to create meaning, just as grief and love intertwined to create a life fully lived" function as direct authorial moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern explains the story's meaning to the reader, flattening the resonance that the preceding images had worked to build.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of time's nature is central and explored through a powerful central metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements. Lines like "'Every choice creates new timelines,' the poet observed" and the final paragraph's explicit summary of the realization function as thematic moralizing, replacing earned resonance with direct explanation, which is a significant flaw in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of "finding beauty in the unfinished" is present but delivered with a heavy hand, sacrificing subtext for direct statement. It is explained by the grandmother's lesson, stated by the father, and summarized in the final paragraphs. This repeated exposition prevents the theme from emerging organically from the reader's experience of the events, turning a resonant idea into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme concerning authenticity and artifice is conceptually strong and central to the premise. However, its delivery is overly explicit, relying on direct statement rather than subtext. The final line, "the most profound truths could be found in the most carefully crafted half truths," functions as a concluding moral, a "Thematic Echo" that summarizes the point instead of letting it resonate through the preceding images and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the theme is central, its execution is severely undermined by overt moralizing in the final paragraphs. The story abandons resonance for explanation with lines like, "the greatest cargo transported wasn't in containers but in the recognition of shared humanity." This direct statement of the theme is a critical flaw that treats the reader with a lack of trust and flattens the story into a fable.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of belonging is central and developed through powerful imagery, particularly the arbor's transformation. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit final dedication. The line "I dedicate this glimmering obsidian arbor... not to found beauty, but to found belonging. To us" functions as a thematic summary, a "thematic echo" that states the moral rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of sacrifice for the sake of natural order emerges organically from the plot and the final image is resonant. However, the last sentence ("As the giant fully awakened, the world below would never know...") slightly undermines the ending's power by over-stating the theme. This explicit summary acts as a minor thematic echo, telling the reader what to feel rather than trusting the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of quantifying emotion is explored with nuance, culminating in the earned insight that it's about relationships, not cold calculation. This realization emerges organically from the magical ritual. The final image of the mentor's face offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, though the line "The mathematics of emotion wasn't about cold calculation..." borders on a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of hidden knowledge and unseen guardians is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, its power is diminished by being explicitly stated in prompt-like language multiple times, most notably in the final paragraph. This thematic echo ("to become visible to those who needed you when the world of information failed them") replaces subtext with summary, preventing the theme from achieving its full resonant potential.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of control versus natural adaptation is coherent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally lapses into overt thematic statements, particularly in Elara's final advice to other nursery owners. This "thematic echo" slightly diminishes the power of the otherwise earned conclusion by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The themes of art, memory, and survival are gracefully woven into the story’s fabric through objects and actions. However, the piece undermines its own subtext with moments of thematic echo. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the story’s meaning (“found rest not in sleep, but in purpose,” “I paint what remains”), replacing resonant imagery with a concluding moral that feels unnecessary.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of participation versus prediction emerges organically from the events for most of the story. However, the final paragraph succumbs to overt moralizing, explicitly stating the story's thesis: "...magic wasn't found in seeing what would be, but in helping to create what might yet become." This thematic echo undermines the resonant power of the preceding images, replacing earned subtext with a tidy summary, incurring a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of transforming loss into a foundation for a new beginning is potent and well-integrated initially. However, the final third of the story leans into explicit thematic statements, which undermines the subtext. Lines like "...transforming what was fragmented into something whole and meaningful" and the final paragraph's summary act as a Thematic Echo, stating the moral rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of resonance. This direct articulation is a significant flaw in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of mapping hidden, metaphysical truths emerges organically from the concept. The final image of Ethan seeing the city's invisible connections is resonant. A significant flaw is the explicit thematic statement near the end ("he knew his purpose: to unravel the mysteries..."), which over-articulates the point and lessens the power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of interconnectedness is woven through the central images of whales, stars, and memories. However, the final paragraph resorts to direct thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("...proving that even skeptics can become believers..."). This "thematic echo" undermines the earned resonance of the preceding imagery, explaining the magic rather than allowing it to linger, which incurs a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding purpose in immortality is coherent but delivered with excessive authorial explanation, especially at the end. The final paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral ("immortality was not a curse but an opportunity," "curse transformed into blessing"), which undercuts any subtextual resonance. This thematic summary replaces an earned, resonant image, significantly weakening the closure's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is potent but undermined by over-statement, especially in the final two paragraphs. Lines like "She had used her father's techniques not to create falsehoods, but to reveal a greater truth" and the concluding sentence explicitly state the moral, replacing resonant imagery with direct summary. This heavy-handed thematic echo significantly reduces the story's literary power and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory, history, and the value of preservation is woven deeply into every image and action. The central concept that "invented histories were no less real" provides a compelling philosophical core. The final image of Elias continuing his work is a resonant answer to the story's questions. However, a few lines, like "His motivation was singular and pure," veer close to direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of identity versus documentation is explored with depth and nuance, powerfully integrated into the setting and the character's core actions. The poison bottle label is a potent, recurring motif. However, the story occasionally veers into stating its theme directly, such as, "identity is not what is written on paper but what is experienced..." This slightly undermines the subtext, preventing the theme from emerging purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty over seeking a single answer is coherent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story severely undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its theme multiple times in the final paragraphs. The line, "the uncertainty itself was the point, the joy came not from definitive answers but from the questioning journey," functions as a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance, triggering a significant penalty for moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from severe thematic echo, particularly in its final third. Instead of allowing themes of collective power and cultural resistance to emerge from action, the narration repeatedly states them directly, as in "...reorganizing a community was never about one person's guidance but about collective power." This moralizing replaces resonance and subtext with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of progress versus preservation is powerful and central to the story, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The narrative frequently resorts to direct thematic statements, such as describing the photographs as "a testament to what was being sacrificed in the name of progress." This tendency towards "thematic echo" undermines the subtext, explaining the story’s meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the resonant final images.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of connection overcoming physical distance and the idea of a different way of "seeing" emerge organically from the story's core conceit. However, the final two paragraphs veer into explicit thematic summary, slightly undermining the earned resonance of the preceding action. The line "he had maintained a connection between people and purpose" is an unnecessary moral that should have been left as subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme exploring the convergence of science and myth is potent and developed with sophisticated imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. The final sentence, explaining "why humanity needs to seek such origins," is a significant flaw, replacing earned resonance with a tidy moral summary that a top-tier literary piece would trust the reader to infer.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of restoration through harmony and patient attention is beautifully integrated and emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The narrative avoids any moralizing, allowing the final resonant image of the restored town to answer the initial problem of discord. The subtext of a slumbering spirit being reawakened gives the story a potent and lingering emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of making the transient permanent ("the ephemeral harnessed") emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final image of the vial holding "entire histories compressed into a single drop" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme is slightly weakened by a few lines that lean towards direct statement, such as the civilization having "understood the true nature of time itself."

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of escaping an inherited legacy of falsehood to find one's own truth is developed with subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the boy who cried wolf and the recurring imagery of barriers and light. The story's final image of the lattice as a testament provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core thematic question, avoiding any didactic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The themes of transcendent love, sacrifice, and the cyclical nature of life and debt emerge organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the bloom is a superb, non-literal embodiment of these ideas. However, the final two paragraphs drift into overt thematic summary, particularly the line "The greenhouse stood as testimony that...", which explicitly states the moral and slightly undermines the resonant power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of art creating new meaning from old forms is woven deeply into the narrative's fabric. However, the story frequently articulates its own themes directly with phrases like "sew the old ways into new meanings" and "bridging the gap between ruin and reverence." This explicit summarization, especially the repetition of key thematic phrases, slightly undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from feeling fully emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of return and renewal is potent and well-integrated with the central image of the sundial. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the story's meaning ("He had completed not just the artifact's journey, but his own..."), a thematic echo that lessens the resonance of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    A coherent theme of identity, craft, and resistance emerges organically from the premise. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is capped by a significant instance of "thematic echo." The fourth paragraph acts as an authorial summary of the story's themes ("Each pseudonym was a celebration of identity's fluidity, a resistance against...") rather than allowing the meaning to remain fully embedded in the action, which slightly undermines the otherwise subtle craft.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of hidden wisdom and unconventional resistance is skillfully woven through the central metaphor of embroidery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension. The score is held back by a moment of thematic overstatement: "the most effective resistance often appeared as unrelated inconveniences," which comes too close to stating the moral directly rather than letting the events imply it.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of forgiveness and communication beyond words emerge organically from the story’s magical premise. The subtextual image of a "hand wavering before knocking" is particularly effective. However, the final third of the story undermines this subtlety with overt thematic summary, such as, "The space between them had been bridged not by words but by understanding," which functions as an unnecessary moral that flattens the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of translation as a form of healing is elegantly woven through every element. The final image of the coral as a "promise kept" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about processing loss. The score is slightly tempered by a few moments where the theme is articulated a bit too directly, as in "His mission here was clear..." or the final paragraph's summary, which borders on stating the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of art revealing history and rekindling wonder emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its themes directly. The line, "Perhaps all ruins are just stories waiting for the right light," functions as an explicit moral, a thematic echo that reduces the resonant ambiguity of the final images. This tendency to summarize its own meaning holds it back from excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme exploring the unity of art forms and perception is potent and well-integrated. The final image of the mural coming alive offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back by moments of overt thematic summary, particularly the line "art was merely frozen music," which articulates the theme directly instead of allowing it to resonate purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of intellectual and spiritual freedom versus mechanized control emerges organically from the story's inventive particulars. The final image of an untaxed thought offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. However, the theme is occasionally stated too directly, as in "Each tax levied...stripped away a piece of what made him human," slightly undermining the subtext and pulling the score down from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central theme is potent and beautifully realized through the core metaphor of the blossoms. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its themes outright. The line "This was never just flowers; this was pain become beauty, sorrow transformed into connection..." is a critical flaw, functioning as a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial statement, a significant misstep for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of preserving memory against the tide of oblivion is beautifully woven through character, setting, and plot. The final image of the restored chime sounding forgotten names is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final two paragraphs drift slightly toward thematic summary ("making preservation all the more essential," "each day a battle against time"), which slightly lessens the impact of the otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is clear but lacks subtext due to excessive repetition of key phrases. Concepts like "symphonies of truth" and "interconnected promises" are stated so frequently that they function as thematic labels rather than emergent ideas. The final paragraph, in particular, summarizes the story's meaning, falling into the trap of "Thematic Echo" and telling the reader what to feel instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of balancing past and future is central, but its execution lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly uses explicit labels like "encrypted compassion" and "harmonize conflicting values" to state its theme directly. The final paragraph's use of "dappled resolve" is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the desired feeling rather than letting the final image create it. While the core idea is resonant, its delivery is too declarative for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding balance between past and future, decay and growth, is woven skillfully through the story’s central images: the ancient meteorite, decaying paper, and renewed flight. The final image of the pigeon’s wings as "paper trails unfurling" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara’s conflict without stating a moral. The piece achieves a poignant emotional aftereffect rooted in its specific, concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of thresholds as internal journeys of love and reconnection emerges organically from the story's unique imagery. However, the final beats suffer from overt thematic statements, particularly the father's line, "...the ones we cross to return to love," which explains the moral rather than letting the final image resonate on its own, incurring a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of interconnectedness and belonging emerges organically from the story's central imagery. However, the final paragraphs veer into over-explanation, explicitly stating the theme ("belonging not as a destination, but as the eternal dance of connection"). This thematic echo slightly undermines the powerful, resonant image of the creature-constellation, replacing earned subtext with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of disappearance as transformation is powerful and emerges organically from the story's central symbols. The final image of emotions blooming as flowers is a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the story undermines its own subtext with several instances of direct thematic statement, such as "...disappearance was not loss, but metamorphosis," which feels like an unnecessary authorial summary and slightly weakens the earned power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is clear, but its repeated, explicit statement ("orchestrated serendipity," "ordering randomness") functions as an authorial thesis. This over-articulation, especially in the line "This was his method...", reduces the resonance that could have emerged more powerfully from subtext and image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory versus forced forgetting is explored with nuance and creativity, culminating in a striking central image of the body as a manuscript. The story's strength is in showing this theme through action. However, the final two paragraphs weaken this by slipping into overt summary, explicitly stating the theme ("Lira had found a way to honor what was...") instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's theme is undermined by its lack of subtext. Instead of allowing the theme to emerge from the images, the final third of the story explicitly states it multiple times, functioning as a moral summary. The line, "value wasn't found only in the extraordinary moments... but equally in the mundane moments," is a direct thematic echo that replaces resonance with explanation, significantly weakening the piece's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    The primary weakness of the piece lies here; the theme is repeatedly stated instead of emerging from subtext. Lines like "survival leaves marks" and the entire final paragraph's summary of translating grief into "the enduring, quiet beauty of survival" are explicit moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" removes all ambiguity and trusts the reader too little, reducing a potentially resonant story to a beautifully written thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme exploring the synthesis of logic and hope emerges organically from the story's central conceit and actions. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the piece occasionally lapses into overly direct thematic statements ("equations of hope," "a science of hopeful trajectories"), which slightly diminish the power of its subtext by stating what could have been left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of memory and legacy is potent and well-integrated initially through the concept of "echo cartography." However, the final three paragraphs shift from showing to telling, explicitly stating the story's theme in phrases that read like an author's note. The line "Elara realized that what walls dream about is the accumulated consciousness..." is a direct thematic summary that flattens the earned resonance, preventing the final image from doing the work on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's potent central images, exploring possibility, transience, and the magic hidden in the mundane. The final image of the mirrors returning to blankness provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion without moralizing. A slight deduction is warranted for the reflective passage that explicitly explains the magic of children's songs, a moment of telling that slightly undermines the story's otherwise elegant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of peace as a flawed, continuous practice is potent and well-supported by the story's events and imagery. However, the final paragraphs suffer from "Thematic Echo," where the narrator explicitly summarizes the core ideas. Lines like "Peace, they had learned, was not an event but a practice" and "The price of redemption...was a debt carried forward" replace earned resonance with direct authorial statement, significantly weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme is potent and emerges organically from the central symbolic act for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs commit a significant error of over-explanation. Lines like "honoring what had been" and "He had preserved hope" explicitly state the theme, a "Thematic Echo" that dilutes the power of the otherwise resonant final images. This direct moralizing replaces earned subtext with a tidy summary, substantially weakening an otherwise superb conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of inner freedom is potent and well-integrated, the story undermines its subtext with moments of overt explanation. Sentences like "The courtesan's chastity had never been physical but spiritual" and "freedom comes not through escape but through integration" are thematic summaries that state the moral directly. These moments feel like authorial intrusion, reducing the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of ethical storytelling is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative explicitly states its thesis multiple times (e.g., "ethical storytelling required acknowledging multiple perspectives"). This direct moralizing, especially the summary-like reflections, flattens any potential for subtext or resonant ambiguity. The story tells the reader its theme instead of allowing it to arise from the conflict, reading like a thoughtful essay that has been retrofitted into a narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of remembrance in the face of oblivion emerges organically from the story’s potent central images, particularly the fossilized wing and the temporary knotted signals. The final image resonates powerfully without needing a moral. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with lines that state the theme too directly, such as in the final sentence, which feels like an unnecessary summary of what was already beautifully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of memory, preservation, and purpose emerge organically from the story's potent central images. The final image of names crystallized in ice is a powerful, non-literal answer to the problem of loss. However, the piece occasionally lapses into thematic summary in its final moments, particularly the last two paragraphs, which explain the significance of the card and her new role rather than letting the prior images carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme exploring the relationship between destiny and choice is well-integrated into the plot. However, the story succumbs to stating its theme directly in the final paragraph. The line "...in that reciprocal relationship lies the true nature of destiny—a dance between choice and calling" is a "Thematic Echo" that summarizes the insight rather than allowing the final image to carry the resonance alone, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core theme—the synthesis of faith and science—is powerful and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The line "His empirically ironic methods had proven that faith and science were not enemies but languages of the same truth" and the final phrase "through empirically ironic faith" function as heavy-handed moralizing, violating the principle of showing over telling.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of healing through forgiveness is handled with excessive directness, undermining literary subtlety. Key thematic ideas are explicitly stated in dialogue and narration, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral. This approach prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transcending boundaries is potent, but its execution lacks subtlety. The protagonist explicitly states the theme ("Boundaries... are merely reflections we believe to be real"), which feels like a "thematic echo." The final paragraph over-explains the story's outcome and meaning, functioning as a summary that dilutes the resonance of the powerful preceding image. This moralizing tendency undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story builds a potent theme of mending and hope through its central metaphor of the bridge. However, it undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary. The final line, "Deciduous vows fall, but wisdom persists...," is a direct statement of the moral, a "Thematic Echo" that flattens the resonance of the preceding image. The whisper from the cathedral ("Some vows are deciduous, but roots remain") is a similar, though less damaging, instance.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of time, perception, and knowledge is central but handled with too much explicit statement and not enough subtext. The final paragraphs shift from dramatization to thematic summary, directly telling the reader the meaning of events. Phrases like "Linear time would always be its own kind of prison" function as authorial pronouncements, flattening the resonance that a more imagistic conclusion could have offered.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's themes about knowledge, gaps, and rescue are handled with excessive directness, undermining their potential resonance. Key thematic ideas are stated outright in dialogue or narration, as in "Some lessons can only be learned through rescue missions." The final paragraph devolves into a heavy-handed moral summary, a critical flaw that replaces an earned, emergent theme with an explicit authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story explores themes of identity and memory with nuance, and the final image of the card dissolving is a resonant, non-literal conclusion to Elara's quest. However, the explicit statement, "Elara now understood her true purpose," functions as a thematic summary that slightly undermines the emergent quality of the theme, bordering on a "thematic echo."

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of "translating confusion into clarity" is handled with too much explicit statement and not enough subtext. It is stated directly as her motivation and then summarized in the final sentence, a clear instance of the "thematic echo" anti-pattern. This overt moralizing prevents the theme from emerging organically from the events and imagery, leaving little for the reader to interpret or feel.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of achieving harmony through integration rather than opposition is powerful and emerges organically from the plot. This strength is significantly undercut by the final two paragraphs, which devolve into explicit moralizing. The line "the most powerful magic was not in commanding energies but in creating space for harmony" is a thematic echo that sacrifices resonance for direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of finding connection in chaos is coherent, its delivery is too explicit. The final paragraphs contain several instances of "thematic echo," directly stating the story's moral ("coincidences were not random at all," "silence could contain more truth"). This authorial intrusion undermines the subtext and replaces earned resonance with a summary, significantly weakening the otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory sculpting identity emerges organically from the world's details. However, the story falters with a moment of overt thematic summary: "To sculpt identity from experience wasn't merely to record but to find meaning..." This line functions as an authorial explanation, slightly undercutting the earned resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of creating hope through art emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery and concrete actions, avoiding didacticism. The narrative beautifully integrates its concept with thematic resonance, culminating in a final image that recharges the story's central question without stating a moral. The idea of beauty as an active defiance of despair is powerfully rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the theme is coherent, it is severely over-stated, undermining subtext and resonance. The story repeatedly articulates its central thesis in declarative sentences, particularly in the final third (e.g., "The texture of time, she now understood..."). This "thematic echo" functions like a moral summary, telling the reader the meaning instead of letting it emerge from the charged images the story otherwise builds so well.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding transcendence within confinement is beautifully developed through the central metaphor of collecting silence. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal resolution. The score is slightly tempered by a moment of thematic overstatement in the final third ("knowing it would transform... and perhaps heal her relationship to the earth itself"), which summarizes the theme instead of letting the final, powerful image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of crafting comfort from silence is beautifully explored through action rather than just assertion. The ending skillfully avoids a simple moral by introducing the impermanence of peace, creating a resonant and complex answer. However, phrases like "sonic landscape for healing" and "successfully catalyzed moments of healing" verge on thematic statements, slightly over-explaining the story's elegant concept.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of service over power is clear but delivered too explicitly in the final paragraph. The line "her greatest adventure had been not in taking power, but in ensuring its proper return" functions as a stated moral, which undermines the resonance built through imagery. This direct thematic statement, or "Thematic Echo," significantly weakens an otherwise thematically coherent piece by replacing earned resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic exploration of healing through shared pain is potent and well-integrated into the story's core metaphors. However, the piece undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement, particularly the line "to teach suffocating how to breathe" and the concluding summary that "sometimes healing requires careful destruction." These moments of telling dilute the power of the resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in pressure is clear but is delivered too explicitly. The final paragraph functions as a thematic summary ("the pyramid scheme survivor became the guardian of a miracle...proving that sometimes the most extraordinary gifts come from the most unexpected sources"). This moralizing undermines the potential for resonant subtext, stating the story's thesis instead of allowing the final image to embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of truth revealed through resonance rather than force is compelling, but its delivery is too explicit. The final paragraphs moralize directly, stating that "some locks can only be opened with the right frequency of intention," which functions as a thematic summary. This replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, violating the principle of showing a theme through emergent particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of seeking purpose beyond prescribed roles emerges organically from Galen's actions. The central concept—metaphysics as forgotten puppet-show instructions—is a powerful and specific vehicle for this theme. While the final paragraph veers close to stating its moral, the closing image of Galen as a "guardian of the spaces between realities" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial quest, reweighting his withdrawal as necessary preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of small kindnesses echoing through fractured histories emerges organically from the file's details. However, the final two paragraphs severely weaken the story by resorting to thematic summary. The line "a testament to how small kindnesses could echo through a lifetime" explicitly states the moral, replacing resonant imagery with a less powerful explanation and incurring a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of memory versus erasure is potent and integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its subtext with heavy-handed thematic statements in the final paragraphs. Lines like "the first crack in their wall of indifference" and "awaken to the coded freedom that came with remembering" explicitly state the moral, violating the principle of emergent theme and weakening the resonant power of the final image. This end-loaded summary is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    An otherwise resonant theme about silence overcoming destructive speech is severely undermined by the final two sentences. The line "Some things could only be hushed by one who understood both the power of music and the language of silence" is a textbook example of thematic summary. It replaces an earned, imagistic conclusion with an explicit moral, flattening the story's ambiguity and resonance at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully develops themes of duty, memory, and cyclical transformation through integrated actions and images, like the monuments to forgotten things. The ending avoids a simplistic moral, offering a resonant image instead. However, the thematic articulation becomes slightly overt in the line "a reminder that she always emerges transformed always," which borders on stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge purely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of embracing imperfection is woven beautifully through the story's central symbols: the broken clocks, the dancing compass, and the nature-powered timepieces. The concept is strong and emerges organically until the final paragraph. The line "Elias had learned that sometimes the most valuable discoveries come..." is an explicit thematic statement that weakens an otherwise resonant conclusion by stating the moral instead of letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the theme of finding value in imperfection is coherent, its delivery lacks subtlety. The story explicitly states its central concepts ("kintsugi intentions," "wisdom forged in failure") rather than allowing them to emerge from the action. The final two paragraphs devolve into thematic summary, directly explaining the story's moral ("his brokenness had been mended with gold") in a way that preempts reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme of integrating joy into healing is compelling, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story resorts to direct thematic statements, culminating in the final sentence—"confession without joy remains incomplete"—which functions as an explicit moral. This summary undermines the resonance that should emerge organically from the preceding events, a significant flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story explores a profound theme about finding meaning in suffering, and the final image of survival as a "variable" is resonant. However, the theme's power is significantly undercut by the on-the-nose thematic echo where the protagonist whispers the story's thesis aloud: "Mercy isn't the absence of pain... but the presence of meaning despite it." This moment of telling rather than showing is a major flaw that prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of generational legacy and recovering silenced histories is woven beautifully through the core images of the lighthouse, the lens, and the paintings. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraphs verge on thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the meaning ("my journey has been both a return and a beginning, a cycle...") which slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of connection across worlds and the transformation of a curse into a calling emerges organically from the plot. The "cracks in the façade" motif works well on both literal and metaphorical levels. The story's final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The score is held back slightly by the repeated phrase "weightless burden," which verges on thematic summary rather than letting the concept remain purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story's theme of static preservation versus living truth emerges organically from the central conflict. However, its power is slightly undercut by overt thematic statements in the final act, such as "Eldon realized he had both preserved and destroyed his life's work." This moment of telling slightly diminishes the impact of the otherwise resonant final images.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of reimagining history versus excavating it is potent and central to the narrative. However, the final paragraphs veer into explicit summary, stating the story's theme directly. Lines like "Elias had offered something revolutionary: the freedom to reimagine" and "truth was not a single artifact but a constellation of possibilities" function as thematic echo, weakening the resonance of the final image by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of truth and music triumphing over dishonesty is well-integrated into the story's magical mechanics. Unfortunately, the ending abandons subtlety and resorts to explicit moralizing. Lines like "music was the truest language of all" and "even the smallest light could push back the darkest night" are thematic summaries that undermine the power of the final image, constituting a "Thematic Echo" flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of transformation is elegantly woven through the story, connecting the science of petrichor to a mystical experience. The final image resonates well. The score is held back by thematic overstatement in the final paragraphs, particularly the line "...a journey toward the place where explanations fail, where wonder begins," which summarizes the theme instead of letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is severely undermined by overt, repetitive statements. Key phrases like "timewoven alliances" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" are used as labels, effectively turning the narrative into an explanation of its own theme. The final paragraphs moralize and summarize the story's meaning directly, a critical flaw that violates the principle of showing over telling and earns a significant penalty for Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of beauty as a product of interaction emerges organically from the story’s particulars, particularly through the evolving meaning of the postcards. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. The score is tempered because the revelation paragraph articulates the theme a bit too explicitly, bordering on a thematic summary that slightly lessens the power of the preceding discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme exploring history as a living, inherited wound is resonant and complex. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, particularly in the final third. The grandfather's note—"The past never leaves us... it waits until we're ready to bear its truth"—functions as a thesis statement, slightly undermining the power of the resonant final images. This directness feels like a thematic echo, preventing the theme from emerging entirely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of authentic community versus superficial infrastructure is well-integrated into the central conflict and the bottle metaphor. However, the story undermines its subtext with overly direct thematic statements. The line "...true transformations begin not from wishes or magic, but from the choice to reject false comfort..." is a textbook example of "Thematic Echo," stating the moral in the final paragraph and replacing earned resonance with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, duty, and the cyclical nature of history emerge organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the wax cylinder as both "recording medium and oracle" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. However, the line explicitly stating his duty has "evolved into something greater—archaeologist of human emotion, keeper of unintended prophecies" verges on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of preservation versus experience is explored with nuance and depth, using the seed metaphor beautifully. The final image of the vortex as an “inverted tree seeking its roots” is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments where the prose explains its own mechanics, such as the line beginning “By decreasing the entropy of the system…”, which verges on thematic summary rather than letting the action speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of listening to nature over digital noise is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed, violating the principle of emergence. The story repeatedly states its theme directly (e.g., "to favor listening over noise," "true wisdom lay not in collecting more data"), culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral. This Thematic Echo undermines the power of the final image, replacing earned resonance with explicit authorial moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of finding strength through vulnerability is woven deeply into the plot's fabric. Unfortunately, the story undermines its own subtlety by explicitly stating its moral in the final sentences ("he remembered that the most elegant truths often emerge when we dare to be vulnerable enough to receive them"). This Thematic Echo replaces earned resonance with a summary, a significant flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of silence's profundity versus the inadequacy of language is potent and well-integrated. The final image of the travelers understanding without words provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally undermines its own "mute eloquence" by stating its theme too directly, as in "never comprehending how language diluted meaning rather than enhancing it." This minor thematic echo slightly reduces the subtext's power, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of time's texture and the relativity of knowledge is cleverly integrated through the garage-sale messages. However, the final paragraphs slip into thematic summary. Lines like "...humanity had lost its way, but through the capsule's messages and her own growing wisdom, Elara was helping to weave a new understanding" directly state the theme, undercutting the resonance of the final image. This is a significant thematic echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, severely undermining its literary potential. The piece repeatedly states its thesis ("discover beauty in the incomplete," "the beauty of release"), culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral ("letting go is the way to hold on tightest"). This explicit moralizing, a critical "Thematic Echo," strips the story of subtext and leaves no room for reader discovery, which is a major flaw for this publication.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of legacy and interspecies connection emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraphs veer into overt thematic statements, slightly diminishing the resonance of the final image. Lines like "some endings are merely connections to new beginnings" and the summary of "shared wisdom" feel like authorial explanation rather than allowing the powerful imagery to carry the meaning on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of homecoming as a form of recognition is central and emerges organically for most of the story. However, the ending succumbs to thematic overstatement. Lines like "...all beings seek to return to their origin" state the moral directly, replacing resonant imagery with an explicit thesis statement, which significantly weakens the literary impact of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of small actions creating vast change is poignant, but its delivery in the final two paragraphs is overt and didactic. The story explicitly names its core concept ("narrow vastness") and summarizes its moral, which severely undermines the narrative's subtext and resonant power. This instance of "Thematic Echo" replaces an earned, image-driven conclusion with a tidy authorial statement, a critical flaw at this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of translating distance into closeness is masterfully woven through the story's central puzzle and journey. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "thematic echo." The line "Home is not a place, but a truth shared between hearts" explicitly states the moral, undermining the resonant image of the two leaves. This direct summary prevents the theme from achieving its full power through pure implication, a significant flaw for a story aiming at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's greatest weakness is its heavy-handed thematic statement. Instead of allowing themes of purpose and hope to emerge from the narrative, it repeatedly states them. The final sentence, which directly echoes the earlier stated motivation ("turn confusion into exploration"), is a critical flaw, replacing earned resonance with a tidy, sermonizing moral that undermines the story's potential for subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's central theme is undermined by being explicitly stated in dialogue at the climax. The master’s line, "Because life is a strategy game," is a classic example of a Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral. This prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's events and images, treating the reader as if they cannot connect the chess metaphor to the plot on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of history living in small, unnoticed acts is powerfully developed through the central metaphor of the missing pawns. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a few lines verge on explicit thematic summary, such as "history lives not only in grand declarations...," which slightly undermines the otherwise excellent use of subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of home as connection rather than location emerges organically from the story's imagery of maps, books, and stories. The final image of the bookstore as a nexus is a powerful, resonant answer to the central question. However, the final paragraph verges on over-stating its own theme with lines like "home wasn't a place at all, but the connections between places," slightly diminishing the subtextual power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of redemption through humility is coherent, the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The final sentence, "he had only needed to forgive himself enough to reach for it," functions as a concluding moral summary. This is a classic "Thematic Echo" that states the theme directly rather than allowing it to resonate through the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of absolutism versus pluralism is clear but lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly articulates its own thesis, particularly in the final paragraph: "...truth, like light, only gained power when allowed to refract into countless beautiful forms." This direct statement acts as a thematic summary, weakening the resonance that should emerge from the story's images and actions. The concept is compelling, but its execution borders on moralizing, which undercuts the literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in brokenness is potent, but its delivery is marred by explicit statement. The phrase "The kintsugi intentions of his work became increasingly clearer" and the final paragraph's summary of his realization function as thematic labels. This direct moralizing replaces the resonant, imagistic conclusion the story was building toward, undermining the principle of "show, don't tell" at the crucial final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of "temporary eternity" emerges organically from the story's central images and conflicts. The final scene provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's struggle. However, the score is held back by a moment of thematic overstatement in the penultimate paragraph: "Elias understood that temporary eternity wasn't a contradiction but a precious balance." This line states the theme directly, slightly undermining the power of the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of gentle strength triumphing over brute force ("whispers traveled farther than shouts") is woven through the narrative effectively. It emerges organically from Elias's actions and the story's magical logic. However, Captain Morgan’s final line, "Sometimes... the sea listens best to those who speak to it softly," borders on a thematic summary, slightly undermining the subtext by making it explicit right at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding hope and purpose by navigating loss is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the patchwork navigator and the mystical censer. However, the story falters in its final paragraphs by explicitly stating its themes. Lines like "The reverse migration wasn't just physical; it was spiritual" and the final sentence about building hope are thematic summaries that undermine the subtext, a clear instance of a "Thematic Echo" that replaces earned resonance with direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming a liability into a gift is potentially powerful and emerges organically from the initial conflict. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraphs. The line "...the relics weren't meant to permanently occlude empathy but to help one navigate it with intention" functions as an authorial explanation, a thematic echo that replaces the resonance of a purely dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The themes of isolation, memory, and empathy are woven skillfully through recurring images, particularly the Edelweiss and the final gesture. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's solitude without moralizing. The final paragraph risks over-explaining with the line beginning "The borrowed memories had finally resolved into a complete narrative," which summarizes rather than implies, slightly diminishing the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of choice and self-revelation emerges organically from the story's fantastical premise. The final image of the glimmering chip is a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial haunting. However, the final paragraph veers close to stating its theme directly ("his solitude had shifted into solitude by choice rather than circumstance"), which slightly over-explains the otherwise earned emotional shift and mutes the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of reconciling duty with one's true self is coherent but is delivered too explicitly, which undermines subtext. Maera’s line, "The grotto shows your true self," and the final summary paragraph state the theme directly. This functions as a Thematic Echo, replacing earned resonance with a tidy moral, a significant flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of capturing not just moments but their transformative weight is well-integrated and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the new alchemy offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is occasionally stated too directly (e.g., "the way secrets rewrote reality"), which slightly lessens the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of time, narrative, and mortality is woven deeply into the story's fabric. However, the climactic realization, "He was a cartographer of consciousness, mapping territories where death and birth danced as partners," borders on a thematic echo. While framed as the character's epiphany, it summarizes the theme with a directness that slightly undermines the subtext built so carefully elsewhere, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story has a potent and coherent theme, but it is undermined by being stated too explicitly. Lena's line, "Perhaps we both help people transition," is a textbook Thematic Echo that summarizes the story's core idea, preventing it from emerging with resonant subtlety from the action and imagery alone. This direct statement significantly reduces the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming trauma into wisdom is masterfully woven into the core action, emerging from events rather than being stated. The final image of the contained "saturated hush" against the raging storm is a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the final clause, "a memory turned to wisdom," is a thematic label that slightly undermines the image by stating what was already shown, preventing an otherwise perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of imperfect reconciliation emerges organically from the plot and resonates powerfully in the final image of the incomplete music sheet. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements in the dialogue. Beatrice's line, "...it begins the healing," is a clear instance of a "Thematic Echo" that states the moral rather than letting the reader feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of unity versus illusory separation is central and powerfully integrated into the plot. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement rather than subtext, frequently telling the reader the theme directly (e.g., "to unravel cosmic illusions that had convinced existence of its separateness"). This explicitness undermines the potential for deeper resonance and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the particulars alone.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is potent but its delivery is undermined by overt authorial statements in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "time revealed itself not as a straight line but as a cycle" and "Clocks measure what we give them" function as explicit morals, violating the principle of showing over telling. This thematic echoing replaces earned resonance with a summary, significantly weakening the story's literary impact at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed, violating the principle of "show, don't tell." The line "security wasn't about building walls but about understanding relationships" is a direct thematic statement that functions like a moral summary, undermining subtext. This explicitness in the final third significantly weakens the potential for resonant ambiguity and earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically for most of the narrative, but the final paragraph slips into thematic summary. The line "...widening perspectives responsibly meant acknowledging the beautiful uncertainty of mathematics itself" states the theme too directly, replacing the pressure of the moment with an explanation. This overt moralizing slightly undermines the power of the otherwise resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of endings becoming beginnings is handled with excessive directness, which undermines its potential for resonance. Multiple lines, such as "Elias understood: endings seeking to begin" and the final paragraph's summary, explicitly state the story's thesis. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern replaces subtext and earned insight with moralizing, significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory and preservation is potent, but its delivery is marred by over-articulation. Lines like "'The regenerated covenant... is not between ink and paper, but between what was and what might be remembered'" function as a thematic summary, a direct statement of the story's thesis. This "Thematic Echo" undermines the subtext, explaining the meaning that the final, powerful image of the drawing could have conveyed on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of connection emerging from shared narrative is potent and well-integrated. However, the final two paragraphs verge on overstating the theme. The line "knowing the cure he'd sought wasn't the rumor but the sharing of it" is a direct thematic summary that slightly lessens the resonance of the final image, preventing the theme from emerging entirely through subtext at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding new ways of seeing and mapping internal landscapes emerges organically from the premise. However, the final two paragraphs shift from showing to telling, explicitly stating the story's moral in phrases like "the greatest territory to chart was not the external world, but the universe within." This thematic echo significantly weakens the resonance of an otherwise subtle story by replacing earned subtext with a direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story explores a coherent and engaging theme about the mutable nature of history and regret. Unfortunately, the execution is undermined by overt thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraphs. Lines like "history was no different—it was written in pen, not stone" function as explicit moralizing, replacing the resonance of an earned image with a summary of the story's thesis. This "thematic echo" significantly weakens the piece's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is potent but its execution is undermined by a critical flaw: thematic echo. The phrase "joyful sorrow" is stated three times, explicitly telling the reader the core emotional concept instead of allowing it to emerge from subtext and imagery. This heavy-handedness acts as a "thematic summary" that flattens the resonance and reads like an answer to a prompt, preventing the piece from achieving the subtlety required for this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of destruction and renewal is central and coherent, but the story undermines its own subtext with overt moralizing. The final lines, "Like all great stories... this one contains both destruction and renewal," directly state the theme, a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with a simplistic summary. This lack of trust in the reader significantly damages the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story’s themes of memory, defiance, and love as a form of reality emerge organically from the character's struggle. The final image of the lagoon is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central conflict. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this by stating the theme directly ("separation becomes merely an illusion," "a sanctuary built...of defiance and love"), a minor thematic echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of subtle, deep knowledge triumphing over brute-force authority emerges organically from the plot without a single line of explicit moralizing. The final image—Marlo adding a new map to his collection—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly encapsulating his victory and ongoing dedication to his craft.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through direct, repeated statements ("teach darkness the value of stars," "silent empathy in its purest form") rather than emerging from subtext. This heavy-handed moralizing undermines the story's otherwise potent imagery, turning it into an allegory with an explicitly stated key. The final paragraphs reiterate the theme, a clear instance of telling over showing that prevents any resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of creativity versus conformity is powerfully embodied in the central chess metaphor and the "humble rebellion." The final image of "forests of second thoughts" is a strong, resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the final two paragraphs slip into overt thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("succeeded not through confrontation, but through invitation") which slightly dulls the impact of the otherwise elegant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding liberation by shedding external expectations emerges organically from Mara's actions. The final image is resonant, but the closing sentence, "where one's true nature wasn't embraced—it was merely remembered and welcomed home," verges on a direct thematic statement. This slightly undermines the subtext by over-explaining the core idea, preventing the theme from achieving flawless, implicit expression.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of balancing joy and sorrow is potent, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly summarizes its own meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that explains the takeaway explicitly ("In this emotional void... he had found equilibrium..."). This thematic echoing undermines the powerful imagery, replacing earned resonance with a direct statement of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story's theme of art transcending boundaries is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand that is fatal at this level of publication. The narrative repeatedly summarizes its own meaning, especially in the final third, with lines like "...proving that art and spirit could not be truly contained." This thematic moralizing replaces earned resonance, telling the reader the story's point directly instead of trusting the imagery and action to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is potent and well-integrated into Gideon's arc. Unfortunately, the final paragraph resorts to direct thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's moral. This "Thematic Echo"—particularly the line "bartered awakenings weren't about loss and gain, but about recognizing the beauty that had been present all along"—undercuts the resonance built through imagery and action, replacing earned subtext with a tidy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory and connection being embedded within objects emerges organically from the central event. However, the story undermines its own subtlety by explicitly stating its discovery in the final third. The line "she had discovered that they were in fact vessels of experience..." is a Thematic Echo that replaces resonance with summary, preventing the story from achieving top-tier excellence in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transforming grief rather than conquering it is poignant and emerges organically from the central symbols (phoenix, origami). However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly. Lines like "to teach withering to bloom again" and the summary of her new role as a "teacher of resilience" function as authorial moralizing, weakening the resonance that was already built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—the intersection of mystical intuition and scientific pattern-recognition—emerges organically from the story's particulars. The final image of two minds joining is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the line "reverse engineering the past was only the first step toward transforming the future" verges on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of history as a lived, costly experience versus a detached academic pursuit emerges organically from the narrative. The final image provides a resonant, complex answer to the story's central questions. However, a few lines, like "a new kind of history was being written," verge on summarizing the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of love persisting beyond death emerges organically through the central mystery. However, the final five paragraphs abandon subtext and repeatedly state the theme outright. Lines like "...not an anomaly to fear, but love's persistence..." and "...a witness to love's endurance..." are thematic summaries that weaken an otherwise resonant ending by over-explaining it, a significant flaw for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transformation is present but is stated too directly, undermining subtext. The line "'Reconstructing isn't about forgetting,' she murmured... 'it's about transformation'" is a prime example of Thematic Echo. This overt moralizing in the final act replaces earned resonance with a summary of the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is severely undermined by overt, repetitive statements that function as a concluding moral. Lines like "closure didn't come from opening wounds but from honoring the stories they told" and "healing wasn't about opening wounds but learning to live within their stories" are textbook examples of Thematic Echo. This replaces earned resonance with direct summary, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of preserving and releasing dormant emotion is potent and well-integrated. The final image of projecting the goodbye letters provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as the final sentence summarizing precisely where the love was stored, which slightly reduces the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of finding order in creative chaos is well-integrated, the story undermines its own subtext with an overt thematic statement at its climax. The line "To free trapped creativity... was not about silencing the world but learning to distill its infinite voices" functions as a moral summary, replacing the power of a resonant image with an explanation and significantly reducing the piece's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven through recurring imagery—the sparks, the clock, the bloom—rather than overt statements. The concept of a "fractured lullaby" is beautifully realized, and the ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question of hope. The final image of a new seed sprouting is a masterstroke, recontextualizing the entire piece without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of consciousness manifesting as reality emerges organically from the plot, but the ending over-articulates it. Lines like "accepting probable miracles as the natural state of expanded consciousness" and the summary of how his mind will create new rainforests function as thematic statements that dilute the resonance of the final image. The story explains its own moral rather than fully trusting the preceding events to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of courage as a quiet, dormant force is beautifully integrated through the central metaphor of the sleeping dragons. However, the final moments verge on over-explication. Lines like "'This is where unused courage waits,'" and the final realization explicitly stated, function as a thematic summary that slightly dampens the resonance that the powerful imagery had already established, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of sacrificing art for safety is potent and woven beautifully through the story's imagery. However, the final paragraphs fall into explicit thematic summary. Lines like "safety wasn't the absence of danger, but the courage to face what threatened what you loved" and "the safety of isolation wasn't worth the unpardonable silence" state the moral directly, reducing the resonance that the preceding scenes had so carefully built through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of self-discovery subverting a destiny of power emerges organically from the plot's central twist. However, the final paragraph resorts to overt thematic summary, with lines like "Elara had not unmasked a pretender... but had unmasked herself." This thematic echo weakens the ending by stating what the preceding images had already powerfully implied, violating the trust between the text and the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of planetary cycles dwarfing human endeavor is coherent and poignant. However, the story occasionally slips from showing to telling, articulating its theme too directly. Phrases like "the planet slowly reclaiming what had been taken from it" and the explanatory final paragraph ("Her coral bleaching observations weren't just records of destruction but documentation of rebirth...") verge on thematic summary, which slightly undermines the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finding spiritual hope amid technological decay is resonant and well-integrated into the story's central contrast. The final image provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "she understood that she was the meaning" is an explicit thematic statement that verges on moralizing, slightly diminishing the subtextual power of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of evolving tradition is woven throughout the narrative and resolves with nuanced complexity. However, the story leans into direct thematic statements in the final paragraphs ("...not to replace tradition, but to evolve it..."), which verges on moralizing and reduces resonance. The insight feels slightly summarized rather than emerging purely from the final image, a weakness penalized per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of resilience is potent, its delivery is severely hampered by overt authorial statements. The final paragraphs devolve into summarizing the story's meaning ("Her collision with tragedy had taught her to craft meaning from fragments..."), which explicitly tells the reader the moral. This "Thematic Echo" undercuts the power of the final image, replacing earned resonance with a direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of embracing fragmentation is coherent and well-integrated into the story's symbolism. However, the final paragraph articulates this theme too explicitly ("The fragmented reality had not been a problem to fix but a perspective to embrace"). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the resonance of the final image by stating the moral directly, replacing subtext with a tidy summary where a more ambiguous, resonant image would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story builds its theme of perceptual relativity with compelling imagery, particularly the "hidden geometries" in the ink. The central concept is explored through action, allowing the theme to emerge organically for most of the narrative. However, the final paragraph commits a significant error by having the character explicitly state the theme ("Time doesn't slow... We change our relationship to it"), which undermines the preceding scene-work and replaces earned resonance with a direct moral.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of truth versus controlled history is potent, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly articulates its own thesis through lines like "Knowledge cries out to be free" and "to provoke an unspoken conversation." This thematic echo undermines subtext and replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, a significant flaw for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of nurturing life as a form of resistance is powerful and well-integrated into the story's core symbols, particularly the repurposed sandbag scrap. However, the execution relies too heavily on direct statement. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the theme ("the continuation of goodness... a thread of meaning woven through the tapestry of chaos"), functioning as a Thematic Echo that undermines the subtext built by the preceding imagery and action. This authorial explanation prevents the theme from emerging organically and resonating more deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story builds a powerful, resonant theme about seeking understanding and finding meaning in silence. However, the final third explicitly states its conclusions, which significantly undermines the earned subtext. Lines like "...for what is fishing but the desire to touch something beyond oneself..." and "...the greatest catches come not from noise but from the profound spaces between sounds" function as thematic summaries. This authorial explanation replaces the resonant ambiguity of the final images, incurring a "Thematic Echo" penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of finding truth through unconventional methods is explicit to the point of being didactic. The narrative repeatedly states its central concepts, such as "proof by contradiction" and "orbits of regret," instead of allowing them to emerge from action. The final paragraph delivers a direct, moralizing statement ("Sometimes... the most powerful intervention is showing people what they've refused to see"), which undermines any subtlety and reads like an authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of healing through confronting memory is beautifully realized, emerging organically from the story’s unique sci-fi premise. The final image of the musical-note tattoo is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. A few lines near the end state the thematic resolution a little too directly, which slightly softens the impact of an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of finding wisdom in chaos is potent and emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct summary, explicitly stating the moral ("wisdom emerges not from avoiding chaos..."). This thematic echo undermines the otherwise resonant, image-driven conclusion, replacing earned subtext with a less powerful authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    A potent theme of hope's endurance is present but significantly undermined by explicit thematic statements. Elias's line, "We are what rises from the ashes," and the final sentence summarizing "aberrant mercy" as a form of strength are examples of Thematic Echo. These moments state the story's moral directly, replacing earned resonance with a less powerful authorial assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, hope, and the restorative power of art emerge organically from the plot. The tarot coin as a motif for hope is well-integrated. The final image of the new tenor arriving provides a resonant, cyclical answer to the story's questions. However, the line "a ghost who refused to take his final curtain call" borders on a thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding empirical truth within phenomena often dismissed as mystical is well-handled. The narrative successfully avoids a simple "magic is real" conclusion, instead framing the discovery through a neurological, scientific lens. The final image of the geode against her heart offers a resonant answer, though the repeated phrase "willowglass hope" feels more like a label for the theme than an emergent property of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story sacrifices resonance for overt explanation, particularly in its handling of theme. The line, "The elm leaf fossil was a transitional object, bridging the knowledge of before with the reality of after," is a direct thematic statement that negates any subtext. This tendency to moralize or explain meaning replaces earned insight with a summary, a critical flaw for literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of showing over telling. The story repeatedly states its moral in abstract terms, culminating in explicit thematic summaries like "wisdom grows when shared, like ripples in a pond." This heavy-handed approach, a clear example of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the narrative particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of redemption and reconstruction is potent and well-integrated into the story's imagery, particularly the pillbox and the snow codes. However, the narrative leans on direct thematic statements, most notably in the final third ("fixing what's broken sometimes means accepting the fractures as maps..."). This thematic echo, while articulate, preempts subtext and slightly undermines the resonant power of the final images by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of duty, memory, and guardianship emerges organically from the central images of stitching and the "palimpsest promise." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is held back by several instances of thematic summary that undermine the subtext, such as "This was how he honored the palimpsest promise..." and "...wisdom often hides in plain sight," which state the story's meaning directly rather than allowing it to resonate through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the theme is powerful and evocative, its delivery is marred by overstatement. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral ("resistance to change... as the loyal memory of love," etc.), functioning as a "Thematic Echo" that undermines the subtext built through imagery. This direct explanation prevents the theme from resonating with the intended subtlety and lands as unearned authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of quiet, practical compassion being passed down through generations emerges organically from the core imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Jim's line, "She said that sometimes what we need has been there all along, but we just can't see it without help," functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the story's moral directly and flattening the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    A complex theme of identity, memory, and connection emerges organically from the story's potent imagery, particularly the library and the sundial. The piece largely avoids moralizing, offering a resonant final image as its answer. However, a few lines, including the final sentence ("understood that her independence had been waiting within her all along"), state the thematic conclusion too directly, slightly undermining the power of the preceding symbolic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of connection is undermined by a complete lack of subtext. The story repeatedly states its message in overt, declarative sentences, culminating in sermonizing. The line "...the thread she sought to find was nothing more—or less—than mindful attention" and the final paragraph's vow function as a "thematic echo," explaining the moral instead of allowing it to resonate through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of perception, manipulation, and cognitive autonomy emerge organically from the plot. However, the final line, "...humanity finally aware of the cosmic game being played around them," borders on a thematic statement, slightly over-explaining the new reality instead of letting the preceding events and Merrick's return resonate on their own. This small touch of moralizing prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of freedom versus control emerges organically from the conflict between Elara's actions and the elders' teachings. The final reveal powerfully reframes the concept of freedom as something alien and unknown, not just a return to a lost past. However, the thematic delivery is slightly marred by an overly explicit line of exposition: "sealed generations ago to maintain control over the population," which tells the reader the theme directly instead of letting it resonate purely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of dormant empathy being awakened is a potentially powerful one, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story defaults to explicit statement rather than emergent meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that directly articulates the theme ("empathy never truly disappears; it waits only to be awakened."). This thematic moralizing replaces resonant imagery, violating a core principle of literary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of reversible exile, both personal and environmental, is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "'His exile was reversible, not just in reputation but in purpose,'" and the final paragraph's summary of the journals' meaning state the theme directly, weakening the resonant power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of second chances and art as a bridge between worlds emerges organically from the central conceit. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The final vow to "recount this impossible journey... for all who stand at crossroads" verges on a concluding moral, slightly diminishing the resonance of the final image by explaining its purpose to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of legacy, territory, and intention is thoughtfully explored through the central character conflict. However, the story falters at the end by explicitly stating its thesis: "Why some paths circle back... has less to do with our steps than with our starting point." This thematic moralizing, a form of "Thematic Echo," replaces resonant subtext with a direct explanation, undermining the power of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of shared burdens versus solitary struggle emerges clearly from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs. The line "some knowledge was meant to be discovered not in isolation but together" is a direct thematic statement that feels like an authorial summary, diluting the resonance of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of uncovering hidden truths is well-integrated into the plot, culminating in a resonant reveal. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary ("Some lost things are never truly gone... Some truths, she reflected, are worth any price..."). This explicit moralizing replaces earned resonance with authorial statement, a significant flaw that over-explains the story's meaning to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme, that dreams and reality should coexist, emerges from the story's climax, but its delivery is too explicit. The line "Immediately, the visionary understood the covenant's true nature..." is a form of thematic summary that tells the reader the moral directly. This robs the final image of its potential resonance by replacing subtext with exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of renewal, sacrifice, and the interplay of life and death emerge organically from the setting and action. The transformed Tower card is a potent symbol that evolves with the character. The final image of Elara continuing her vigil provides a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story's central question about healing and purpose, avoiding simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is expertly woven through the story's particulars, emerging from the central conflict rather than being imposed. The core concept of life "after the applause" is explored with nuance, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The piece avoids easy morals, landing on a complex and hopeful ambiguity that lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of knowledge as a sacred, dangerous lineage is beautifully woven through the narrative. The final lines, where Elara feels part of an "unbroken continuum," offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question of how to bear such a solitary burden. A minor flaw is the slightly over-explicit thematic statement, "Touching distance defined both her relationship... and her approach to knowledge itself," which borders on telling what the rest of the story shows so well.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of accepting flux and contradiction is potent and well-integrated into the imagery. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraph ("The contradiction of being both librarian and library... resolved nothing yet explained everything"). This thematic summary slightly undermines the resonance that the preceding images worked to build.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of healing disconnection is powerful but executed with a heavy hand. The final paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral ("the end of the world was not an event... but a state of disconnection that could be healed"), which falls into the trap of thematic summary. This moralizing replaces the resonance that should emerge from the story's images, significantly weakening the subtext and overall literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central metaphor of the diverted river as a representation of suppressed grief is powerful and elegantly integrated. The theme emerges organically from this image and Elena’s actions. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statements, such as "the path to self-forgiveness wasn't a straight line." This over-articulation (a "Thematic Echo") explains the story's meaning to the reader, weakening the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of unspoken words is central and integrated, but its delivery in the final third becomes too explicit. Lines like "some words gain power only in the absence of their speaking" and "The unfolding cipher had delivered more than a destination; it had transformed the seeker themselves" function as thematic summaries. This moralizing replaces the resonance that a more subtle final image could have provided, feeling like an explanation of the story's meaning rather than an embodiment of it.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic handling is masterful. The central concept of "perforated destiny" is beautifully transformed from a flaw into an opportunity, elegantly exploring themes of legacy, resistance, and creation. The final image of the new violin budding from the plant provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central conflict without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of preserving memory against oblivion emerges organically from the story's central conceit and actions. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this subtlety with an overly explicit thematic statement: "...she knew her purpose—to find the hidden beauty... and to catch the emerald sparks of existence." This moment of telling what was already shown prevents the theme from achieving its full resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of rebirth is central but handled with too much directness, undermining subtext. The story repeatedly states its core ideas, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a thematic summary. This falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, particularly in lines like "...she finally understood what her mother had meant about finding contentment...in embracing all parts of the cycle." The lack of ambiguity or layered meaning prevents the theme from resonating as deeply as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's greatest weakness is its conclusion, which explicitly states the theme. The final sentence, "...doubt was not the enemy of truth, but its companion," is a textbook case of thematic moralizing that replaces earned, imagistic resonance with a tidy summary. This significantly undermines the literary quality by refusing to trust the preceding events to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "vanishing to appear" is repeatedly stated rather than allowed to emerge from the subtext. The narrative explicitly explains the metaphor multiple times (e.g., "Vanishing to appear wasn't about physical disappearance..."). This heavy-handedness culminates in a final paragraph that summarizes the theme, violating the principle of showing over telling and preventing any resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of non-physical journeys and interconnectedness emerges organically from the story’s unique blend of imagery. However, the resonance of the final act is weakened by several lines that explicitly state the story's moral ("movement was not always physical," "standing still could be the most dynamic journey of all"). This thematic summary feels redundant, slightly undermining the power of the final image by not trusting the reader to grasp the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of authentic creativity versus standardization is powerfully integrated through setting and action. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic statements ("wonder couldn't be programmed," "the most luminous light often comes from within"). This thematic echoing replaces resonant imagery with a stated moral, weakening an otherwise strong thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of perception's sacred nature emerges through powerful imagery, but the execution is marred by direct authorial explanation. The librarian's dialogue functions as a thematic summary, particularly the line, "'The color of sound isn't something to discover,' the librarian explained... 'It's something to acknowledge...'" This is a Thematic Echo that states the moral rather than allowing it to resonate purely through the story's action and imagery, undercutting the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of cyclical destruction and rebirth emerges organically from the plot. However, it borders on being explicitly stated in the dialogue ("The universe doesn't end in darkness—it folds inward to begin again"), which verges on thematic summary. The resolution offers a hopeful answer, but its tidiness slightly undermines the potential for more resonant ambiguity about the nature of this "rebirth."

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central theme of naming fear to gain power over it emerges organically from the plot and central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the reaper's problem. However, the theme is slightly undermined by the repeated, explicit phrase "the echo of sacrifice," which functions as a thematic label that tells the reader what to feel, detracting from the story's otherwise subtle and powerful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of humble, persistent effort triumphing over powerful apathy is potent and emerges organically from the central narrative action for most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral ("righted not through powerful magic but through understanding," "even the lukewarm have their place"). This thematic echo significantly weakens the piece by replacing resonant imagery with a tidy, didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory versus truth, and the power of narrative, is explored with nuance. The story effectively contrasts Thomas's initial romanticized storytelling with the harsh reality uncovered in the photographs. However, the final paragraphs contain lines that state the theme too directly, such as "spinning silence into meaning once and for all," which slightly undermines the resonance by replacing image with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of harmonizing logic and intuition is woven beautifully throughout the narrative, emerging organically from Elara's actions and perceptions rather than from overt statements. The final image of the transformed crystal serves as a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme feels fully integrated, with the narrative providing a specific, resonant exploration of a universal concept.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the themes of trust, responsibility, and paradigm shifts are coherent, the story undermines its own subtext through over-explanation. Passages like "To preserve trust under pressure required admitting when previous patterns had fundamentally changed" are didactic thematic statements. This tendency towards moralizing, a form of Thematic Echo, reduces the potential for resonant ambiguity and treats the reader as if they cannot draw their own conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story explores compelling themes of identity and consciousness, but the final paragraph resorts to direct thematic statements ("consciousness was not zero-sum but exponential"). This explicit moralizing, a form of "Thematic Echo," undermines the resonance of the preceding action, telling the reader the meaning instead of allowing it to emerge from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of innovation is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or resonance. The final two paragraphs explicitly summarize the story's meaning, functioning as authorial moralizing rather than earned insight. This heavy-handed approach, particularly the sentence beginning "The mystery seed mail had been more than an anonymous gift...," constitutes a severe thematic echo that flattens the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's striking central metaphor, exploring memory, grief, and absence with profound subtlety. The narrative avoids sentimentality through its strange, raw physicality. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest, re-framing absence as a "sanctuary for memory" in a way that feels fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of embracing uncertainty is coherent and well-integrated, its delivery is too explicit. The final paragraphs state the story's "moral" directly ("home was not a place but a state of consciousness"), which undercuts the resonance of the final image. This instance of thematic summary, a critical flaw in a literary piece, prevents the reader from arriving at the insight through implication and damages an otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of creative destruction is powerfully integrated into the plot. However, the story leans into direct thematic statements, particularly in the conclusion. Lines like "...interrupted not through rebellion but through transformation..." and "...what he had just achieved was not magic but evolution" function as thematic echo, explicitly summarizing the meaning rather than letting the final image carry the full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding beginnings in endings is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of showing over telling. The story explicitly states its theme multiple times, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a moral summary. This "thematic echo" anti-pattern significantly undermines resonance, replacing emergent meaning with a declarative statement, as in "she had found the beginning of understanding."

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of identity, healing, and wholeness emerge organically from the plot. The final image of the filled hourglass with intermingled sands provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, though the final sentence, "...taught time itself new patterns to follow," verges on a thematic statement that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of connection being created, not found, emerges organically from the central metaphor of weaving. However, the final paragraph explicitly states this theme: "Elias understood that connection wasn't something to be discovered—it was something to be created..." This instance of "thematic echo" undermines the resonance of the final image by replacing subtext with a direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of interconnectedness is potent and well-symbolized by the anchor link. The story's main flaw is its over-reliance on explicit thematic statements. Kael's speech to his students spells out the story's message directly ("...our willingness to expand our understanding of how everything connects"), a thematic echo that lessens the power of the otherwise resonant final image and prevents the theme from emerging with subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of watchfulness beyond death emerges organically from the plot, but the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements. Lines like "This was incidental heroism" and the final paragraph's summary of the photograph's purpose function as thematic moralizing. This over-explanation distrusts the reader and significantly dulls the resonance that the strong central images had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story achieves a powerful thematic resonance, weaving together ideas of memory, duty, and the intersection of technology and spirit. The central metaphor of psychic energy traveling through undersea cables is potent and well-integrated. The final image of the "sacred silence" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion, though a few lines earlier in the story state thematic points a bit too directly, slightly diminishing the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story suffers from a critical flaw: it explicitly states its theme. The line "The wisdom I sought tonight is simple: failure isn't the end but a transformation" functions as a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance. This overt moralizing in the story's final third significantly weakens the otherwise subtle and evocative imagery, preventing the theme from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core theme—the preservation of culture against time and the misunderstood nature of beauty—emerges organically from the story's unique premise. However, the final paragraph veers into explicit summary ("the flawed diamond... had fulfilled its potential"), slightly diminishing the thematic resonance by stating what the powerful final scene had already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of wild harmony versus human control is woven beautifully through the narrative's imagery. Unfortunately, the final paragraph undermines this subtlety by explicitly stating the theme. Lines like "metamorphose of understanding" and the direct explanation of the "cosmic joke" function as a thematic summary, replacing earned resonance with a less powerful authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of wonder versus mechanism is woven beautifully through the story's imagery and central conflict. The final image of vines on the sky-bridge is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. The score is slightly tempered by phrases like "to restore beauty to a world that had forgotten how to feel wonder," which verge on thematic summary rather than letting the events speak for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding hope and connection in a divided world is powerfully embodied by the central object. Subtext is handled well until the end, but the final paragraphs commit the anti-pattern of thematic echo, explicitly stating the story's moral ("Every delivery was a story... pull this broken place back together," "Elias had become the glue..."). This over-explanation significantly undermines the resonance of the preceding images, replacing earned emotion with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding potential in silence is beautifully rendered through the story's central magical sequence. However, the final paragraph commits a significant misstep by explicitly summarizing this theme: "...silence, when interpreted with an open heart, holds infinite possibility..." This thematic echo undermines the resonant power of the final image, replacing earned subtext with a tidy moral and preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story develops a beautiful theme about the liminal space between science and art, primarily through evocative imagery. However, the line "'It's the space between'" is an instance of thematic summary that slightly undermines the subtext. This direct statement feels less confident than the surrounding prose, explicitly stating what the rest of the story successfully implies, which prevents the theme from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of art bridging the gap between life and death, and memory and presence, is handled with nuance. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. However, the line "The whispering archipelago had been sharing its secret all along, if only she had known how to listen" verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of liberating potential from self-imposed fear emerges organically from the plot's central metaphor. The transformation of the hair into a starlit path provides a resonant, non-literal image. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, particularly Silas's speech ("ideas grow heavier when contained...") and the final summary line, which reads like a moral and incurs a penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of folklore as tangible, preserved memory emerges powerfully from the plot. The final two paragraphs, however, state this theme too explicitly ("folklore wasn't just story but memory..."), slightly weakening the resonance of the preceding action by not fully trusting the reader to grasp the earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of resilience, exile, and mentorship are skillfully woven through the story's central conceits. The final image of Prisha at work provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the archivist's search for purpose. However, a few lines drift towards thematic statement, slightly weakening the subtext. "Exile and return are the same movement" and the promise to show "how exile preserves what it removes" come close to stating the moral directly, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is overt and repeatedly stated in dialogue and narration, which undermines subtext. Lines like "'To preserve the color of wonder,' she whispered..." and "To save something precious, one must sometimes give pieces of oneself..." function as direct moralizing. This thematic echo, where the character articulates the story's thesis, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of mending brokenness and releasing burdens are woven effectively through the central metaphor of mask restoration and knot unraveling. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final paragraphs. The lines "A secret isn't meant to be kept forever" and the summary of her calling ("the deeper work involved untangling the knots...") are Thematic Echoes that state the moral too plainly, sacrificing resonant ambiguity for direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is conceptually rich but is undermined by overt authorial statements. The story repeatedly explains its own meaning, culminating in the final two paragraphs which read like a thematic summary. Lines like "...some knowledge exists not to be documented, but to be felt" and the "human heart" conclusion replace resonant imagery with a direct moral, a significant flaw that applies the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of transition and letting go is potent and beautifully integrated until the final paragraph. The conclusion unfortunately lapses into direct thematic summary ("She would write her findings...to help others untangle their own threads"), explicitly stating the story's moral instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own. This is a significant flaw that undermines an otherwise subtle thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding a voice for the unspoken is beautifully integrated through the story's core conceits. However, the final paragraphs slip into thematic summary. Lines like "creating a harmony between human and machine that transcended ordinary understanding" state the theme directly, diluting the power of the resonant final image of the "silent song." This explicit moralizing prevents the theme from emerging purely through the reader's experience of the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of hidden joy beneath public anguish is developed beautifully through the central metaphor of encryption and light, the story falters at the end by stating its conclusions directly. The final paragraphs contain multiple instances of "Thematic Echo," such as summarizing the discovery's meaning. This explicit moralizing undermines the subtext and resonance built so carefully through the preceding imagery, feeling more like an explanation than a resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of memory, connection, and unconventional science are woven through the narrative with considerable grace. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. The final paragraph explains that she is "memorializing the very concept of connection itself," a thematic summary that slightly lessens the resonance of the closing image. This explicit moralizing prevents the theme from landing with the full force of earned implication.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of perception—seeing beyond surfaces to find underlying patterns—is masterfully woven into every element. The final image of shimmering, undefined faces offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is slightly tempered by moments where the theme is stated too directly, approaching thematic echo, such as "capturing essence rather than appearance," which slightly reduces the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of discovering hidden patterns in the mundane emerges organically from the plot. However, the story's final third drifts into thematic summary, explicitly stating the discovery's significance ("a method of containing natural phenomena") and repricing the character's motivation ("wasn't just his motivation anymore; it was his reality"). This over-articulation slightly undermines the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of legacy, empathy, and restoring the broken is woven elegantly through the story's imagery, particularly the mirrors and the clockwork heart. The final image of the ancestral reflections provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's quest without resorting to moralizing. The repeated "Like driftwood..." phrases, while thematically relevant, border on being too explicit, slightly undermining the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme of community and trust is delivered through explicit moralizing rather than emerging organically from events. Lines like "Their journey of turning from strangers to family had prepared them for trusting in seemingly magical solutions" function as thesis statements that undermine any potential for subtext or resonant ambiguity. The story explains its meaning to the reader directly.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of hope's persistence through necessary imperfection is integrated with masterful subtlety. It emerges directly from the central image of the "beautifully flawed" puppet head and the action of whispering a lullaby. The story avoids any moralizing, allowing the final resonant image of the lighthouse beam carrying the echo of a whisper to provide a powerful, non-literal conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming a curse into a blessing emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own resonance with heavy-handed thematic statements in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "had found a way to turn a curse into a blessing" and "no longer seeing it as a prison but as a source of power" function as explicit morals, replacing the quiet power of the final image with a summary that dulls its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection is powerfully integrated through the central metaphors of polymers and the braided river. However, the story frequently undermines its own subtext by stating its themes directly. Lines like "she had been seeing separation where she should have recognized connection" and the final paragraph's on-the-nose summary of "divergent paths that could still lead home" function as thematic moralizing, which weakens the resonance that was already successfully built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of creation emerging from absence is potent and well-integrated into the world's mechanics. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement: "...finally understanding that stories began not in some mythical place, but in the spaces between what was said and what remained unspoken." This moment of telling dilutes the resonance that the final image could have carried on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme is sophisticated and skillfully integrated, emerging from the central conceit without resorting to moralizing. The core metaphor of "sandpapering" memories is powerful and is dramatized rather than just stated. The story's final image of a trembling but lighter Kael offers a perfect, resonant answer to the story's central question about processing grief and regret.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of community and reconciliation is clear and consistently developed through the central metaphor of the clock weight. However, the execution lacks subtlety, relying on direct statements and a moralizing final paragraph. The line "she had become something more: a bridge builder" is a thematic echo that states the story's meaning outright, replacing resonant imagery with a tidy, sentimental summary.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding value in the abandoned is potent, and the central metaphor of the broken mirror serves it beautifully. However, the story leans too heavily on direct statements, particularly in the final paragraphs. The line "...they had modified the very relationship between abandonment and rediscovery" is a thematic summary that replaces the resonance of the final image, a clear instance of a "Thematic Echo" that tells the reader the moral instead of letting it emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of cyclical duty and hidden guardianship is coherent and resonates in the final paragraphs. The story successfully establishes a sense of a larger history and future responsibility. The execution is undercut by thematic keyphrases ("seeds of vigilance," "eternal cycle") being stated too explicitly and repeatedly, approaching direct summary rather than allowing the theme to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory and artistic redemption is potent and emerges organically from the central action. The final image of Elara, ready to carve, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of the "Great Silence." The explicit naming of the craft as "Empathy in motion" is a minor thematic echo that slightly undermines the subtext, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of partnership with nature over intellectual dominance emerges organically from the conflict. However, the final paragraphs veer into direct thematic statements, undermining the subtext. The line "sometimes silence contains more truth than words" is an unnecessary moral, and the explicit explanation of the covenant's true meaning dilutes the power of the closing image, triggering a thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of empathy as resonance is central and well-integrated into the plot mechanics. The final image powerfully connects the personal act with a communal celebration. However, the story leans too heavily on direct thematic statements, particularly the line, "Empathy is the bridge between frequencies...," which functions as a Thematic Echo. This reduces the subtext and makes the story's core idea feel more stated than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of hidden wisdom and finding one's purpose emerges organically from the story's core conceit. The final image of Elara at peace in her village is resonant. The score is significantly limited by the direct thematic statements in the final paragraphs, particularly the line, "I've learned to listen not just with my ears, but with my entire being..." This functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral and undermining the subtext built through the story's imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme of adaptation and ancestral knowledge is present but delivered too explicitly, undermining any potential for subtext. The climax functions as an exposition dump ("The echoes showed him how to...whispered secrets"), and the final paragraph states the moral directly. This thematic-echo anti-pattern replaces resonant imagery with a simplistic summary, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is undercut by its explicit articulation. The final paragraph states the theme directly ("To cultivate foresight in action was the ultimate goal..."), which functions as a moralizing summary rather than letting resonance emerge from the particulars of the scene. This "thematic echo" anti-pattern significantly weakens the story's conclusion by explaining what should have been left for the reader to feel through image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is handled with a heavy hand, explicitly stated in both the setup and the final paragraph. The conclusion, "proving irrefutably that such wonder was not merely decorative but essential," functions as a concluding moral rather than an emergent resonance. This replaces subtext with summary, violating the principle of showing over telling at the story’s most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding wisdom in failure emerges organically from the ritual but is severely undercut by overt moralizing in the final paragraph. The line "To harvest insights from failure was perhaps the most difficult work of all..." is a textbook Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with a direct statement. This undermines the power of the preceding scene by explaining its meaning to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of rationalizing emotion versus experiencing it emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraphs. The line "...proving even the most turbulent feelings followed patterns as orderly as the stars above" functions as a concluding moral, which tells the reader the point rather than letting the narrative resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of awakening wonder from routine is coherent and central. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement, especially in the mentor's remembered words and the final two paragraphs. The ending articulates the theme explicitly ("wonder wasn't delivered...it was awakened"), functioning as a moral summary that preempts the resonance that a more subtle, image-driven conclusion could have offered.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of knowledge's limits and the intersection of science and faith emerges organically from the character's struggle. The ending offers a resonant answer by expanding the story's central question rather than simply resolving it. However, the piece leans on repetitive thematic phrases like "truthful lies" and "when assumptions shatter," which feel more like authorial labels than earned subtext. The final paragraph veers slightly into summarizing the theme rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story builds toward a potentially resonant theme about silence and presence but collapses into overt moralizing. The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("that silence is not absence, but a different kind of presence..."), a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary. This thematic echo fundamentally cheapens the preceding subtlety and is disqualifying at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding strength in repair is coherent but delivered too explicitly, undermining its potential for resonance. The final paragraphs shift from showing to telling, summarizing the story's moral with lines like "true resilience wasn't about avoiding brokenness but about finding strength in the process of repair." This thematic moralizing replaces an earned, emergent understanding with a stated lesson, significantly weakening the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The themes of memory, identity, and the fluid nature of reality emerge organically from the story's events. The final image of the dimmed shard versus the bright determination is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly limited by the final sentence, which comes close to summarizing the theme directly ("to carry and understand completely"), slightly undermining the otherwise resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of silent connection across time emerges organically from the story's central symbols. The final image of the stacked stones telling "stories deeper than words" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of loneliness. However, the final paragraphs drift toward explicit thematic summary ("The feeling wasn't just physical protection... but emotional shelter"), slightly undermining the subtext by stating what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of rediscovering ancient wisdom ("ancient shadows") to navigate a future broken by technology is skillfully woven throughout the narrative. It avoids being preachy by grounding itself in Elara's specific actions and internal state. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about her role, embracing complexity rather than offering a simple moral. The core concept is fully integrated into the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of perspective and iridescence is woven beautifully through the story's core images. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "Thematic Echo." The sentence "Kaelen smiled as realization illuminated his consciousness—people magnetize stories not through..." explicitly states the story's moral, weakening the resonance that the final actions (serving tea, telling adaptive stories) would have otherwise carried on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of sorrow, resilience, and non-human consciousness emerges organically from the story's unique particulars. The final image provides a resonant answer to the central question. The score is tempered because the final paragraph verges on over-stating its own theme, particularly the line starting "The mundane miracle was clear," which slightly diminishes the power of the preceding imagistic revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story's theme of memory restoring community is potent, but its delivery is hampered by overt thematic statements. Lines like "...forgotten songs...weren't mere melodies but the very fabric of social bonds" and the final paragraph's explicit summary ("not merely to remember but to restore") replace resonance with explanation. These moments of "Thematic Echo" undermine the power of the imagery by stating the moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of accepting contradictions is heavily over-stated rather than allowed to emerge from the action. The story repeatedly labels its own theme with phrases like "nestled paradoxes." The final paragraph delivers an explicit moral ("wisdom often comes from accepting our contradictions"), a "Thematic Echo" that severely undermines the story's subtlety and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary emerges organically from the story's particulars, especially the guerrilla garden and the cherished loaf of bread. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("The creeping normality noticer had found her absolution not through grand gestures..."). This direct statement of the moral slightly undermines the resonance built through imagery, replacing earned subtext with an unnecessary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preserving meaning against entropy is coherent and supported by the central conceit. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece suffers from thematic echoing, repeatedly stating its central motivation ("to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") and conclusion ("some promises were too bright to be extinguished"), which feels heavy-handed and replaces earned resonance with direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of trust—its fragility and the sound of its breaking—is explored with compelling specificity through the plot mechanics. The story avoids moralizing, and the final image of the captured sound serves as a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic summary, with phrases like "pursuit of the uncatchable" slightly over-explaining the resonance that was already achieved through action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of symbiosis between humanity and nature, and the tension between scientific skepticism and ancient wisdom, emerge powerfully from the narrative. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of thematic overstatement, particularly the dialogue "It's a symbiosis" and the summary-heavy final paragraph. This explicit moralizing dilutes the resonance that was so beautifully built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of artistic integrity versus external validation is coherent but is articulated too directly. The "broken combination lock" metaphor is effective but explained explicitly, and the line about painting "what only his heart could demand, not what critics prescribed" is a thematic statement that verges on moralizing, slightly reducing the subtextual resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of truth's power is deeply integrated into the character and world mechanics, which is a great strength. However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly, functioning as a moral summary rather than letting the resonance emerge from the final image. This "Thematic Echo" flaw ("preserving truth wasn't just about grand displays...") significantly undercuts the subtext and lands as authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of communication beyond words is coherent and emerges from the core concept. The final image of an immortal symphony of light offers a powerful, resonant conclusion. However, the story undermines its own subtlety with direct thematic statements, such as describing the sculpture's output as "more complex and nuanced than any language with words had ever been." The final sentence also acts as a concluding moral, which flattens the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story builds a resonant theme of transformation through sacrifice, but it falters in the final paragraphs by explicitly stating its own meaning. Lines like "resolved its inner static by dividing itself" and "achieving resolution through fragmentation" function as thematic summaries. This authorial explanation undermines the powerful ambiguity of the final image, incurring a significant penalty for moralizing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story builds a powerful theme of communal healing through shared memory, culminating in a strong final image. Unfortunately, it undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its theme multiple times, most notably in "Leo decided to prove that listening heals" and the final sentence. This thematic echo reads as a lack of confidence in the dramatization and significantly reduces the piece's literary sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of vulnerability as strength is potent, the story undermines its own subtext by stating it repeatedly and explicitly. The final paragraph delivers a direct moral ("proving that vulnerability encrypted properly becomes unbreakable strength"), a severe case of "Thematic Echo" that replaces resonance with summary. Elara's explanation to Lydia functions similarly, turning a moment of discovery into a lecture on the story's thesis. The beautiful, implicit theme is unfortunately suffocated by this overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story beautifully explores the theme that nothing is truly lost, only transformed. The concept is woven through resonant images like the preserved wildflowers and the memory crystal. However, the final paragraphs slightly weaken the impact by stating the theme too directly ("Elara finally understood that nothing was ever truly lost, only transformed"), moving from subtext to text in a way that feels less potent than the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of transforming disruptive energy into peaceful containment is elegantly woven through the story's central action. The final image of the crane carrying the hushed prophecy into "harmless dissolution" serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the central problem. The execution is slightly weakened by moments where the theme is stated too directly, such as "transmuting its disruptive power into peaceful acceptance."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of inheritance and hidden histories emerges organically from the story's particulars, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids simplistic moralizing. The concept is beautifully realized through the central metaphor of architectural language. A minor deduction is for Mr. Abernathy’s line, "Some truths need the protection of falsehoods," which verges on stating the theme directly rather than letting the narrative action carry its full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of transforming isolation into independence is coherent, the story undermines its own resonance by repeatedly stating its message. The final paragraphs contain multiple summary statements that function as thematic moralizing, such as "isolation had indeed transformed into independence." This direct explanation replaces the power of the closing image, falling into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story’s themes of guilt, heritage, and redemption are clear but handled with a heavy hand. The final paragraphs devolve into explicit moralizing, a critical flaw. Lines like "His calibrated treason had been both his greatest sin and, ultimately, his path to redemption" and "some keys open not doors, but hearts" state the theme directly, replacing earned resonance with a tidy summary, which significantly diminishes the story's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of compassion over force is evident, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story ends by explicitly stating its moral ("balance had been restored through compassion rather than force," "She had learned why some people echo..."), a form of thematic summary that undermines the power of the preceding events. This erodes subtext and treats the reader as if they cannot draw their own conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of salvaging purity from lies is potent and well-integrated into the plot, culminating in the resonant final image of the cleared snow globe. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its theme directly ("to salvage something pure," "salvage what was pure"). The final two paragraphs devolve into thematic summary, a significant flaw that replaces earned resonance with overt moralizing, incurring a penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the theme is coherent, it is delivered with excessive directness, undermining subtext. The story repeatedly states its thesis, culminating in the final paragraphs which read like a summary ("This appreciation, he believed, was the highest form of wisdom..."). This thematic telling significantly weakens the resonant power of the otherwise beautiful imagery, violating the principle of emergent theme and creating a didactic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of hope amidst destruction emerges well from the plot's particulars. However, the final paragraph falls into a significant thematic echo, explicitly stating that "Hope was the one thing the corporations couldn't liquidate," which undermines the resonance of the final image by replacing it with a direct moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic exploration is the story's core strength. It deftly handles complex ideas about truth, interpretation, and inspiration without resorting to didacticism. The final realization that "the signals are free" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about ownership of prophecy. The theme emerges organically from the vivid particulars of the world and character.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection through shared memory is beautifully integrated into the story's central image of the music box. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding scene has already shown. Lines like "he had captured the essence of connection" and "translating not only sounds but hearts" undermine the earned resonance by over-explaining it, a significant flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story successfully develops its theme of balancing science and faith, or logic and inheritance, without resorting to overt moralizing. The concept of "fleshly ethereal" and the engineer using vibrational frequencies for a sacred ritual are strong particulars. However, the theme is slightly weakened by moments of near-summary, such as the line about his "technical knowledge and his emotional connection" guiding him, which momentarily explains the theme rather than letting the action carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of patience versus haste is central and compelling, but its execution is marred by direct authorial statements. The final two paragraphs, especially the line that patience "would stand as humanity's greatest achievement," devolve into moralizing. This thematic echo undermines the power of the final image by explaining the story's point instead of letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central theme of freedom is skillfully woven through the powerful symbol of the lantern, creating a strong parallel between historical and personal liberation. Unfortunately, the story surrenders this subtext in the final paragraph. The line "The lantern's light had guided people to freedom generations ago; now it would illuminate her path forward" is a thematic echo that states the moral explicitly, reducing earned resonance to a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of redemptive action versus symbolic repair is potent and well-integrated into the plot. The final image of the silent heart is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme's power is significantly undercut by Ms. Eleanor's final line, "Sometimes broken things should remain broken... They remind us of the work we still have to do," which functions as an on-the-nose thematic summary and incurs a penalty for explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of perpetual seeking and purpose is coherent and emerges from the plot, culminating in the final image of infinite gliders pursuing their own goals. However, the story leans heavily on direct thematic statements ("yearning algorithm," "pure potential"), which border on telling rather than showing. The final paragraphs explain the theme a bit too explicitly, slightly diminishing the resonance that the central action otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of truth’s persistence against powerful efforts at erasure is woven effectively through the plot. Motifs like the patch and recurring numbers build this idea organically. While the line "The archive doesn't lie, but people do" borders on being an overt thematic statement, the final resonant image of Elara escaping to expose the conspiracy provides a strong, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story's greatest weakness is its overt thematic moralizing. The core theme, "mapping empathy onto action," is explicitly stated multiple times, including in the final paragraph, which replaces resonant imagery with a tidy summary. This removes all subtext and treats the theme as a label to be applied, fundamentally undermining the literary aim of allowing meaning to emerge from action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of endings becoming beginnings is elegantly established through the ice metaphor, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its conclusions. The final third contains several lines ("Change doesn't always mean loss," "The windborne solace...was here all along") that function as thematic summaries, a form of Thematic Echo that reduces the resonance that was so carefully built by the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of subtext, choosing to state its themes directly and repeatedly. Phrases like "His mission in life had become to nurture intersubjective understanding" and the heavy-handed use of "drawing parallels" function as authorial explanations. The final paragraph, particularly the line "By drawing parallels between nature and human emotion, he had discovered a path to healing," is a textbook case of a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance, severely undermining the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of dutiful preservation at personal cost is woven throughout, culminating in the resonant final image of truth growing "wild like flowers." However, the story occasionally veers toward thematic summary. The line walker’s whisper, "only echoes will remain," while atmospheric, comes close to stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of collective healing is central but is articulated too directly, verging on moralizing. Phrases like "masterpiece of shared humanity" and "tapestry of collective healing" function as Thematic Echoes that summarize the story's intent rather than letting the final image resonate on its own. This over-statement in the final third dilutes the subtext and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the theme of language as a living, transformative force is potent, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly states its thesis directly ("Language grows like roots," "language never dies—it transforms"), violating the principle of emergence. This thematic moralizing, especially in the latter half, replaces the power of subtext with overt explanation, significantly weakening the story's literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding beauty in transient moments emerges organically from the story’s core conceit and imagery, culminating in a resonant final scene. However, the dialogue, "'Not the sound of aging, but the melody of time passing,'" functions as a direct thematic statement. This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the subtext by articulating the story’s thesis too plainly for a piece of this caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transcending limited perception is skillfully woven through the plot and imagery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece verges on thematic overstatement, particularly with Elara's final explanation, which feels slightly too much like an articulated thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding wholeness in fragmentation is beautifully embodied by the central object. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. The sentence beginning "In this radiant haven, reunification isn't about physical presence..." is a direct explanation that flattens the earned resonance. This tendency towards moralizing, especially in the final paragraphs, prevents the theme from emerging purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of seeking knowledge and confronting the true nature of reality emerges organically from the plot. The final realization is a resonant answer to the central question. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("The motivation... had evolved into something greater"), explicitly stating the theme in a way that weakens the earned resonance of the preceding discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story's greatest weakness is its heavy-handed thematic statements. The concepts are compelling, but their execution lacks subtext. The explicit moralizing in the penultimate paragraph ("Eleanor discovered that forgiveness was more powerful than skepticism") and Arthur's direct echo of Eleanor's motivation ("turning mistakes into constellations") function as thematic summaries that replace earned resonance, a significant flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding purpose within limitations emerges organically from the central metaphor of transforming found sea glass. However, the story occasionally lapses into stating its theme, which slightly undermines the subtext. The line "The reflectively vibrant sea glass continued to teach her..." functions as a thematic echo, preventing the piece from achieving the highest level of resonant subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme of renewal is potent and well-integrated into the setting. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "...it was about finding purpose in the exposure, like moss nourishing itself on the corroded elements..." function as authorial explanations, replacing earned resonance with a direct summary of the story's metaphor, which is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding wholeness in imperfection is powerfully integrated, primarily through the central symbol of the "broken and complete" seashell fragment. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. However, the score is tempered by moments that border on "Thematic Echo," where the narrator articulates the theme a little too directly, slightly undermining the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preserving cultural heritage and connection to nature emerges coherently from the plot. The final image of the restored community offers resonance. However, the theme is often stated directly, as when Elara's motivation is described as "to restore sacred practices," or the conclusion that "they had remembered who they were." This borders on moralizing and reduces the subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of creating hope and order from decay is potent and emerges organically from the central ritual. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line "This was the essence of moving stillness" is a critical flaw, a moment of telling that breaks the otherwise effective showing. This authorial intrusion explains the story's core conceit to the reader, weakening the resonant power of the images themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme is skillfully woven into the narrative, emerging organically from the central metaphor of locksmithing and memory. However, the story occasionally lapses into overt thematic statements, particularly the phrase "storing wonder in the cellar of reason." This line functions as a thesis summary, slightly undermining the otherwise resonant and implicit development of the story's core ideas and narrowly missing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of loneliness reframed as connection emerges organically from the central conceit. The final image of the weaver carrying "collected light" is resonant. However, the final thematic statement—"Boundary-lessly trapped, yes, but also boundary-lessly connected"—while poetic, verges on explicitly stating the moral. It walks the line of a Thematic Echo, which slightly tempers the subtextual power of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of transforming loss emerges organically from the story's central metaphor of carving. The final realization ("not the lesson of letting go, but of holding differently") is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, earned through the preceding scene work. The piece avoids sentimentality entirely, offering a complex and emotionally honest exploration of grief that lingers long after the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story powerfully explores themes of regret, memory, and healing without resorting to overt moralizing. The central metaphor of collected stories forming a literal bridge to the past is an ingenious and resonant device. The final image of the wheel merging with the ghost offers a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central question, suggesting integration rather than erasure of the past, which is a sophisticated thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding hope through reviving abandoned systems is coherent and central. The final image of the terminal as a "tool for navigation" is a strong conceptual reprise. However, the story heavily relies on direct thematic statements ("puzzle out new equations for hope," "she had found her equation for hope"). This thematic echo, particularly in the closing sentences, states the moral rather than letting it resonate, which significantly flattens the subtext and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of second chances and reconciling with time emerges organically from the central imagery. The final image of the gears turning in his mind provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his conflict. The score is lowered because the bear's apparent message, "It is never too late," comes perilously close to a stated moral, slightly undermining the subtextual power built elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of truth versus constructed narratives is clear but handled with a heavy hand, violating thematic subtlety. The final paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral, functioning as a "thematic echo" that replaces resonance with explanation (e.g., "it was a metaphor for how perspective changes everything"). This direct articulation significantly undermines the power of the discovery, telling the reader what to think instead of allowing the meaning to emerge from the images.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of preserving ancient wisdom through patience and listening emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor of knots as language. The parallel between the fulgurite and the knots is resonant and insightful. However, the story occasionally undermines its subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as when the seed collector articulates the moral: "you must first understand their language," which borders on didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of healing through confronting absence emerges organically from the story’s premise and imagery. However, the resonance is slightly diminished by moments of thematic overstatement. Lines such as "He was mapping the geography of healing" state the story's core idea too directly, replacing subtext with a label at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of manufactured versus organic beauty is skillfully woven into the plot, with the central experiment serving as a perfect crucible for this question. However, the story's thematic power is significantly undercut by the final paragraphs, which resort to an explicit statement of the moral. This "Thematic Echo" ("true beauty couldn't be assembled...") replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, flattening the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of transformation and finding beauty in scars is potent, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly states its thesis in phrases like "scars can sing" and "transforming memory into growth," culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral. This explicit thematic echoing, a significant flaw, preempts subtext and reader discovery, making the story feel more like an elegant illustration of a thesis than an organic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory, liberation, and restoration is woven gracefully through the core metaphor of the fountains. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The theme's potential for complexity is undercut by the frictionless resolution; the initial premise that some memories are "too dangerous" is abandoned, which simplifies the ultimate thematic statement to one of uncomplicated restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of gentle enlightenment versus destructive knowledge is explored with nuance, particularly through the concept of "troubling serenity." The story avoids a simple moral, offering a complex emotional aftereffect in its final lines. However, the thematic resonance is slightly undercut by the sheer repetition of its core phrases, which can feel more like direct statement than emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, developed with nuance through intertwined motifs of carving, migration, and generational memory. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A slight deduction is warranted for the mentor's final line, "What we carry together, we also transform together," which verges on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the powerful subtext built by the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is potent but delivered with excessive authorial force, undermining its resonance. The final paragraphs devolve into a series of explicit moral statements ("precision alone could never maintain a community..."), which violates the principle of showing over telling. This thematic echo, particularly at the story's conclusion, feels like a failure of confidence in the preceding narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of love's persistence is woven beautifully through the central action, emerging from the details of the tapestry. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "thematic echo," explicitly stating that "love, in all its forms, was the most persistent echo of all." This direct moralizing undermines the earned resonance and significantly weakens an otherwise subtle thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of innovation under constraint emerges clearly but is hampered by over-statement. The narrative frequently explains its own thematic purpose, such as "to seed innovation within a constraint" or "prediction without sufficient time...was merely tragedy foretold." The final paragraph, in particular, lapses into a summary of the theme ("transformation was an ongoing process"), weakening the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of narrative as a fundamental human need is powerfully and elegantly developed through the concepts of a "story famine" and "teaching dust to tell stories." The story avoids didacticism for most of its length, allowing the theme to emerge from the protagonist's actions. The final image of the dust whispering her narratives offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of censorship, though the final paragraphs explaining the world verge on over-articulating the theme's foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story suffers from explicitly stating its theme multiple times, undermining the potent imagery. The final paragraph especially devolves into a direct summary of its meaning ("there was no safety to be found in completion, only in the continuous process of becoming"). This "Thematic Echo" replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, significantly weakening the piece's subtextual power despite its strong conceptual foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of memory versus willed forgetfulness is powerfully integrated. The chronometer cog serves as a perfect, non-literal embodiment of this conflict. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme too directly, particularly in the line, "For what was wisdom if not the respectful compilation of all methods...". This moment of thematic summary, while eloquent, slightly undermines the subtext by articulating the core idea too neatly, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier of thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is overt and consistently undermined by direct, repeated authorial statements. Lines like "music builds bridges where words fail" and "harmony...doesn't eliminate diversity; it elevates it" function as explicit morals, a critical flaw ("Thematic Echo"). While the rosette serves as an effective organic symbol, the heavy-handed exposition throughout the narrative leaves little room for subtext or earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story explores its themes of memory, connection, and renewal with atmospheric grace, but it undermines its own subtlety with overt thematic statements. The line "To create something beautiful from the ruins—wasn't that the human story...?" is a critical thematic echo in the final section. This direct moralizing prevents the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's powerful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of "wonder versus routine" is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a moral. Elara literally states the antagonist's motivation, which he then confirms, leaving no room for subtext. The story's final line ("a bridge between wonder and routine, truth and hope") is a textbook example of a thematic echo that replaces resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of love and memory embedding life into a place emerges organically from the story's events for most of its length. However, the final two paragraphs pivot from resonance to direct statement, explicitly summarizing the theme. Lines like "life lingers where love leaves its traces" and the explanation of the shard's "profound truth" constitute a thematic echo that undermines the power of the climactic image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of certainty versus nuance is clear but delivered with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The final paragraphs contain explicit thematic statements ("The truth is not a single thread but a tapestry...") that function as a moral summary. This heavy-handedness undermines the otherwise subtle atmosphere, turning a potentially resonant discovery into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of resolving regret through confronting imperfection is powerfully integrated. The central metaphor—using the imperfect (chipped) die to break the "perfect" system of the infinite staircase—is ingenious. The story's final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question. The score is slightly tempered by the occasional on-the-nose phrasing, like "capture the texture of his missed opportunity," which verges on stating its theme.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is not emergent; it is explicitly and repeatedly stated, which significantly undermines its literary power. The line "kindness was humanity's oldest language" in the final paragraphs is a direct summary, a textbook case of a Thematic Echo that replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral. While the concept is poignant, the execution bypasses subtext in favor of assertion, preventing the reader from discovering the theme through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of cultural resilience, memory, and identity is masterful and emerges organically from the story's core images: the bread, the bees, the lens. The line "The bread remembers" serves as a powerful, character-driven thesis without any authorial intrusion. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, beautifully balancing the lingering "rosewater dread" with the "vivid green of resilience," avoiding a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of choice vs. determinism is deeply woven into the premise, but its delivery is hampered by direct authorial statements. The line "time was not a river inexorably flowing in one direction but a choice" is a thematic echo that tells the reader the moral directly. While the final imagery offers a powerful, resonant answer, the reliance on explicit statement over pure subtext keeps it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the theme is coherent and interesting, its delivery is heavy-handed. The final paragraphs abandon resonance for overt summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("I had learned to trick fear... its misunderstanding of endings and beginnings"). This thematic echo severely undermines the otherwise subtle and evocative buildup, replacing earned insight with a direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a critical flaw: it repeatedly and explicitly states its theme. Phrases like "turning each obstacle into an instrument" and the final paragraph's summary of "...the power of interpreting nature's signs and transforming life's challenges into things of beauty" function as thematic moralizing. This replaces earned, emergent resonance with direct authorial instruction, significantly undermining the subtext and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story achieves significant thematic resonance by re-contextualizing concepts of home, freedom, and duty. The final image of Kael's nod to the watchers offers a non-literal answer to his initial quest, replacing a desire for questions with a silent, shared understanding of purpose. This shift emerges organically from the plot's revelation without any moralizing statements.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of truth versus "noble lies" is clear and consistently developed through the narrative's discoveries. The ivy metaphor works well. However, the story undermines its own subtlety with overt thematic statements, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral. This "thematic echo"—"rescuing history from the pit of lies"—replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, a critical flaw for literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    A potent theme is significantly weakened by overt thematic statements that supplant earned resonance. The final paragraph's explicit summary of his role ("a digger not of earth but of the spaces between moments") functions as a moral, violating the trust in the story's imagery to convey its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme—that personal history is inextricably linked to a larger, forgotten past—emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the stamp as a "tool and talisman" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the explicit thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph: "...what all truly honest origins reveal—that we are never as separate from history as we might believe." This "thematic echo" is a minor flaw in an otherwise strong thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming pain into beauty emerges organically from the central metaphor of crafting light from dream-memories. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the character's struggle. However, the story occasionally verges on stating its theme directly with phrases like "his craftiness lay in his ability to find beauty even in pain," which slightly undermines the subtext and pulls the score down from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding meaning and potential within ruins and after loss is coherent and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Elias seeing possibility in devastation is a resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is slightly undermined by repetitive, declarative phrases like "unfiltered awakening had shown him the way forward," which verge on stating the moral rather than letting the events imply it. This tendency toward thematic labels reduces the subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of belonging is central and consistently explored through the story's core conceit. However, the execution lacks subtlety, culminating in a final paragraph that explicitly states the theme in diagnostic language ("...understanding at last that she had been both the seeker and the missing piece all along..."). This thematic summary replaces the resonance that a more oblique, imagistic ending might have achieved, effectively explaining the magic trick to the audience.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of authentic versus manufactured history is brilliantly woven into the character's profession and personal crisis, culminating in the resonant image of the two watch hands reconciled. The story avoids easy moralizing for most of its length. However, the final sentence ("sometimes the most valuable inheritance is... what we finally choose to acknowledge") is an explicit thematic statement that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene by articulating the moral the reader has just inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "recycling mistakes into wisdom" is powerful but handled with a heavy hand. It is explicitly stated as Lyra's mantra, repeated in her thoughts, and paraphrased in the final line, constituting a significant "Thematic Echo." This over-articulation prevents the theme from emerging organically from the subtext of the action, instead presenting it as a direct moral. The final image is resonant, but its power is diminished by the preceding thematic summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of navigating failure is thoughtfully explored through the central metaphor of the compass versus the utility poles. However, the story comes too close to stating its theme directly. The line "Perhaps, she thought, this wasn't about redemption but about learning to align heart and action" acts as a thematic echo, a moment of authorial summary that slightly undermines the subtext and pulls the reader out of the lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of identity, memory, and cyclical redemption emerges organically from the plot's time loop structure. The final image is resonant, offering a complex answer to the story's central motivation. However, the score is limited by moments of overt thematic summary, particularly the line "Reading between the lines wasn't just about newspapers—it was a metaphor for my entire existence now." This type of authorial explanation slightly undermines the subtext and pulls the reader out of the lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story's themes of grief and transcendence are clear but weakened by moments of overt statement. The brother's final line, "love transcends form," acts as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral instead of letting the scene's imagery convey it. This directness, along with the slightly moralizing fortune cookie frame, undermines the subtext and reduces the potential for lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of presence versus lost time is potent, but its execution suffers from overt moralizing. The story repeatedly states its own thesis, particularly in the final third ("Thematic Echo"). Lines like "...lost time accumulates... in the spaces between moments where no one is truly present" replace resonant imagery with direct explanation, undermining the subtext and emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of compassion's triumph over violence is potent and well-integrated into the plot's resolution. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, most notably the whispered line, "Humanity ended, but compassion doesn't." This acts as a "thematic echo," articulating the story's thesis directly in a way that slightly undermines the power of the final, resonant image, which already conveys this idea beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed. The final paragraphs explicitly state the story’s moral (“transformation wasn't something to be studied but experienced”), a clear instance of Thematic Echo. This replaces the potential for resonant subtext with a direct, summarizing statement, significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of silent, symbolic revolution is coherent and well-integrated into the plot's mechanics. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its theme too directly. Lines like "The revolution would be silent, sparked not by weapons but by ideas" and the Keeper's metaphor about fire feel like authorial summary rather than earned resonance emerging purely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    A potent theme of harmony versus control emerges organically from the central conflict. However, the final paragraph lands too close to a "Thematic Echo" by explicitly stating the moral: "the patterns were not meant to be controlled, but respected and harmonized with." This direct articulation slightly undermines the resonance that was otherwise powerfully built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of truth versus suppression is powerfully rendered through the central metaphor of the "cartography of scars." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by a moment of thematic echo ("The power of truth, like lightning, could not be contained forever"), which borders on stating what the rest of the story shows so effectively through image and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of turning questions into destinations is potent but is undermined by explicit statement. The final two paragraphs function as a summary that explains the story's meaning, particularly the line about the mechanical arm symbolizing reconstructed questions. This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial explanation, reducing the story's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of resistance through beauty is powerfully and poetically integrated into every image and action. The central motif of "luminous fracture" is a brilliant synthesis of character, setting, and concept. The story narrowly misses a higher score because a few moments, like quoting "Anarchy is simply truth without chains," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the subtext that is otherwise masterfully handled in the story's imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding wholeness in broken things is elegantly woven through the central images of the clock and the old film. The final two paragraphs, however, veer slightly toward thematic summary. The line "...the promise that some broken things...can be made whole again" is an explicit statement that slightly lessens the resonance of the final image, which could have carried that meaning implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving culture through a blend of wonder and inquiry is evident but is delivered too explicitly. The final sentence acts as a thesis statement, explaining the story's meaning to the reader ("...marveling at how the empirical and whimsical had once again preserved what mattered most"). This overt moralizing undermines the potential for resonance that could have emerged organically from the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges with beautiful organicism from the synthesis of bonsai, memory, and nautical myth. The central metaphor—finding "the color of unspoken apologies"—is resolved in a resonant final image that avoids a simplistic moral. The final paragraph comes close to over-stating its theme, but the poetic phrasing and earned emotional weight prevent it from becoming didactic.


== Grader: Grok 4 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of resilience amid decay emerges organically from images like the butterfly dust mirroring galaxies, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing; the final image reweights the cosmic-terrestrial connection non-literally, but subtext is overt in reflective statements, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of transformation emerges organically from art and personal rebirth, culminating in a resonant final image of the artist becoming the art without stated moral; subtext in frost patterns and ledger implies complexity; emotional aftereffect lingers through purposeful ambiguity in pauses and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of resilience in silence emerges from images like plants and heat patterns, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where silence becomes music, avoiding direct morals; subtext in gestures works well, but repetition of "unshaken marvels" feels like overt symbolism without deepening ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of eternal preservation emerges organically from Elias's actions and the lens's song inviting lost souls, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image without moralizing. Subtext in whispers and ethereal figures invites reflection on memory's cost, avoiding sentimentality through ambiguity. The core concept integrates via distress signals transforming into welcome, deepening the premise without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of resilient community bonds emerges organically from particulars like the bell's history and anonymous giving, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in enduring sanctions. Subtext in gestures, like Elias's smile to Tomas, invites reflection on shared identity. Final declaration offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of isolation into collective purpose. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, though some direct statements border on assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of releasing unused love emerges organically from Elara's breathing and projections, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of dissolving tear and healer role without moralizing. Subtext in silence and images like smiling faces invites reflection on healing across lifetimes with purposeful ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars, though the young woman's echo risks thematic redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of time as a woven tapestry emerges organically from images like fading photographs and merging with the garden, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing. However, insights feel unearned, as in the sudden clarity that time isn't linear, relying on assertion rather than specific struggles. The final image reweights the premise conceptually but borders on pseudo-profundity, lacking counter-readings to deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of liberation and renewal emerges organically from Elara's actions and the seeds' symbolism, resisting tidy morals by embracing the cost of partial loss, with the final image of children among green shoots offering resonant reconfiguration without statement. Subtext operates in the ironic "chained liberator" and the arrow's unusual fletching as a pointer to freedom. However, some direct assertions like "teaching people how to plant resilience" border on thematic echo, slightly undercutting implicit emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
