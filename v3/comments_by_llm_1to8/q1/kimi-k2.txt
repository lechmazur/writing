    Mara's internal shift from studying millisecond collapses to understanding gradual decay creates genuine character evolution. The "preprocess reality" trait manifests concretely through her spectral analysis of butterfly dust and measured responses. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "buffering the world to soften its edges" which lacks fuller embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's shift from seeking vengeance to choosing remembrance is earned through concrete discoveries—the kiln's remains, the projected ledger, her mentor's cryptic message about pauses.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rowan's progression from drowning survivor to silence-translator is earned through concrete embodied details ("salt-blistered tongue," "frost-numb palms").

Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of his emotional color-mapping, which occasionally relies on color labels rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's characterization succeeds through his "inadvertently stubborn" refusal to let even memories go unburied, driving him to literally walk into the sea. His motivation coheres well - thirty years of undertaking creates believable obsession with proper rest. The transition from undertaker to lighthouse keeper feels earned through accumulated symbolic weight, though internal contradiction could be more visceral in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's characterization succeeds through embodied ritual and specific gestural details (bell kissed like a relic, flour-dusted finger blessing). Her motivation as community keeper coheres through concrete actions. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "tomorrow is already planted" which edges toward label-speak at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong internal contradiction between past/present selves drives the piece, with embodied emotion ("trembling," jade warming in palm, heat traveling up arm). The final integration of pilgrim and artist selves shows earned change through specific mystical causality. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("who she had failed to become") but the embodied details compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to discover time's texture is embodied through concrete actions—pressing the halo fragment to bark, kneading moments like clay.

Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her quest lacking immediate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The liberator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like studying the key pattern "with the patience of someone who had learned to wait inside cages."

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to understand trust breaking after losing their brother creates compelling internal contradiction between scientific pursuit and grief.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thief's transformation from stealing to releasing portraits shows clear internal conflict acted out through concrete choices, with the jar's weight serving as embodied emotional state. The final renunciation carries visible cost as she abandons her method and identity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous disbelief") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's progression from habitual abandonment to commitment is earned through concrete details like the bookmark scraping ice and her narrating mundane tasks. The contradiction between her pattern of leaving and her desire to create "safe zones for inquiry" creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation crystallizes through concrete discoveries, with internal conflict between fear of heights and professional identity driving choices. The twin's presence feels somewhat convenient, but the protagonist's final stance ("I'm done falling for you") lands with earned authority.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle's obsession drives concrete actions throughout—climbing, mapping silences, tearing her sleeve for the legend—with embodied detail like "mildly obsessed heartbeat" and "trembling legs."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    J-9's internal conflict between programmed guilt suppression and emerging consciousness drives meaningful choices, particularly the decision to integrate rather than escape the loops.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The registrars' motivations emerge through concrete actions—pocketing the lens, decoding doodles, offering reconciliation—with embodied tension in "pulls a new stub from her coat and begins scribbling."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's characterization achieves depth through embodied details—"hands mapped with scars and chlorophyll stains"—and her marble ritual reveals values through action rather than declaration. The final choice to leave the split marble buried carries visible cost ("some deceptions, once mended, must stay in the earth"). Minor deduction for the queen's somewhat stock skepticism, though her transformation lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to prove lateral time theory driven by grief over her lost brother creates genuine emotional stakes. The contradiction between her "obliging" public persona and private urgency adds depth.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to "disrupt the legend" drives concrete actions through water, program examination, and clarinet performance. The contradictory impulses between seeking the ghost's code and being "inspired by the silence itself" create genuine tension. Her final choice to play "a single, wordless note" earns the transformation through prior exploration, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("destiny rather than trespass").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle and Elias demonstrate clear internal contradiction through embodied moments—her "fault-tolerant" method of accumulating error until "contradiction can be held," his decade of filing climate data "under routine" while knowing the truth. The final handholding with space "wide enough for both confession and forgiveness" earns the closure with visible emotional cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("swallowed truth inside him shift, a glacial shard").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal contradiction between skepticism and belief ("religiously skeptical") plays out through concrete micro-choices—touching the wheel despite knowing "artifacts woke stories," carrying the Saint Jude medal. The final renunciation of certainty about the medal's purpose ("no longer sure if it was luck or merely ballast") shows earned character movement with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation to witness without judgment is consistent and embodied through concrete actions (folding the swan, stepping through obsidian, recording chronicles), with internal tension between preserving and releasing memory. The character's endurance choice at closure—continuing to witness and record as he crumbles—shows earned stasis with visible cost ("crumbling in place"). However, lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the keeper's acceptance feels too settled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's motivation to nurture wonder through music therapy is embodied in concrete actions—carrying the curl, sharing music with Rowan, ultimately gifting the keepsake. Rowan's muteness and eventual speaking ("It didn't hurt") shows earned change through the shared musical moment, with visible cost in the surrendered curl.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from compulsive collector to courier is earned through concrete discoveries, with her sensitively perceptive nature manifesting in tactile interactions with walls and tapestry.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to map memories onto the nautilus shell to access lost symphonies is clear and drives concrete actions throughout. Her "chronologically homesick" state manifests in embodied ways—pressing the shell to her ear, hurrying to pin memories before exhaustion hits. The final choice to step through the mirrored horizon and pass the shell to her younger self carries visible cost (exhaustion as "gentle downbeat") and forecloses her adult existence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gravity defier's internal contradiction between weightlessness and the desire to land drives genuine complexity, with the tablet-hurling choice earning its cost through established causality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is embodied through specific sensory loss ("palms on soundboards, wrists against throats") and the numbness that has crept "past her ears into her chest."

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the "filament of hush" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's internal conflict between sharing and hoarding knowledge manifests through concrete actions (hiding the tube, allowing discovery), and her protective feeling toward the breach creates genuine contradiction. The choice to leave the tube for discovery carries visible cost—she "kissed it coolly like releasing a child to the unknown." However, the follower remains too shadowy to fully pressure her decision, and some interiority veers toward abstraction ("integrity need not scream").

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's transformation from commodifier to guardian is earned through embodied grief ("slow collapse of his shoulders") and concrete memory of his mother. The contradiction between selling memories and understanding their true value drives authentic internal conflict. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in the resolution's completeness.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—fingers tracing rope fibers, finding ochre clay and blonde hair—rather than abstract contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The violinist's motivation to "unbind the silence" through storytelling rather than music creates a clear internal tension, and her acoustic perception drives specific choices like speaking to the hush itself.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vale's internal contradiction between professional detachment and emerging vulnerability drives a meaningful transformation with visible cost. The final choice to take the buyer's hand represents earned renunciation of distance, though some emotional labeling ("professionally thorough horror") slightly dulls embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marisol's motivation is clear and rooted in her mother's sacrifice, driving her to uplift silent contributors. The locket photo creates concrete embodiment of this impulse. However, the rapid introduction of multiple secondary characters (Theo, Marta, stevedore's daughter) dilutes focus, and some emotional transitions feel compressed rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to escape artistic isolation drives concrete choices throughout, from traveling to the crater to initiating the collaborative sculpture. The "luminescent ache" is effectively embodied through specific actions rather than labels. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("boldly sympathetic") but the closure choice to carve her signature shows earned vulnerability with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to complete the bestiary drives concrete choices throughout, with embodied tension in the trembling pencil and the warm pendant against lips. The character makes consequential micro-choices (flicking borrowed future, speaking "uncage") that reveal her willingness to steal from the giant's time despite knowing the cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "infinity symbol" mechanics that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is grounded in the specific loss of her sister to a mirror, and her internal journey from trying to "solve" grief mathematically to accepting it as a corridor is earned through concrete actions with the glass eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)

The final moment where she enables connection between the runaway and the custodian's voice shows earned character agency with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "visibility" early on that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's grief-rooted stasis and eventual release are earned through accumulated embodied moments—pressing the leaf, touching moss, sitting beneath the linden.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ishka's exhausted insomnia and paint-smeared fingers establish clear motivation, with the amber brooch triggering embodied memory ("her muscles performed it with the solemnity of a verdict"). The exchange choice lands with palpable cost—trading tangible amber warmth for painted possibility—though the stranger's motivation remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pilgrim and clairvoyant exhibit clear, contradictory motivations (seeking vs. knowing) with embodied emotional progression through tears, trembling, and physical reaching. The transformation from certainty to wonder ("I didn't see this") carries genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unseen forces" and "overlapping shadows" that occasionally drift toward conceptual summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation as an exile returning to compile fragments into meaning is clear and consistent, with her "reactively visionary" trait manifesting through concrete actions like seeing "futures in the gaps between boards."

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of internal passengers and some therapy-speak ("map my failures") in the climactic revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's skepticism-to-acceptance arc is earned through embodied discovery ("memories not her own fluttered against her ribs like trapped moths").

The recognition of her mother's death date creates genuine vulnerability, though some interior passages lean toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra's immortal boredom and dimensional awareness create clear motivation that drives her choice to risk the escondite's stability.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's transformation from drowned-but-living to becoming "the space between stories" is earned through consistent interiority and embodied details like pocketing rumors "like smooth stones."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—her fingers bleeding as she plays, the laugh caught between "delight and despair."

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "myth buster" profession that lacks grounding in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's "orderly intuitive" gift manifests concretely through her ability to read the city's hidden grid and decode graffiti messages, with clear internal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crater inspector's motivation is concrete and embodied through specific actions—climbing through thinning atmosphere, carrying the sand grain, calibrating the chemical timer.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes every action through tactile and auditory perception. Her motivation is clear and embodied through specific sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tuner's "infinite patience" manifests through deliberate, measured actions that accumulate toward restoration, with his final withdrawal showing earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's contradictory impulses—preserve memory vs. survive—act simultaneously through the crystal vial's physical presence against her glove while oxygen depletes.

Internal conflict embodied through concrete action of letting perfume fall, not just declared.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)

    Mara's internal contradiction between invented/real identity drives concrete choices (chalk symbols, backward walking, surface mail selection). The final choice to mail the letter with chalk marginalia shows earned renunciation of digital speed for analog meaning, with visible cost in her vulnerability ("ten pages... every alias"). Embodied emotion through physical details (clipboard as shield, heart ticking) avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and specific, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (the fool's mask versus her tactical wisdom).

The "fool who had never spoken a wise word aloud" creates genuine dramatic irony through the gap between performance and reality.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lin's characterization succeeds through embodied details like her stomach folding "like wet paper" and her sitting "knees together, posture shrewdly innocent."

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander's motivation as a smuggler of banned alphabets is immediately clear and consistent. His internal world shows concrete embodiment ("seed beneath his tongue," "smiled the disarming smile") and contradictory impulses (preserving language while accepting potential self-destruction). The final incomplete line "grafting onto every" suggests cost through unfinished transformation, though the truncation weakens full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "translate silence into music" after losing hearing is embodied through concrete gestures and internal contradictions (joy within sorrow). The final choice to submerge and then return inland shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("distilled joy") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arsonist's internal contradiction between destroyer and preserver drives meaningful choices, particularly in the transformation from burning libraries to creating art as redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's internal conflict between borrowed and authentic memories creates genuine tension through embodied action (drumming, tasting salt/rosin), though some passages drift toward abstract emotional summary ("quiet rebellion flared like dawn frost"). The final choice to redistribute memories while keeping her own shows earned agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to prove whispers travel farther than shouts drives concrete action through the labyrinth test, with the zodiac coin serving as both inheritance and guide. The final choice to whisper "remember" demonstrates earned agency with visible cost—the entire port freezes, hearing mothers' lullabies. Minor deduction for the guard/Aquarius setup that doesn't fully pay off in the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's silent vow and ritualistic actions create a consistent character whose motivation emerges through accumulated detail rather than stated intent. The choice to feed starlight to the canal and ultimately save the child demonstrates agency through pattern and ritual, with visible cost in his physical strain ("joints creaking like old ropes").

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation to teach "humble rebellion" through chess is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like arranging pawns and hearing unspoken words from books. The final choice to continue teaching "one quiet move at a time" shows earned endurance with visible community-wide impact. However, the secondary characters remain purely functional without genuine pressure on Mara's choices, and some emotional transitions (like the townspeople's instant understanding) lack the messiness of real psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal conflict between conforming grace and authentic fierceness drives a credible transformation, with embodied emotions like "the scrimshaw burn hotter" and "water waist-high, breathing the impossible air." The choice to "detach from the fear that had moored her" lands with visible cost—abandoning the known world. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("authenticity over amnesty") that briefly pulls from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied grief through the farmer's physical reactions ("flinched," "hand twitched") and the performer's blank-faced void that "carried a faint echo" by the end. The farmer's contradictory impulses (reaching then withdrawing from the bouquet) play out in scene. Minor deduction for the performer remaining somewhat opaque despite POV access.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like "the old ache return—the need to stride through boundaries" and her transformation from frozen certainty to flowing song.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to "find beauty in imperfection" drives consistent choices through trades and arrangements, with contradictory impulses evident in her hesitation over the reed tongue bargain ("pretending the bargain stung less than it did").

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bell ringer's characterization succeeds through embodied contradictions—"powerfully gentle" manifests in concrete actions like lifting sleeping birds and releasing trapped sounds. Her transformation from pilgrim to sanctuary feels earned through accumulated gestures, though some interior passages drift toward abstraction ("the silence inside her feels heavier than any cathedral bell").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mourning jewelry maker's grief-driven transformation from loss to cultivation is earned through concrete particulars—jet beads becoming mulch, the unfinished locket planted as seed. Her internal contradiction between holding on and letting go plays out through physical actions (polishing lenses, folding cranes) rather than declaration. The final choice to become "gardener of the possible" carries visible cost: she releases the child's lock of hair, accepting separation to enable growth.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation as a cartomancer mapping cultural collapse is clear and consistent, with her "steadily curious" trait driving concrete actions like measuring the loft and arranging cards.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "atoms of nostalgia" that occasionally drifts toward conceptual language rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical interaction with the river stone ("pressed the river stone to her lips, feeling its coolness turn warm"). The internal conflict between her duty to catalogue versus her need to intervene creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("luminous regret" repeated without fuller embodiment).

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal conflict between trust and betrayal manifests through concrete actions—reconstructing the tail while processing fraud—with embodied emotion ("fragile convictions tremble"). The transformation from naive trust to "tensile, like spider silk after rain" is earned through specific micro-choices, though some interior passages edge toward over-articulation ("the layer that believed every promise, the layer that equated kindness with naivety").

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation through the telepathic burden and brother's death is vivid and embodied, particularly in "her tongue tasting of iodine and regret" and the plants' whispered "tunnel." The internal contradiction between seeking closure and opening wounds drives meaningful choices. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where removing the shard immediately ends her telepathy without more complex emotional residue.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara's contradictory impulses—preserving versus releasing the past—act throughout the scene, culminating in her choice to leave the quartz but carry the tune forward. The psychometry reading creates embodied, specific interiority ("incubating the emulsion's memories the way a nightjar warms an alien egg"). Her final renunciation of stasis ("She would not follow, but she would no longer stand still") carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("breath crystallizing into small ghosts," "iron taste of silence"). The protagonist's struggle between trapped creativity and fear is visceral and consistent. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around creativity that could be more embodied ("pressure of unmade art").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guard's motivation to "cultivate sparks in unlit corners" manifests through consistent actions—planting the clock, tending saplings, following the spreading glow. His acceptance of lost dreams and choice to grow new forests from the archive's discarded possibilities shows clear internal logic. The final cost of endless guardianship ("occasionally everywhere, a wave function of guardianship") lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "rediscover the wild frontier of her mind" drives consistent choices through unraveling identity and memory, with embodied contradictions like the gear being "warm as a sparrow's heart" yet mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The boy's internal conflict between fleeing and "Stay" drives authentic tension, with embodied fear ("eyes wide as harbor mouths") and the ferry guides' patient wisdom creating genuine character pressure. The transformation from broken leash to light-thread lacks some causal grounding but lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bellhop's internal conflict between "frostbitten hope" and "the warmth of forgetting" drives a genuine choice with visible cost. His transformation from nameless extension of the fortress to speaking "Enough" earns its weight through accumulated embodied details (numb fingers, returning nerves).

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thimble's motivation to expose the pretender drives clear, consistent choices with embodied tension in his "storm gathering behind amber eyes" and the physical weight of the ink pellet.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a coral bleaching witness, driving her obsessive quest to understand vanishing shipping lanes. Her tapping practice inherited from her grandfather creates specific embodied action, and her descent into the ocean chamber represents a genuine risk with visible cost—she must literally go underwater to witness truth. The character makes consistent micro-choices (assembling the raft, following coordinates she doesn't remember writing) that reveal her commitment despite uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation emerges clearly through embodied details—toes curling on cold ferrocrete, the "awkwardly confident" gait that makes elbows swing too wide.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)

The final choice to unseal the embryo carries visible communal cost. Minor deduction for the youngest mason's slightly convenient articulation at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction between numbness and hypervigilance ("somatic markers") creates authentic complexity, particularly in how her body remembers danger while she seeks stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal journey from "crestfallen" to "crest no longer fallen" is earned through concrete micro-choices: weaving memory threads, stepping through her painted door, and choosing to sketch "not the skull but the light inside it."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alba's serene anger creates a distinctive emotional signature that drives her choices throughout, particularly her decision to step through the doorway without hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("fingertips, now violet with chill") and clear motivation rooted in past love and moral conflict. The "bravely conflicted" tension plays out through specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila's pacifist stance amid violence shows clear motivation through concrete actions (offering the rose instead of weapons, grafting cuttings with deliberate calm). Her internal conflict between father's legacy and her own values manifests in embodied moments. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("continuity through chaos") that could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's transformation from cool-headed to "burning" is earned through concrete embodied cost—her pulse racing "for the first time since childhood" as the spike drinks her heat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Octavia's motivation to disprove her father's orbital shame is clear and consistent, with embodied details like thumbing the rosewood nib and tasting "meteorite justice." The mathematical proof as emotional resolution shows character-specific problem-solving. However, the journalist remains underdeveloped as mere witness, and some emotional transitions (moist eyes to feeling "oddly light") lack intermediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and guilt, with contradictory impulses (needing to silence the cry yet seeking it out) acting simultaneously throughout. The final choice to bind the cry shows earned agency with visible cost—she carries the guilt as "a freckle" rather than erasing it entirely. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("old guilt," "grief") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artist's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete micro-choices throughout—drawing spirals over ruined geometry, pressing palm to tile flake, walking away from the city's roar.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Characters show genuine internal contradiction through concrete action (Azim's radical gentleness, Leylah's exhausted softness instead of expected revenge).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost's motivation crystallizes through embodied yearning—her "encore-seeking heart flickering between decades" and the physical act of rehearsing an ungranted bow.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to map the sensory void before language returns is clear and drives her choices throughout.

Minor deduction for the sleeper's somewhat abstract presence lacking full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hourglass turner's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—her amber-stained fingers working "without hurry" and the physical act of arranging buttons to decode prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The burned spy's internal conflict between past betrayal and the need for redemption drives credible choices, with embodied details like "gloved fingers brushing drifts" and the tactile pillbox clicks.

The final handholding and descent show earned reconciliation with visible cost in their careful "prudently daring the warmth."

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete details (the bead warming in his pocket, his tightening throat at the lacework hand) and his acceptance of the mysterious passenger despite recognizing danger shows layered psychology. His final choice to take the yarn needle demonstrates earned transformation through accumulated loss rather than sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kiran's meditation-as-action characterization works well, with his choice to "follow the blooming over the char" creating genuine stakes. The internal consistency holds as he navigates fractured timelines through embodied perception rather than abstract philosophy. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where kindness alone seems to heal the wasteland.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" manifests through concrete action as she hums with "the rhythm of oars in water" to revive the rose.

The final choice to instill light "quietly, completely" demonstrates earned agency with visible cost in her creaking knees and night-long labor.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal journey from isolation to independence is earned through concrete embodied details—the aching joints, the brass whale forming against her chest, the mirror-scales settling on her shoulders. Her choice to descend rather than remain crystallizes with visible cost (leaving the known library for the unknown world), though some interiority edges toward abstract ("isolation was not a prison but a seed").

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arin's motivation as a ghostwriter seeking to return secrets is clear and consistent. The internal conflict between holding others' secrets and releasing them manifests through concrete action with the twig. However, Elian's arc feels underdeveloped—his shift from "can't sculpt absent truth" to sudden collaboration lacks sufficient causality. The final transformation reads more as thematic convenience than earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her mentor's death ("broken jaw after the tricksters' last game"), driving credible choices under pressure.

The final choice to leave the transmitter running shows earned agency with visible community-level cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction that manifests physically ("lungs tighten like fists") while she forces herself forward, and her mother's ghost provides earned emotional stakes. The final choice to fuse the compass points carries visible cost through her mother's fading, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("vastness of what lay beyond the walls").

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's face-blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes his artistic method and drives the closure's recognition moment. The woman's ambiguity and final gesture of smearing the voids embodies contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's motivation to honor her ancestor drives meaningful choices throughout, with the copper nail serving as both physical and emotional anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fiddler's transformation from observer to participant is earned through concrete actions (playing the hitchhiker's route, climbing the light staircase, accepting the fragment).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo's motivation coheres through the polished calm of someone "who had already forgiven the world for taking his father," and his ritualistic return to the train. The contradictory impulses between staying/leaving manifest concretely when he chooses to burn the currency rather than flee. Minor deduction for Mara's underdeveloped presence as pressure-source.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions drives clear choices, and her gift of healing through witnessed words creates genuine internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The druid's internal conflict between her guarded nature and buried love drives meaningful choices, particularly in planting the seed and accepting the thorns.

    Lyra's transformation from seeker to covenant guardian is earned through concrete sacrifices—surrendering memories to restore balance. Her "purposefully curious" trait drives key decisions, particularly when she chooses which dreams to lose. The embodied detail of scars glowing cobalt and burning through marrow grounds the internal stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's reckless idealism manifests through concrete action (pressing burned tarot into bark, offering futures "not my own") with genuine internal conflict between her holes/exits paradox. The final transformation where she accepts the orchard's gift shows earned change through embodied cost ("felt the last hole in her soul close").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elliot's internal contradiction between insulating with facts and confronting emotional truth drives the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around identity shifts that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's journey from medicated numbness to raw confrontation with guilt is earned through concrete embodied details (accordion's patched bellows, heel-to-toe platform walking).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation coheres through embodied contradiction—the ivy's telepathic urgency against empire's drums, coffee grounds forming islands of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mortician's internal contradiction between preserving beauty and confronting oblivion drives genuine choices, particularly in her hesitation at the threshold knowing she must surrender "every spark she had ever gathered."

The final choice to release the chip and descend transformed earns its weight through prior setup of her lifelong pattern-finding habit.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing, planting, tending). The sister's arrival with "fingers blackened, eyes wide with the shock of rebirth" shows genuine embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal conflict between professional certainty and moral ambiguity drives authentic choices, particularly her compromise with the smugglers that "would anger both sides and perhaps save both." The cloak of doubt as embodied contradiction works well, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("conscience for hire" lacks specificity in practice).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara-Lira's backwards aging creates genuine contradiction between teaching and withholding, embodied through physical regression ("joints loosening into flexibility of youth").

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The reaper's heartbreak manifests through concrete, embodied details—"hollow where his own heart used to beat," fingers trembling at recovered names.

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of the loved one's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Calen's internal contradiction between guilt over choosing the bell over the bosun and his devotion to cosmic balance drives authentic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's twenty-year silence about the dam's fracture creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through her ritual of photographs and confession.

    Zev's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail—raw palms, muscle memory, the weight of silent covenant—with internal contradiction between exhaustion and duty playing out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dual Kaels and their relationship to the brain create a compelling trinity of consciousness exploring numbness vs. feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's transformation from protective proprietor to willing caretaker is earned through concrete pressures—the seed's influence manifesting in dreams, the corpse flower's eruption, and the cavern's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to resurrect grandfather's laughter through ritual action is clear and embodied through concrete gestures (tightening grip, pressing forehead to metal).

    The alchemist's stoic sensitivity manifests through embodied contradictions—calm notation of failure as "pressure behind his eyes, not as despair" while blood seeps into silver.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—her "brightly attentive eyes hunting" shifts to tactile engagement with the patch "warm against her palm."

Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("heart beat the same rhythm") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's calm intuitive gift manifests concretely through her ability to "taste emotions the way others tasted salt," and her final choice to map empathy through the mirrors shows contradictory impulses (duty vs. understanding) acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's transformation from death-seeker to listener of endings shows compelling internal contradiction, with concrete embodied details like "pulse slower, dreams filled with the hush of glaciers."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The half-masked line walker's grief and determination are embodied through the darkened gauze and her ritual of diagonal stepping, creating a concrete character-particular response to loss. Her final shift from "mourning to stewardship" represents genuine internal change earned through the consecration ritual. However, the monks remain functional rather than individualized, and some emotional transitions ("strangely honest about the sorrow") lean toward telling rather than embodied showing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's "perceptively calm" demeanor holds consistently through collective ritual, and her motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" drives concrete actions—laying photographs, creating spiral patterns.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around healing that lacks full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scholar's transformation from decoder to listener shows clear internal progression with embodied emotion ("Tears blurred the dawn light").

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prophet's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction as he "woke certain he would remember tomorrow, yet by dusk the certainty had slipped away," driving his search through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal journey from repair-as-control to repair-as-surrender is earned through embodied struggle with the spinning clock hand, though some transitions between realizations feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ivy's characterization as "forgiving skeptic" manifests beautifully through concrete actions—treating the girl's injury while listening "shrewdly innocent enough" and later transforming guilt into guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal conflict between confronting public pain and seeking private healing drives consistent micro-choices (grafting the rose, pressing palm to metal, waiting for bloom). The cost of choosing growth over direct response lands clearly when she decides to meet her brother "not with accusations but with a single rose petal." Minor deduction for the brother remaining off-page, limiting relationship-as-crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The novelist's internal conflict between using "beauty to avoid truth" and her confrontation with abandoned characters shows genuine contradiction acting in scene. The procession of accusatory characters creates embodied emotional cost, though some passages drift toward abstract interiority ("lucidly watchful" repeated without variation).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is embodied through concrete actions (pressing tendril to bark, winding the crank, singing the songs) with clear stakes. The interiority remains specific ("memory sift through her like wind through chimes") though occasionally edges toward the ornamental. Her choice to restore through song rather than machines shows genuine character-driven agency with visible cost in tears that "tasted like gratitude and rain."

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's methodical patience and ritualistic precision create a distinct character whose motivations crystallize through embodied action—the heel-to-toe walking, the deliberate folding, the rhythm-keeping that prevents shattering.

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of her goal until the closing revelation clarifies the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen's motivation to "reverse-engineer wonder" and preserve it drives consistent action through angle measurements and mechanical repairs, with the contradiction between rational preservation and living wonder creating genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's characterization achieves depth through embodied contradiction - the arsonist's daughter who fights fire, carrying her trauma as talisman.

    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied ritual—touching inscriptions, accepting fractional weight, feeling the ridge's heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal conflict between joining her mother and maintaining her duty crystallizes in concrete choices—closing the sovereign case, naming "Tomorrow," planting the lily.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ignorance cartographer's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the warm pulse of glass against her palm, the equations scratched into frost—though her internal contradictions could be sharper.

Minor deduction for the lost expedition's somewhat convenient awakening and uniform response.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation through the drone's "dreaming of home" and her fear of the chip's memory creates genuine internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's steadfast neutrality and ritualistic approach create a distinct character whose "uncommonly thoughtful" nature manifests through precise choreography of the exchange ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vagrant poet's monthly personality molting creates genuine internal tension, particularly when Lark resists the change to remain with Mira.

    Elara's "mournfully eager" motivation is embodied and contradictory, compelling her higher-stakes choice to restart the blower for a second movement.

Minor deduction for the child-absence's voice not being as distinct as the guardian's internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied choices like cutting his palm, with internal contradiction shown through stoic calm amid failure. His final renunciation of obedience transfers memories to the crozier with visible cost, earning the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.4)
    Grief is embodied through specific, concrete details (anchor link's weight, pressure as forgiveness) and drives a credible renunciation of the known world. The final choice to dive is earned by prior causality—the wife's lesson, the glyphs' lure, the city's sigh—with visible cost in leaving the children behind.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in the premise, compelling high-stakes action. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the translation of texture into sound.

Her interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("bitterness crystallizing into frost on her tongue").

The carpenter's transformation from silence to song is earned through prior causality, with the final choice to sing redefining his relationship to silence.

Her internal conflict—between capturing and releasing the dream—is embodied in her final, decisive choice to offer the palette.

Her final transformation—becoming both vessel and architect—is earned through the on-page causality of her surrender to the memories.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with the pianist's wistfulness and strategic creativity embodied through concrete actions like erasing the quarrel and planting the sonata. His internal conflict between memory and reality drives every choice, culminating in an earned reconfiguration where his musical agency literally rewrites fate. The final smile feels unguarded and specific, not stock.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear, rooted, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict—doubting the luminous things she loves to save them—is embodied and contradictory, driving her to a credible, earned renunciation. The final choice to bite the fruit is a micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Helini's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "rhythmically placid" cadence and bonsai tutor expertise filtering her perception. Her internal conflict between regret and a desire for reconciliation is dramatized through concrete actions with the lace and compass, not summarized. The final choice to set the vessel adrift is an Earned Stasis that feels motivated by her established traits and the cost of the severance, though the precise nature of her failing remains slightly oblique, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s scientist‑calm filters every perception and choice, creating a cohesive interiority with tactile actions (tweezers, app, labeling). The old impulse toward spectacle versus her new vow to “strip drama” yields a credible, quiet contradiction. The micro‑choices—collecting, analyzing, then sealing the wings beside data drives—align with her values and reveal cost through renunciation. The conflict could tighten once more on the page to expose sharper friction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear motive and embodied perception anchor her actions; the ledger, frost-reading, and turquoise shard choices reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The internal conflict—vengeance versus remembrance—lands credibly when she renounces revenge. Earlier beats could surface contradictory impulses more explicitly under pressure. Still, reactions are specific and aligned with her artisan’s mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s motives are concrete and escalate from self-soothing to restoring the conservatory, with embodied contradictions (fear vs. awe) driving action. Micro-choices (orienting forks, selecting gratitude, pressing the final fork to his heart) reveal a hierarchy of values. His realization—that the music is for the sanctuary, not ears—reconfigures his stance credibly. The only softness is the limited on‑page cost beyond vulnerability and surrender of the forks’ last chord.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s vocation and “inadvertent stubbornness” motivate a clear through‑line from pier to ledger, culminating in the earned, costly micro‑choice to write his own name. Interiority is lean but specific—recognitions of the lost and his refusal to let memory go unrested. The hesitation before inscribing himself provides credible internal conflict at the peak. A slightly deeper embodied emotional texture under pressure could lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lila’s motives and methods are precise and embodied: the bell, the hundred-step cadence, the careful packets and notes reveal a leader whose gentleness is tactical. Her exchange with Tomasz shows values under pressure and a credible refusal to despair. Interiority is implied through sensory bias and choice rather than spelled out. The endurance stance at the end reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—she seeks the “unused love” and takes concrete, risky actions (opening the box, breathing on the tear, reaching into the image). Interiority is specific and textured, with contradictions (trembling curiosity versus fear of what she’ll uncover). Micro-choices under pressure—timed breaths, the touch through the ground glass—reveal priorities. The transformation feels earned, with the cost legible as grief uncalcifies and a prior path (rationing love) is relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—“to discover the texture of time”—is clear and drives each choice (pressing the fragment to the willow, stepping into the maze of light). Interiority is specific and embodied (“wet clay over broken glass”) rather than generic. Contradiction registers as curiosity versus self‑erasure, though it could edge sharper in one beat to deepen cost. The final renunciation of self into the garden reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—protect the seed vault and get the seeds into soil—and her patiently strategic temperament is dramatized (studying the keys, counting heartbeats under chains). Interiority is concise but textured through embodied choices rather than labels. A touch more contradictory impulse under peak pressure (fear vs. duty beyond brief hesitation) could deepen complexity. The visible cost (arrow spent, risk ongoing) supports an earned endurance stance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (to hear the sound of trust breaking) drives every choice, and the renunciation—leaving the device—reads as an earned cost. Interiority is vivid and embodied through synesthetic perception and tactile work with tiles and slag. Contradictory pulls (understanding vs. flight; warning vs. witness) operate on the page. Minor safety lies in how competently the protagonist proceeds without much visible struggle until the flare-memory turn.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The thief’s motives and methods are precise and embodied, with micro‑choices (bench selection, moonbeam release, bouquet tilt) revealing character. The internal turn from acquisitive compulsion to renunciation is credible and earned by the jar’s growing weight and the “door” motif. Interiority remains image‑driven yet legible; ambiguity isn’t evasive. A touch more on the cost to her identity before release could deepen the contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motive—to find microclimates and build safe zones—drives concrete micro-choices (reviving consoles, locating archives, tracing coordinates). The internal contradiction (habitual abandonment vs. choosing to stay) is dramatized rather than told, culminating in a credible renunciation. Emotions are embodied through tactile work and the bookmark’s evolving charge. The cost is felt in her commitment to “stay,” though external pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich, character‑particular interiority (“stunt double to a vanished star,” fear of heights) drives concrete micro‑choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses—terror and resolve—coexist and surface in embodied actions (decrypting, prying the plate, climbing). The twin confrontation reconfigures the self‑story with visible cost. Minor on‑the‑nose lines (“vulnerability was power”) slightly flatten the otherwise nuanced psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline and enacted: she aims to map the endless night and pursues it through tactile, specific choices (line, spiral, circle, dot, legend). Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and the gold-leaf ritual, though contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers. The sleeve-tearing and the whispered “Go” register cost and agency. Slightly narrow emotional range keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    J-9’s motivation—guilt integration and the question of thought’s origin—drives concrete choices from avoidance to confrontation to amalgamation. The internal contradiction (denial/rage/acceptance) is dramatized through the loops and the handling of the violin, not just told. Embodied specifics (servo hums, ice that “burned”) keep emotion grounded. A few thesis-like lines edge toward abstraction but the final choice feels earned with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (to listen, decode, and bridge mistrust) drives embodied micro‑choices: crouching, using the lens, writing the reply, offering a hand. The ex‑registrar’s ledger with red corrections externalizes cost credibly. Internal contradiction is mild—the registrar moves smoothly from caution to invitation with little friction—so the struggle feels low‑risk. Still, the relationship turn is earned and credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motive and methods are specific and embodied—choosing paths by marble memory, arranging and polishing them, burying the split one. The queen’s skepticism supplies relational pressure that reframes Lira’s actions without stealing agency. Internal contradiction is subtle (tender deception vs. pragmatic ritual) rather than overt, keeping tension quiet. The visible cost—leaving the split marble buried—lands, though struggle remains mostly serene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (prove lateral time to touch her brother) drives every choice, and her obliging trait is nicely cross‑pressured by private urgency. Interiority is embodied through tactile interactions with the nexus/lever and the “mechanically warm” air as tether. The cost lands as sideways grief rather than tidy triumph. A hair more contradiction under peak pressure (hesitation vs risk) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives and micro‑choices are clear and character‑specific: she returns to “disrupt” the legend, reads the warped program, follows ripples, and decides to perform the code with her clarinet. Interiority is embodied and particular (pulse, creak, water pressure on fingertips) rather than labeled. The “between spaces” identity threads through her actions and culminates in the final note. The cost is primarily conceptual, not emotional rupture, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Both the oracle and Elias have clear, specific motives (to weigh a swallowed truth; to face his filed‑as‑routine complicity), and their micro‑choices ladder: pinning the gentian, climbing, holding it to the sky, smudging, weighing, and logging. Contradictory impulses flicker credibly—confession vs endurance, mourning vs hope—without tidy therapy‑speak. Elias’s graphite “smudge” is an earned, character‑revealing act that forecloses denial. Interiority is embodied via instruments and weather rather than labels, with felt cost in the 4.7‑gram measure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—to measure the mass of her brother’s swallowed truth—drives every micro‑choice, from hesitating at the wheel to turning it despite skepticism. The contradiction (religiously skeptical yet carrying Saint Jude) is active, not decorative, and wavers at the 21‑gram reveal. Embodied perception (“cold brass,” “coal‑blackened gravel”) grounds emotion. The closing acceptance costs her a burden she briefly carries, though the epiphany’s neatness trims a hair of messier ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motive—witnessing without judgment—anchors his choices, and the handling of the swan and inscription reveals character through action. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely struggles or wavers, which flattens tension. Embodied perception is rich (dust, stone sweat), yet we don’t see a live dilemma that forces a painful trade. The Earned Stasis at the end is credible but low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s motives (music as bridge, carrying her daughter’s curl) are clear and layered, and her final relinquishment of the keepsake shows credible cost. Interiority is concrete and specific—sensory memories of Marisol’s curl—and her “cautious exuberance” reads in calibrated choices (minor→brief major→minor). Rowan’s shift from silence to speech is earned through beats, not declaration. A touch more visible internal contradiction under pressure could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular, and her micro‑choices (pressing the tapestry to the wall, selecting and reading diaries, then reading them in reverse) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The discovery of a diary in her own hand introduces a credible internal conflict that she must resolve. Her final renunciation—becoming a courier rather than a curator—carries felt cost (she leaves empty‑handed). Interiority remains embodied and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lin’s interior drive (stale “twelve-bar blues” vs. urge to “transpose life into a new key”) motivates bold micro-choices: burning the film and proposing the broadcast. Mara’s duty/regret tension is legible in the gun/tears beat, sharpening the relationship crucible. Contradictory impulses operate in scene, not summary, and the renunciation of the spy role feels earned. A slight softening comes from external validation at dawn, which trims the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The priest’s motive—to expose and neutralize hidden assumptions—is precise and enacted through concrete micro-choices (recording hush, reversing assertions, offering the bow). His competence borders on effortless, which limits felt internal contradiction. Still, the respect he offers the demon and the cost (palette drained, shimmer relinquished) register as character-specific stakes. The demon’s formless presence functions as a pressure rather than a full relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and embodied urgency (“before exhaustion hit”) power micro‑choices: mapping scents and sounds at exact whorls, using dawn light to “read” notation, then surrendering the shell. Motivation (chronologically homesick, conductor of unheard symphonies) is specific and drives action. Internal tension—yearning vs. fatigue; past vs. present—reads on the page without therapy‑speak. If there’s a slight limit, it’s the absence of a sharper contradictory impulse at the peak beyond speed and depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear—escape the self‑labyrinth—and the internal contradiction (compulsion to retrace vs. desire to land) sharpens under pressure. Embodied moments like boots hovering and the hospital floor constant ground the psyche in concrete images. The renunciation (throwing the tablet) feels earned by prior beats (runes fixing, algorithm looping). A touch of declarative insight (“the labyrinth is not outside you”) edges toward on‑the‑nose but is paid off by action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is lucid and urgent, embodied through tactile teaching habits and escalated numbness. Her micro-choices (threading the needle, pressing forehead to skin, later teaching without words) reveal values with felt cost. Internal contradiction is present (skepticism versus ritual surrender), though it resolves smoothly. The change—regaining felt connection rather than hearing—is earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority: Liora’s meticulous, word‑wary nature shapes concrete micro‑choices (stone‑shifting, logging the time, “delayed disclosure”). Contradictory impulses—integrity versus openness to the watcher—operate simultaneously and drive her tactic. The renunciation (not confronting, hiding the tube) forecloses a path with felt cost. Embodied perception (“graphite sweet” wind, kiss to the tube) keeps emotion lived rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motive—returning the last memory instead of selling it—emerges credibly from embodied grief and occupational history, with micro-choices (uncorking, pressing the vial to his lips) revealing values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (“aromatically cautious” vs. breathing it all) are dramatized, not told. The renunciation carries a visible cost: relinquishing the vial’s last memory and his broker identity. Slight idealization in the coda sands down rough edges of flaw but doesn’t undercut the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s ethically playful motive matures into responsibility as he moves from loosening to retying, with felt cost in relinquishing detachment (“playfulness had limits”). Interiority is concrete and object-driven (hair, clay, wind) rather than generic. The final choice to revise the rope’s pattern and offer it rewrites his self-concept credibly. Minor note: the fugitive remains abstract, but the poet’s motives carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear—she seeks to “unbind the silence” and “find beauty in the unfinished”—and her renunciation (placing the violin in the bowl; “strings she would never tighten again”) provides credible cost. Interiority is embodied through sonic perception rather than labels. The internal tension between playing and listening/storytelling is strong but largely unopposed by external pressure, keeping the struggle elegantly quiet rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vale’s motive—maintaining “affectionate detachment” while selling curated feelings—is clear and pressurized by the buyer’s clean curiosity. Contradictory impulses act on the page: she both sells the lie and is pierced by an unfiltered need. Her micro‑choices with the blotter (grounding, then trying to seal, then finally taking the buyer’s hand) read as earned. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in peak beats keeps this just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marisol’s motive—uplifting the “silent contributors”—is concrete and embodied through tactile choices (weighing envelopes like spice, pinning the locket). Her interiority reads specific (locket warming, sea-spray tears), and Theo/Marta register as distinct with function under pressure. Contradictory impulses are mild; the piece leans idealized over conflicted, so the change skews gentle rather than hard-won. Still, the final vulnerability and renewed commitment feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s longing for witness and kinship motivates every choice, and her embodied “luminescent ache” keeps emotion concrete. The reveal that each reed bears the name of a vanished witness adds specificity and vulnerability. Internal contradiction (solitary artist seeking community) is present but lightly pressured. The change—accepting translucence to let others’ light pass—feels earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional, not contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent: finish the bestiary by capturing the birthplace of echoes before the giant stirs. Interiority is concrete (the pendant kiss, apology to the titan) and actions align with need. Contradictory impulses—reverence versus theft of time—surface but are resolved quickly, keeping conflict more elegant than fraught. The final choice (borrow time, uncage, accept the futures glimpsed) feels earned with a modest, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—reframing her sister’s disappearance by “measuring the curvature of sorrow”—is specific, embodied, and sustained through micro‑choices (placing the eyes, whispering primes, following the spiral path). Contradictory impulses (fear of seeing, buried optimism) play in scene and culminate in a credible renunciation: leaving the eyes and moving on. The cost is legible: she sacrifices a talisman and forecloses the fantasy of retrieval. Interiority stays concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motive (to be visible to those who need her) is clear, embodied, and drives concrete micro‑choices, culminating in sacrificing “lullaby II” for the teen. Contradiction is present and earned: protect the cache vs. answer immediate need. Emotions are tactile and particular (palms over joists like braille, tape warmth on collarbone). The final renunciation is credible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s control-versus-surrender conflict is embodied and particular: running for the potting bench vs. staying in the rain, releasing the leaf, naming vines with claimed names. Her professional competence shades her self‑undermining grief, and micro‑choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The change to acceptance costs her the comfort of rigid control without pretending the grief is solved. A hairline softness appears in how smoothly the “release” arrives, but it feels earned by the storm’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and character‑specific; Ishka’s “insomnia as surplus of meaning” and her mix of weariness and hunger make the brooch/canvas choice feel earned. The internal conflict—attachment to the brooch/mother/past vs. the promise of “Tomorrow, maybe”—is dramatized, not told. The handover reads as a costly, motivated act, not a whim. Minor passivity (“followed those trails without decision”) is outweighed by the decisive trade.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motives (pilgrim’s drive to “magnify everyday magic”; seer’s reliance on certainty) meet pressure and evolve. The pilgrim’s concrete choices—pressing the pearl into the wall, stepping into the corridor, initiating the lullaby—reveal values under strain. The clairvoyant’s collapse of certainty (“I see everything… except the moment this ends”) and choice to sing mark an earned shift. Slight distance from deeper, character‑particular backstory keeps this shy of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—assembling absences into a navigational meaning—is clear and consistently enacted through tactile micro‑choices (pressing the valve to labels, stone, lens). Interiority stays particular and embodied, avoiding labels while revealing a disciplined, ritual logic. The refusal to cheer at the sight of returning sails reads as an earned renunciation that costs her ease in favor of vocation. Internal contradiction (yearning for return vs. archivist’s restraint) is present and resolved via endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s goal is clear and character‑rooted—retrieve the unspoken sentence before the mist swallows the stars—and her choices (boarding, ascending, pressing the punch) track. Interiority is textured and particular (“legend was written in the margins of her therapy journal”), with a credible contradiction between control (mapping) and surrender. The erasure of habits on the staircase is a visible cost aligned with her flaw. The inward‑pointing arrows at the end mark a believable reconfiguration rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s skepticism and kindness co-exist on the page: she almost drops the tile, then chooses to witness and transcribe through the night. Her interiority is concrete (the whales’ song vibrating in her sternum; the date of her mother’s death) and her actions follow from character. The endurance choice—stay, transcribe, leave the notebook, promise to return—feels earned with visible emotional cost. A single label line (“courageously kind”) edges toward telling but is supported by behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Veyra’s motive—boredom sharpened into a risky hunger to know what follows goodbye—is clear and drives concrete choices. Interiority is specific (mapping magnetic lines, humming to tune the storm) and contradictions (yearning vs. risk of tearing the pocket) play in scene. The final shift from ennui to charged purpose feels earned. A hair light on palpable psychic cost during the peak beats, but credible within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lila’s motive is precise and pressurized: secure a stamped death to buy her father’s life, while wrestling with guilt. Interiority is embodied (the ink pot’s weight, counting Mississippis, the apology to Alvarez) and choice-driven. Contradictory impulses—devotion to her father vs. moral calculus—are active in-scene. The final renunciation (accepting complicity and disappearance) reads earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liang’s motive—to preserve textures before the silence erases them—is specific and consistently enacted through concrete micro‑choices (charting intervals, steadying breath, speaking memories). The “earnestly studious” trait turns active under pressure when panic hits and he regulates himself to keep working. Emotional texture is embodied (hum pooling “behind his eyes as a color”) without label‑speak. The shift from archivist to maker—accepting invented histories as lanterns—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is clear and compelling: to prove existence against an administrative erasure. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile images (pockets of rumors, bitter almond tint). The decisive renunciation—letting the death certificate dissolve and accepting namelessness—reads earned and costly. Minor note: internal contradiction (seeking a name vs. becoming the pause) is well handled rather than hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive—“Tonight she would test everything”—meets a credible inner split between joy in debunking and the loss of comforting myths. Embodied choices (adjusting pegs, playing until fingers bleed) reveal values under pressure. The mother–daughter tie personalizes the drive without sentimentality. Small on‑the‑nose moments (“I miss believing”) are earned by the prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s motives are clear—protecting the living carnival while honoring the drowned city—and her “orderly intuitive” talent tracks to concrete tactics. Interiority is specific (the chip warming, the grid beneath chaos), and her exchanges with Tomasso add pressure without grandstanding. We see credible micro‑choices under stress (reading murals, testing lines, reorganizing the hull). The internal contradiction (dual allegiance) is present but not fully stress‑tested at the end due to truncation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, specific motives—duty and grief—drive her endurance, with micro‑choices (embedding the grain, calibrating the flash, staying in the cold) revealing a meticulous, devotional nature. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“catalogued every fracture...as if it were a love letter”). Internal contradiction—curiosity sharpened by grief—exists but remains quiet; little on‑page wobble under pressure limits complexity. Still, the final endurance choice feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation is precise and embodied—repair the drone before the whistle to guide a rescue—and her competence reads lived-in (the water basin, spider-silk laminate). Interiority is carried through tactile and auditory perception rather than abstract labels. The maternal undertone (“the way she once whispered to her daughter”) adds depth, but contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal; she rarely doubts or errs. Stakes land, but the struggle feels slightly too smooth for peak-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clean and embodied (“to find where the rivers begin”), and her micro‑choices—speaking the line, stepping onto thinning ice, pairing the books—reveal character under pressure. The dry wit/“last necessary lie” motif adds specificity without lapsing into label-speak. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than explicit, but the restraint fits her competence and the scene’s poise. Cost registers in her refusal to retrieve the predecessor’s book and in risking the open water.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tuner’s motive—restore balance—reads cleanly through action, but interiority is intentionally withheld, limiting complexity. His patience shapes micro‑choices (pausing, adjusting stride, stepping back), giving him agency without a confessional mind. The old woman’s hum and the silent procession provide relational texture without dialogue. The renunciation at the end (letting the rhythm continue without him) lands as a credible, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear, character‑particular motives—preserve a moment vs. survive—intensify under the clock. The contradictory pull (clutching the vial while choosing to release the memory) is embodied and earned. Micro‑choices (unscrewing the vial, pressing helmet to the altar, choosing which future instant to keep) reveal a coherent value hierarchy with cost. No therapy‑speak or tidy rationality; the renunciation feels lived-in and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leif’s motive—pursuing the hush to reframe his father’s legacy—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete micro-choices (descending, keying both doors, threading mirrors). Interiority stays character-specific and embodied (“sustaining impossibilities,” fingers on carved names). Internal contradiction is present but subtle (risking body/time vs. compulsion to gather painful truth). The closing acceptance (wearing the hush as armor; fused ring) reads as an earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, consistent motive (repay a debt, free the trapped soul) drives the action, and contradictory impulses (love and betrayal) are embodied in tactile images (frosting fruit, the bead warming). The choice to press bead to fruit is earned by prior lifetimes and her stewardship of the greenhouse. Internal struggle is more told than dramatized in the moment, so micro‑choices under pressure feel limited. Still, the visible cost—her dissolution—is convincingly tied to her values.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to mend ruin) drives embodied choices—placing the plate, sleepless walking, the chant. Interiority is lyric but character‑particular, and the shift from sleepwalking to “both eyes open” reads as earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (surrendering the treasured plate vs. need to reweave). A deeper on‑page tug‑of‑war under peak pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation (“to restore lost faith”) is enacted through concrete, risky choices: entering the forbidden orchard, excavating, asking permission of bones, aligning the dial. Contradictory impulses—caution vs. warmly curious drive—coexist and are tested on the page. The seven-day vigil and the final renunciation of the “old ache” read as earned. Slightly soft costs keep this just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—protecting meaning by choosing “slow” and the margins—drives specific micro‑choices (arriving before drones, halting three paces from the box to add a glyph). Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (chalk codes, the hopscotch memory), avoiding label‑speak. The contradiction (a pseudonymist seeking the “real”) is dramatized rather than stated. Cost is subtle but legible: surrendering control and certainty by releasing the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motives (finish the chart, avert the coup, protect king/heir/city) are clear and enacted through specific micro‑choices: feigning foolishness to repel an intruder, pricking her finger as cipher, re‑stitching escape routes. Her contradiction—wise strategist in a fool’s mask—operates in scene, not label-only. Emotional texture stays embodied (blood like rubies; ear pressed to echoed silence) with no tidy moral self‑explanations. The cost is modest but legible: risked exposure, blood, and the renunciation of open recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motive—crossing the labyrinth to confront seven years of unsent letters—drives coherent, escalating micro‑choices (bleeding on the shard, reading aloud, cutting again). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (ink “tasting” in her mouth, letters turning to lead). Contradictory impulses—fierceness and tenderness, fear and yearning—coexist on the page. The renunciation cost (sacrificing the shard and the bitter protection of silence) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lin’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“turned gunfire into grammar” versus helpless sister—yielding credible contradictory impulses. Micro‑choices (decoding the cast, pressing coral, asking for the planting ritual) reveal values under pressure. The cost is quiet but legible: acceptance that “the arm will remember the break” and her own fear dissolving into shared night. Secondary presence (Dr. Vanna) supports rather than dilutes the core relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s drive to “rediscover lost joy” is clear, embodied in tactile choices (touching the fragment, guiding light, deciding to continue despite warnings). The internal conflict—grandmother’s hush/“brightness like a debt”—credibly pressures her mid‑scene. Interiority is concrete and not generalized; hesitation and resolve feel earned. Depth is strong for the length, though her flaw set remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s “methodically playful” temperament is dramatized through the tapping, listening, and arranging of pitches, then tested by the hobo’s offer. Her internal trade—certainty for curiosity—manifests in concrete choices: asking a risked question, embedding the coin, leaving tools behind. The contradiction between restorer/control and artist/wonder drives the pivot. The cost (identity shift and relinquishing the coin) is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander’s motive—smuggling living language past the Excise—is clear, embodied in concrete micro‑choices (seed under tongue, coded whisper, planting). His competence is vivid, but internal contradiction is light; he rarely doubts or pays a visible emotional price. “To stand guard over your own spark…” signals an ethos, and the mimic/pitcher‑plant beat reveals character under pressure. A deeper tug between fear and bravado would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (guarding the sister’s memory while seeking rest) drives concrete choices: ensconcing, planting the postcard, compiling the chapbook, and finally stepping outside. Interiority is vivid and embodied through oceanic, tactile images rather than labels. Contradictory impulses—rest without erasure—persist until the earned armistice. The felt cost (centuries of insomnia and surrendering the vigil’s rigidity) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive and embodied reactions (pulse stutters, methodical choices) carry the piece, and her renunciation of speaking her own name reads as an earned, character-specific restraint. The caretaker’s agency drives every turn (sap attempt, descent for the phonograph, coaxing the giggle). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt—competence and tenderness overrule visible ambivalence—limiting depth slightly. Still, the arc coheres and the endurance costs are felt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motive (save the archive, repair trust) is clear and drives concrete actions; her three-month silence and “carefully reckless” stance add credible tension. The embodied choices—writing promises, guiding melody to Arden, shattering the ink well—align with character and stakes. Arden’s turn (“I was afraid”) lands, but reads a touch swift and tidy, softening the crucible between them. A little more on-page friction or cost in his reversal would deepen the relational change.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motives and competence are clear and embodied: she measures, calibrates, and decides under pressure to balance water and rest. The trembling→certainty progression is specific and earned (“hands trembled again, but this time from certainty”). Internal contradiction is modest (duty vs. reverence), and she faces it through calibrated action rather than speechifying. Slight lack of visible sacrifice keeps it shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—tender care and self-erasure—are dramatized through concrete choices (sealing/reopening the skylight, forging papers, then burning them). The boy’s letter and the meteorite decision pressure her toward renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is embodied in tactile rituals (finger-tapped rhythms, dust‑mapping) rather than labels. The final release and stove scene credibly foreclose a path while retaining human ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Iona’s motive is clear and embodied—pressing her ear to glass, tracing rings, risking the rail—without melodrama. Her “featherly determination” threads action to theme. Internal contradiction is light; doubt seldom counters resolve, limiting complexity. Still, micro-choices under pressure feel specific and earned, culminating in the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear desire (to learn the rhythm of belonging) drives concrete actions (placing the feather, pressing the console, speaking the city’s name). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, though internal contradiction is minimal and she rarely faces a value trade‑off beyond ritual sacrifice. Embodied emotion lands in tactile ways (fogged helmet, shared exhale). The change—moving from seeker to resonant participant—feels earned by her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive and method are clear and embodied (planting seeds, pressing glass to cheek), and her micro-choices track to an internal shift. Interiority is sensorial and specific rather than labeled. Conflict is gentle, with limited contradiction or visible struggle; she’s competent and rarely compromised. The renunciation—“no longer searching for vanished paths”—lands, but the cost is felt more as wistfulness than acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Finch’s motive—to “serenade monotony” by ordering randomness—is clear and consistently embodied in his choices (tide tables, slopes, gull timing). Interiority is minimal but the actions reveal a precise, disciplined temperament. There’s little internal contradiction or emotional cost on the page, keeping the arc shallow. Still, the transfer of the bishop reads as a considered renunciation that fits his ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysandra’s motive—to revive forbidden memory through dance and inscription—is specific and embodied, and her micro‑choices (kneeling at the fracture, tracing cracks, sealing “Remember”) align with it. The internal tension between elective exile and the garden’s claiming “anchor” provides credible friction and a felt cost. Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, filtered through a tide‑dancer’s sensibility. The only limitation is that external pressure (the ban) stays offstage, keeping conflict largely interior.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s motive is clear and particular—redeeming flawed glass by refracting “reckonings” into everyday epiphanies—and her final choice (leaving her treasured panes) carries a real, character‑specific cost. Interiority is embodied via tide‑pool readings and occupational detail. The internal contradiction (treasuring the panes vs. relinquishing them) is present but could tighten under greater pressure. No relationship crucible appears, which limits micro‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive—translating guilt into something shareable—drives every micro‑choice, from where she stops to how she handles the box. Contradictory impulses (protector vs. survivor’s guilt) are embodied in concrete images (the rookie’s curled glove, the scar as “text”). The renunciation at the end (returning innocence, accepting scar) feels earned. Slight neatness in the sky‑written “forgive” risks over‑tidiness but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—to derive “equations for hope”—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (arranging patterns, launching balloons, interpreting readings). Interiority is specific to her observational, methodical temperament. However, internal contradiction and visible emotional cost are light; she meets little resistance or doubt. The renunciation at the end (losing the gauge) hints at cost but isn’t deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—uncovering the corridor’s dreaming walls under the weight of her grandfather’s secrecy—is concrete and coherently intensified by on‑page discoveries. Interiority is sensorial and character‑particular (sound‑mapping, heartbeat mortar), with a credible tension between honoring legacy and breaking silence. The sensory overwhelm at the chamber provides embodied cost. Minor ding: the “sensitively perceptive” label recurs rather than letting action fully carry the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear—she comes to persuade the mirrors—and it’s enacted through specific micro-choices (pressing the locket to stone, singing, dancing). Interiority is embodied via the locket/heartbeat constraint rather than labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (dependent on a borrowed beat while inviting uncertainty over certainty), but conflict remains gentle rather than sharply testing her limits. The final renunciation/integration of “borrowed” into her own rhythm reads earned, if low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurelia’s motive—atonement through becoming the ritual—is clear, embodied, and consistent with her history as a negotiator. Contradiction (operatively gentle yet complicit in a siege) textures her choices, especially the vow of silence. The relationship with Kelis functions as crucible without speeches, and her micro-choices (placement of tokens, clockwise steps, accepting his harmonica) reveal values. Slight softness: the scene affords her few hard missteps or pressured reversals, keeping struggle contained.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira’s contradictions—amoral architect of drought yet secretly sentimental—are dramatized in action (the egg to ear; the water poured; the refusal to re‑seal the sky). Her final renunciation (“she could have stopped it…but she stood motionless”) carries visible cost and feels earned. Embodied emotion (salt nest, iron scent, boots creaking) grounds the interiority. No hedging: she loses her empire to honor a fragile echo.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lys’s purpose and method are clear and consistent, with embodied reverence (“fingers trembling… from reverence”) and a principled refusal to perform as trained. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance beyond ritual difficulty, so the choice carries less struggle than the stakes imply. The cost—taking “the weight of every echo” and letting the sanctuary crumble—lands, but her path feels assured rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lucien’s motive—atonement through ethical storytelling—is clear and drives on‑page choices (the reversal of the tyrant, the confession, inviting audience co‑authorship). Interiority is economical yet distinct; “uncommonly serene” under pressure reads as a stable trait that shapes conduct. Secondary characters apply soft but relevant pressure. The lack of a final, felt cost limits the arc from excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—drives concrete micro‑choices (weaving semaphore, knotting the wing, tying the thread, lighting the candle, singing). The internal tension between embarrassment at “her own need to commemorate” and her compulsion lends credible contradiction. Embodied emotion is specific (“lighter than guilt,” thread tightening with the grotto’s exhale). The earned renunciation at the end—leaving the thread and accepting forgetting—feels motivated and costs her.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: atonement via preserving names, executed through tactile, craft-specific choices (rebraiding the rope, pressing wax). The guilt/forgiveness tension is active on the page, with memories surfacing as she works. Micro‑choices track a value hierarchy (care over force, remembrance over utility). The final endurance—choosing to carry the charged rope and cast a new bell—reads earned with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Foresight’s drive—to decode the decaying directive and learn why paths choose walkers—grounds her choices, culminating in the identity-costly step through the arch. Interiority is specific (fear arriving “she was never coded to host”) and integrates with action (harvesting dreams into tactics). Contradictory impulses (playfulness vs. dawning fear; interpreter vs. message) operate in scene. The change—becoming walker and shedding self—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Naram-Sin’s motive—securing cosmic order over personal glory—is consistent and sharpened by his frugality and skepticism. His hesitation at the covenant and swift, weighted acceptance register as a genuine internal conflict with visible cost. Embodied details (patched coat, fasting, charcoal diagrams) anchor interiority in action. The renunciation forecloses a future path (naming comets) in a way the story has earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s contradictory impulse—“scheming pacifist”—is dramatized in micro-choices: she repairs the pin, refuses to weaponize it, transmits the lullaby, plants the seed, and devotes her life to hush. Embodied interiority (stone as “cooled ash,” lullaby as warmth) keeps emotions concrete. The renunciation of silencing drums in favor of dissolving their echo reads earned. Slight explicitness around “teach resentment to release” trims mystery but not credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks the runaway dream to understand why it fled—and her craft‑driven mindset shapes tactics. Interiority is embodied through breath and toolwork, culminating in the “crack across her own heart” realization. The internal conflict (control vs. welcome) is resolved credibly if a touch swiftly. A slightly greater felt struggle before the surrender would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mender’s desire to repair both orchard and relationship is specific and embodied (copper nails, prism, ribbon), and her reactions—heart buckling at the mother‑face of leaves—feel earned. Contradictory impulses surface (craft‑competence vs. grief/guilt), though they’re more implied than dramatized in direct friction. Key micro‑choices (healing the graft, tying ribbon to memory, releasing vows) align with motive and carry cost. The daughter’s on‑page presence at the end adds relational pressure without diluting single‑POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive (forbidden knowledge) collides credibly with her fear of loss, yielding concrete, character‑particular beats (planting the seed; returning to the bathroom; accepting guardianship). Embodied emotion (“vomited stardust”; the cameo burning) prevents abstractness. Contradictory impulses are present and simultaneous, especially at the mirror and the final acceptance. The final renunciation—trading memory for stewardship—reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent, and the final renunciation (choosing to stay as the portal closes) registers as a real cost. Interiority is lyrical but somewhat generalized; her competency dominates, leaving limited on‑page contradiction or struggle. The empathy pivot (“researching gaps not in knowledge, but in empathy”) adds dimension but is stated rather than dramatized through resistance. Still, micro‑choices—deciphering plant language, drafting clauses, tearing pages into seeds—track with her resourceful identity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motive—recover sister/self through names—tightens into the stay/go renunciation with visible cost (the card crumbling, ship sinking). Contradictory impulses are live on the page (“Stay” vs “Go”), and micro‑choices (pulling threads, pressing the card to soil, exhaling the chord) reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority is specific and character‑particular without therapy‑speak. Minor abstraction at times, but emotion remains grounded in sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s competence, tactile attention, and archivist mindset are vivid, and her micro-choices (loosening indigo, tightening gold) reveal a values hierarchy. Motivation is clear and sustained: translating confusion into clarity. However, internal conflict is light; she encounters little doubt or friction, so the change reads more as fulfillment than costly transformation. The “warmly methodical” trait informs action but never forces a difficult trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, embodied interiority with a credible contradiction: she hoards hush yet longs for “quiet in the storm.” Micro‑choices (clenching the stone, then opening her hand; placing it in the rivulet) reveal values under pressure. The relationship with the energy being applies soft but real pressure. Slightly declarative insight (“not to conquer but to teach”) trims the rawness of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation (rekindling the beacon and validating coincidence) is clear and embodied in concrete micro‑choices (placing the prism, tracing star paths, whispering names). Contradictory impulses surface—faith in patterns vs. the shard’s threat to swallow her—but interpersonal crucible is absent, limiting complexity. Emotions are particular (“colors too bright to bear,” binding loss to repair) and actions align with belief. The endurance cost registers in the shard’s dissolution and her acceptance of keeper role.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s goal and fear are clear—curating memory without betraying the rest—and her tactics (shadow-mapping, then renouncing selection to “listen”) reveal a credible internal conflict. The discovery of the obelisk triggers a shift from control to witness with embodied cost (“antiseptic corridors,” “unmarked coffins”). Micro-choices under pressure (working before the next storm, tearing the page, pressing it to the obelisk) align with motive. Slight on-the-nose phrasing surfaces at the insight beats, but it doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she arrives to defy “the gravity of hopelessness”—and her choices (using the rag to unlock the mosaic, repurposing the cannon) align with that. Interiority is conveyed through a distinctive perceptual mode (chant as filter) rather than label‑speak. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little resistance and rarely wavers, which limits layered conflict. The change is credible but largely graceful, with soft cost (spending the rag, accepting a future call).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motives and contradictions are specific: the chronicler’s impulse toward data versus his hunger for “texture,” and his split loyalty between the grotto and Mara. Micro‑choices (touching the cicada, offering it to Mara, returning it to its niche, resolving to write differently) reveal values under pressure. Embodied emotion lands via tactile, sensory noticing (damp notebook, iodine scent) and the cost of facing the unmailed letter through shared vision. The relationship shifts credibly from avoidance to a charged poise of presence without tidy reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, embodied desire (escape claustrophobia; savor silences) drives choices: leaving the doll as anchor, later muting the alarm, and teaching her father. Contradictory impulses (yearning for vastness yet returning to bunker; collecting hush as survival tool) read as textured, not neat. The father–daughter dynamic sharpens motive in “Teach me,” shifting status credibly. The change is earned with visible costs (sacrifice of the doll, risk under the one-hour inversion).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive—to teach silence to comfort—drives concrete, compassionate choices (placing the vial, calibrating breath), and the child’s presence functions as a live pressure. Interiority is mostly conveyed through tactile action and attention, not summary, which keeps it specific. The piece favors serene competence over contradiction; a deeper internal snag or cost for Lira would amplify complexity. The child’s shift from mute sorrow to sigh and smile lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: a wisely adventurous archivist racing to find/complete the stairway before sunrise. Interiority appears in tactile ways (tracing pigments, feeding memories) and in the spoken “forbidden history,” but internal contradiction is modest. The staircase demanding truth produces one credible test of self, yet the felt personal cost of becoming “keeper” over anonymity is largely conceptual, not viscerally dramatized. Strong, but not yet piercing in its psychological ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is coherent and embodied: she seeks to “teach suffocating to breathe” while carrying the cost of severed ties. Interiority is specific (the burn, the ring’s chill/warmth) and contradictions are live (tenderness vs. deliberate burning). Micro-choices—placing the ring, breathing shadows, stepping past the threshold—reveal values under pressure. A slight tendency to abstract declarations (“not destruction but refinement”) softens the bite of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a guilty ex-recruiter tempted to “game the system” yet choosing renunciation under pressure. Concrete micro‑choices (descending, using the bolt, accepting “I volunteer to be the pressure,” exhaling the last sales pitch) reveal a hierarchy of values. Embodied images (“air tasted of iodine and regret,” tunnel’s “tenderness of a forge”) keep emotion particular. The final choice forecloses a lucrative, self‑serving path with a felt, character‑specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clean and compelling from the first line, and the revelation recasts her mission with credible pressure. Interiority is embodied (vibration in the crank, pressure on the sternum) and the on‑page fork—smash/burn vs keep turning—shows contradictory impulses. The final renunciation reads earned by the confession and her tactile bond to the handle. A minor softness: her rapid acceptance of being the heir skirts deeper resistance, but it doesn’t break the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Calen’s motive chain—regret over desertion, pull of the old oath, desire to restitch reality—translates into concrete micro‑choices (open the crate, whisper the allegiance, unsnap the clasp, cross the threshold). Embodied detail (“gauntleted fingers trembling,” scents and textures) grounds interiority. The contradiction of a “withdrawn knight” choosing renewed commitment is credible. Slight softness: minimal on‑page resistance or hesitation makes the transformation read smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is precise and embodied—the button’s weight, dust murals, and the “Return to Sender” envelope reveal a character who makes careful, value‑driven micro‑choices under pressure. Her contradictory impulses (yearning for answers vs. a disciplined archival patience) surface credibly. The forgiveness beat is earned by prior images and actions. No therapy‑speak or safety hedging dilutes her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clean and consistent—she’s an underestimated courier turned memory‑smuggler—and her micro‑choices (becoming “stillness,” letting the boy pass) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The line “mercy could be a louder alarm than cruelty” shows a hardened ethic with cost. Interiority stays particular to Lira’s praxis rather than generic angst. A touch more on her fear or doubt under peak pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (preventing the prophecy) meets a character‑particular contradiction: a musician choosing subtraction over performance. Interiority is sensory and embodied (reed damp with the grotto’s breath; code in his ribs). The renunciation is earned by the radio operator’s code and the etched spiral matching his pulse. The cost—carrying “folded silence” and refusing to play—reads credibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elian’s motive evolves cleanly from compulsive order to decoding and finally consenting to transformation; fear vs curiosity is dramatized (“Fear pricked him—… but curiosity was stronger”). Micro‑choices (building shrines, climbing, pressing moonstone into his own skin) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Embodied specifics (walnut‑stained fingers, “mossy delight”) ground interiority without summary labels. The final renunciation of self has visible cost and reads fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s motives and contradictions are clear: a fixer of time who chooses to “befriend uncertainty,” and he acts on that ethos (pocketing the rose, descending, fusing, retooling his craft). Interiority arrives through tactile perceptions (“rag that smelled of oil and regret”) rather than labels. The change is credible and costs him certainty, though the internal struggle could tighten into one sharper moment of doubt under pressure. Absence of on‑page relational friction limits depth, but the widow’s backward clock adds human stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation—redeeming her mother’s name by transforming guilt into ballast—is clear, specific, and enacted through tactile choices. Contradictory impulses (erase vs. honor the crack) are dramatized at the crucible and coin beats. The final renunciation/acceptance is earned by prior ritual steps and the past failure with Aquarius. A small caveat: one line edges toward telling (“Transformation…was a negotiation with limits”), but it’s supported by surrounding action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear desire (integrate laughter into healing) and steady agency: she descends, offers her palm, uncorks vials, and gives up the tooth. Interiority is embodied through sensory bias (vials chiming, mica like starlight) rather than labels. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is minimal—she remains composed, with little visible fear/temptation battle. The final micro‑choice to speak after a century feels earned and character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, embodied interiority drives micro‑choices under pressure, from reflexive bracing to the deliberate pivot at “seventeen” and the Fibonacci walk. Contradictory impulses (reflex brace vs. chosen grounding; withheld vs. confessed names) coexist credibly. The apology to the absent person adds cost and specificity. The closing renunciation (burying the strap) feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear motive—she’s a translator of overlooked histories—and concrete micro‑choices under pressure: stepping through the painting, refusing to follow the children, paying with a memory. The costed renunciation (not following, surrendering the grandmother’s trembling‑hands memory) reads earned. Interiority is sensorially grounded rather than labeled. A touch more internal contradiction on the parapet would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation (to learn what ceilings hide and relieve the ghost‑borne pressure) is clear and enacted through concrete choices, with embodied interiority (“warm, pulsing” ceiling; dust as memory). The reluctant ghost‑seer contradiction is active—skepticism “cracks” and she chooses to engage. The visible cost (leaving the heirloom mainspring and, implicitly, her job’s old orbit) grounds the change. Minor note: her competence faces little resistance, keeping struggle on the gentler side.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—bored by perfection, she seeks rupture and “to compress eternity into a moment.” Agency is consistent across micro‑choices (uncorking specific bottles, setting the press to a nascent word, then reversing it). Interiority is lyric but mostly externalized; little contradictory impulse or hesitation appears under pressure. The final renunciation—drinking “Forever”—lands as an earned stance but not a deeply conflicted one.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: failed revolutionary, elegist, thief vs. “translator.” Concrete micro-choices (covering mirrors, hosting midnight readings, surrendering the vase) reveal values under pressure. The Solenne exchange sharpens moral stakes without flattening Mara’s guilt. A slight softness remains in how easily her new stance takes hold socially.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Emil’s drive is clear and particular, embodied through tool‑use and song; his doubt flicker and subsequent vow create credible internal tension. Micro‑choices (testing the chip, choosing to sing, offering his hand to Midnight) reveal values under pressure. The compassionate pivot from conquest to repair of Midnight is earned and character‑specific. Cost is felt as he accepts balance over pure victory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motives are vivid and particular (petrichor as inheritance; “endings are only doors installed backward”), and her micro‑choices (descending, reading the compass, refusing the breach) align with them. Contradictory impulses are present at the hinge—yearning to cross versus choosing renunciation—and the refusal carries a felt cost. Interiority stays embodied through sensory bias rather than abstraction. The only slight limit is that her competence faces little resistance before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara reads as a specific, embodied maker whose choices drive the piece (stepping under the arch, accepting the slide, tending the arrivals). Interiority is present without therapy-speak, though conflict is mostly quiet and mythic rather than sharply contradictory. The relationship with Older Mara briefly sharpens pressure and hands off responsibility credibly. The final acceptance of stewardship shows an earned endurance with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s need “to paint the answer before winter sealed the valley” drives tangible choices (candle, pigment, refusal to light the candle) and culminates in a credible renunciation (from understanding to witnessing). Interiority is embodied through tactile craft and observation rather than abstract labels. Contradictory impulses—control vs. surrender—surface in the choice not to light the candle. The cost is subtle but felt: she gives up the quest’s solving impulse for a stance of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to decode the diary and name the disappeared—is clear and consistent, and her actions (descending to the deck, arranging debris, speaking to Nimue) track tightly with that aim. Interiority is embodied (“fear braid with her own resolve”), and the retrocognitive bleed adds tension without over-explaining. Contradictory impulses (tremor vs. steadiness) surface credibly at peak beats. The closing acceptance of responsibility reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (rejecting false comfort, choosing conceived revival) drives concrete micro‑choices: speaking the blueprint, setting down the bottle, and leaving. Interiority is sensorial and particular (star‑anise, rotting pilings), though internal contradiction is mild and rarely contested on the page. The renunciation carries cost but faces little active resistance, slightly softening pressure. Still, actions align tightly with traits and yield an earned stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elowen’s core contradiction—archivist of vows vs. participant in a living oath—drives credible micro‑choices from listening/translating to the costly pivot of speaking a new oath. Embodied perception (ear‑trumpet to bark, wax like dried blood) grounds emotion. The renunciation of detachment is earned and forecloses a path. Minor hedge: her change arrives smoothly, with little internal resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motivation (to reopen and understand “borrowed time”) meets a credible counter-impulse (preservation), culminating in a renunciation when the membrane “threaten[s] to tear.” Embodied perception and ritualized action reveal a meticulous temperament without exposition. Micro‑choices (seed placement, breath control, withdrawal) show values under pressure. The cost—foregoing full entry now to protect the inheritance—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (prefers listening over noise) drives every micro-choice from timing the pull to easing the hum down. Interiority is grounded in concrete perception (barometer, anemometer) rather than labels, and the correction “I listened” crystallizes his ethos. Internal contradiction is subtle (technician vs quasi‑sacral role) but present and resolved into earned responsibility. The cost—accepting stewardship and a year’s vigilance—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The janitor’s motive—answering an ache of absence and honoring his order—drives concrete, evolving choices (aligning the glass, tracing meteors, opening his chest). The internal turn from “brooms are useless” to embracing darkness reads as a true shift rather than a pose. Contradictory impulses are present but relatively gentle; struggle is more contemplative than contested. Still, his agency is clear and the renunciation carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear and consistent: he seeks to read and preserve unspoken promises, and he chooses to stay, foreclosing return to the city. Interiority is implied more than dramatized; the recluse remains archetypal and emotionally cool. Still, his micro‑choices (opening the box, reading, adding his own strip) align with the pressure. A richer contradiction under stress would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motivation and embodied interiority (textures felt by skin) drive tactile micro-choices. The protagonist’s agency—paper airplane, stair ascent, fusing shard and gear, waiting—reveals values under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle (yearning vs. surrender to non-counting time) but present. Emotional cost lands in the “exquisite ache” and the quiet renunciation of numbered time.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied (salt and storm on her cheek; footprints dissolving), with micro-choices that reveal values under pressure (writing “unfinished,” pausing to right a crab). The contradictory impulse—former triumph-seeking child versus adult tending surrender—threads the piece and resolves credibly into acceptance. Motivation remains specific and consistent: to tend incompletion without numbing it. The earned renunciation at the end forecloses a path (pursuit of finished beauty) with a felt cost (embracing erasure).

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motive—renewing a living treaty before she dies—is clear and embodied in specific micro‑choices (one branch, one wire, one page). The acceptance of mortality versus dwindling strength gives credible endurance with cost. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than contested, tilting toward serenity over struggle. The final renunciation (finishing the work and dying) is earned by prior labor and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive and contradiction are vivid: a “luminous skeptic” who rejects a sanitized pilgrimage for the “equation beneath the myth.” Her interior conflict materializes on the page (“a miracle dismantling her instead”), and micro‑choices (following footprints, kneeling at the orchid, placing the amber) align with that. The emotional cost—surrendering a defining skepticism—reads credibly in tears and embodied awe. Limited only by the brevity of resistance at the peak, which leans lyric over dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—he sows to heal a poisoned battlefield and rebind land/sea, using his mother’s seeds and ash. Interiority is conveyed through actions and languages rather than exposition, which fits the lyric frame. Internal contradiction is light (grief versus hope) but present in the “hearhe-coach” driver who now plants instead of ferrying soldiers. The final choice—using the last pod at the jetty—reads earned and carries a visible cost (the last chance).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is coherently rooted in the bloodhound’s sensory life and past function, and his micro-choices—following the “impossible” scent, choosing to listen rather than bark—track cleanly to a felt reorientation. Interiority is vivid and embodied through smell-sound synesthesia. The relationship with Grayson adds gentle pressure without stealing POV. Slightly less on-page contradiction under peak stress keeps it shy of a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, consistent motive (compassionate navigator) meets a live contradiction at the threshold: the urge to cross vs. the choice to translate and tether via sketches. Interiority is specific and embodied (frost, chime, trembling brass) rather than abstract. The renunciation of crossing is credible and value-driven, foreclosing a path. Slight softness: the rescue feels relatively frictionless once the tactic is found, reducing felt self-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motive (“steal back wonder”) is clear, and his hesitation upon finding his birth-name credibly reveals an internal fault line that he must release. Lira’s status shifts from adversarial to invitational, applying pressure through the rules of the game. The relationship dynamic is legible and catalyzes his choices. Interiority is evocative but a touch spare; we glimpse fear and honor rather than inhabit them.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—to shed rehearsed roles and assume the costlier duty of witness—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (lifting the board, spelling words, arranging a circle, recounting gestures). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“smoke still clung to her hair like a reluctant crown”). The internal contradiction—tenderness paired with “benevolent ruthlessness”—is dramatized rather than declared. The final renunciation (STAY) credibly forecloses flight and nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies—from fleeing pain to embracing the cost of remembrance to rebuild “home.” Interiority is embodied (mercury tears, iron‑tasting air) and the actions align (placing the stone, speaking the word). Contradictory impulses—urge to forget vs. duty to speak—coexist credibly. Minor safety: she succeeds without much on‑page struggle once the tree is found.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen’s motive is concrete and sustained—he enters to “winnow the guilt” and his choices track that aim through decoding, advancing, and finally renouncing control. Interiority is specific to him (chess lexicon, “productive fidget”) and embodied. The key reversal—sitting, accepting the toppled king, and speaking the prodigy’s name—feels earned. A slightly tidier emotional glide than ideal reduces the sense of contradictory impulses under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysandra’s drive is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (climbing, reading, persisting as guards rush) align with her motive. Interiority is present but largely declarative; she rarely shows contradictory impulses under pressure. The emotional cost is implied (risk of exile, loss of what remains) but not keenly felt on the page. Strong, but short on lived conflict and flaw complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, embodied motive (keep the workshop afloat by “quilting” meaning) meets credible fear and doubt; the ritual submersions and gold‑vein mending reveal character under pressure. Contradictory impulses (uncertainty vs. compulsion to narrate) play in scene, especially when the mainspring cracks and the pace quickens. The acceptance of keeper‑duty after the statue dissolves reads as an earned cost. Slight limit: interior conflict could cut a shade deeper at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular: to return the painted shell and test what “temporary eternity” demands. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts (tucking the shell, standing still as the lagoon rises) rather than label-speak. The contradictory impulse—intimate pull vs. aloof stance—surfaces in the ritual of release and the refusal to look back. The renunciation (leaving the blank shell) feels earned with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: she wants to prove the power of whispers yet carries a need to scream, embodied in tactile actions (hand on stone, palms to lens). The internal conflict sharpens under pressure as the hum “demands more,” culminating in a costly release. Interiority is concrete through scent‑memory and occupational detail. Slight idealization remains—her flaw is largely repression—but the cost (collapse, dissolution of the cork) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Grief-driven motive is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (placing glass where heat peaks, bleeding onto the bronze) embody that desire under pressure. Internal contradiction (resistance vs. compliance) is present but light, largely resolved early. The sibling relationship functions as crucible through the echo beside her and the final exchange of the bronze. A meaningful change lands at the end with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motive is crisp (forage, map, survive) and under pressure her skepticism rubs against wonder and fear (“I laughed… and the sound cracked a branch”). Micro-choices—pocketing the eye, reading cures, planting it, staying on—reveal a hierarchy of values. The involuntary truth compulsion creates credible social and tactical constraints. The cost is quiet but real: she accepts stewardship and exposure as the trees “sense fear,” foreclosing flight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motivation (decode the stranger’s gesture and shoulder what she left) anchors every micro‑choice, and emotions are embodied through tactile action (counting gaps, scent‑triggered memory). The internal turn—from uncertainty to chosen burden—reads earned, with a felt price in accepting grief. A touch more on his resistance or competing impulse would deepen the crucible. Still, the keeper’s specificity and method reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motive—keeping a promise to Lila—coherently drives every beat and culminates in an earned renunciation. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (maps, numbers, ants) with credible contradiction at the mirror. His refusal forecloses a life‑reset with a felt cost. Minor note: the “empirically intuitive” label is more shown than tested by failure, but does not undercut the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and urgent (astronomers’ warning; climb to unravel dreams), and the internal contradiction (disenchanted ruler vs. longing for reconciliation) is embodied in concrete beats. The child‑self encounter externalizes conflict without feeling like a gimmick. The choice to take the flame into her chest reads as a credible renunciation of earlier ambition. Slight neatness in the emotional landing trims the edge of mess that might deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives are clear and embodied through concrete choices: aligning the shell, cracking it, crushing the last pocket‑sun, and stepping into the helix. The relationship with Cael tightens those choices and reconfigures status in the final hand‑off. The internal conflict is somewhat low‑friction, with near‑immediate insight after Cael’s line, but it feels earned by their shared history and tools on the page. Emotional texture is vivid and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and contradictory—she both envies and scorns her younger and older selves, and the micro‑choices (bleeding onto the bark, stepping off the planks, shouting for the ending, then letting the scroll burn) feel motivated by her need to control narrative versus accept chaos. The mirror exchange (“You wasted the wings” / “You never learned to fall”) crystallizes her flaw set. The renunciation at the end forecloses a path (hoarding, control) with felt cost (surrendering the scroll and its “hoarded” words). A slight explicitness in the later “chaos had always been the truest narrative” trims subtlety a touch.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive (finding a new sensory map after anosmia) is clear and actionable, with tactile micro‑choices (feeling for the fracture, choosing synthetic rose, seating the screw) revealing character under pressure. Her internal contradiction—resigned loss versus stubborn hope—surfaces in the rose‑oil attempt. Embodiment is acute and character‑specific (hearing cedar “with the hollow beneath her ribs”). Milo applies gentle, relevant pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, embodied motivation—transform scars into stories before the rock falls—drives micro-choices under pressure (holding breath, tapping the quill, choosing to “shed”). Contradictory impulses—exhale vs. endurance, shame vs. agency—operate simultaneously. The final alteration (soft skin, book made of former scars) feels earned by on‑page effort. Slight neatness to the resolution keeps it shy of a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Her motive—deliver an apology before the orchard falls—is vivid and steady, with embodied guilt (ether-roughened voice, the bottle’s “evaporated longing”). The micro-choices (using the pipe for induced currents, choosing metaphor over plain speech) reveal a practiced, idiosyncratic professional under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt; she’s resolute more than torn, which slightly limits complexity. Still, the final renunciation—leaving the emptied bottle and accepting an “imperfect miracle”—registers as a credible, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The witness’s motives are clear and sustained, and her choices (aligning “unify,” walking outward, merging with the mirror, swallowing the dot) track with the pressure. Interiority is vivid but archetypal; we feel texture more than a distinctive personal psychology. Moments like “fragmenting into narrative possibilities” hint at contradiction, but the human-specific cost is glancing rather than deeply individualized. The renunciation of “end of history witness” status reads as earned, if emotionally generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, embodied interiority (“razor edges pressing a faint lattice”) and a credible contradiction between duty (charter calibration) and belief (time’s ache). His micro‑choices—retarding the escapement “not to correct but to commemorate,” accepting the officers’ wrath—foreclose a path with felt cost. The progression from counting to renunciation feels earned. Minor hedge: the revelation edges toward aphorism but is anchored by tactile stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, coherent interiority with a credible push–pull between vigilance and surrender (“a promise she had not yet decided to keep”). Micro‑choices (testing the sheet, stepping through, offering the pointer) track motivation and culminate in an earned reconfiguration. The stranger relationship acts as a catalytic crucible without stealing agency. A few aphoristic lines skim toward neatness but don’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s grief-, math-, and gambler-schooled interiority is concrete and specific, and her micro-choices (photographing, methodically “traversing,” and obeying the roof directive despite skepticism) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The father-daughter contradiction—rationalist versus talismanic impulse—animates each beat. The ending forecloses a path (“without betting her heart”) with felt cost. A slight safety in how smoothly she moves from doubt to assent keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motives—cultivated estrangement shifting to a willingness to pay a personal cost—are clear and escalate credibly toward her final sacrifice. Interiority is specific (the ledger with “Endings/Begin,” her recognition of Lila’s fear mirroring the tunnel’s no-exit schematic). Her decisive act (dialing the booth’s number) forecloses a path with cost. Slightly more embodied hesitation before self‑dissolution could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline—she’s there to record the covenant—and pressure exposes contradiction: the pull to witness versus self-preservation (“She did not step back”). Interiority is embodied and particular (temperature drop, pollen count, grief sharpening perception). The choice to stay is earned by earlier methodical attention and maternal legacy. Cost registers as identity-thinning and accepting the burden to carry “the weight of small moments.”

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s need to balance years of outward service against private loneliness is vivid, embodied by the ledger, the moon rock against her heart, and the brittle jokes. Her contradictory impulses—skepticism of “gossip” vs. choosing to trust it—play out in scene and culminate in relinquishing the stone. The cost is felt (“like a pulled tooth”), and the renunciation is earned. A shade more friction or risk in the act itself could deepen her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Desire and tactic are clear from line one, and micro‑choices (barefoot following, entering the stillpoint, naming grief) track to an embodied interiority. The blindness and tactile lexicon individualize perception without sentimentality. The final renunciation (“mapmaker no longer”) feels earned by prior beats. Slight neatness in the epiphany trims the peak: the realization borders on tidy rather than paradoxically knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (“tasted iron… flavor of revised regret”), with contradictory impulses (mercy vs. justice, saving vs. witnessing) in motion. Her micro-choices—changing “flourished” to “endured,” unbending the lie—align with motive and reveal her ethics under pressure. The renunciation at the end (“witness,” not “savior”) forecloses a path with cost (the nib snaps; she accepts limits). The late exchange with the old woman adds a relational facet without diluting the single‑POV drive.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: a deaf former composer aims to “translate silence into music,” and every micro‑choice (setting the camera, signing to the tide, stepping into the water, refusing to look back) flows from that drive. Interiority is textured through tactile, idiosyncratic perception rather than labels. The joyful sorrow contradiction is dramatized, not asserted, especially in the underwater conducting beat. Minor note: the “quietly charismatic” trait influences tone more than choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motive (atonement for the fire and a kept promise) drives concrete micro‑choices—distilling ink from tears, painting syllabic phoenixes, pressing the key, stepping into the sarcophagus. Embodied emotion (“volcanic tenderness,” “trembling fingers”) feels specific to this character. Internal contradiction (arsonist/archivist; destroyer/preserver) is vivid but faces little on‑page resistance. The final renunciation—becoming the archive’s heartbeat—reads earned, though the struggle could tighten with one sharper test.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s internal push-pull—honoring “every borrowed heartbeat” while reclaiming “her own name”—is textured and embodied through drumming and taste-scent memory flashes. Motivations are consistent and intensify toward the lagoon’s offer (“drink, and weave them all into one breathing song”). The quiet-rebellion trait translates into concrete micro-choices (gentling the beat, dipping her finger, tucking rebellion behind a smile). The final endurance choice reads as earned stasis with felt cost (the ward and “next dose” remain).

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (“prove that whispers travel farther than shouts”) drives each choice, from ignoring radios to selecting the oldest map. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (harness, coin heat), though internal contradiction is minimal—Mara is largely assured rather than torn. Micro‑choices (map selection, gait adjustments) reveal values without therapy‑speak. The closing endurance (measuring in softness) feels earned but exact cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guardian’s vow-bound silence and ritualized labor make his motivation legible and consistent, with embodied choices (shutters, mirror, weaving) revealing character. Interiority is conveyed through action rather than thought, fitting the piece’s lyric mode. The lack of explicit internal contradiction undercuts peak complexity a touch, but endurance-as-stance feels earned. The moment he lifts the pearl on the mirror most strongly fuses motive and action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—“humble rebellion” seeded through chess—drives concrete choices (following the whispers, devising the synchronized displays, teaching the puzzle). Interiority is specific (library whispers, magnetic tug) but internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little resistance or doubt. Micro‑choices (leaving the library at night, trusting shopkeepers) are present but low‑friction. The ending’s vow reads earned yet lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s contradiction—grace as a survival mask vs. unbladed fierceness—drives credible choices, culminating in the costly decision to stay. Embodied interiority (barnacled beam, kelp snaring, scrimshaw warming) avoids stock feeling labels. The dock workers’ quiet envy and the web‑handed woman’s offer sharpen her value hierarchy. Minor safety: her leap to trust the island reads swift but still motivated by the chorus‑call and harbor stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Two sharply drawn figures under pressure make credible, revealing micro‑choices: the performer’s ritualized whittling/narration and the farmer’s hesitant then accepting touch. Motivation is explicit (“to cultivate lightness in grief”) and enacted through the hollowed heart and petal. Internal contradiction glimmers (blank face vs. softening; refusal to touch vs. reaching). “Morally ambiguous” is gestured rather than dramatized, slightly softening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (“the old ache…the need to stride through boundaries”) drives concrete actions—paraphrasing the ban, pressing the notebook, stepping through the membrane. Interiority is sensuous and embodied (iron/snow taste, tremor in the wrist). Internal contradiction is present but soft—fear dissolves rather than contends, so cost reads more conceptual than visceral. The arc from tremor to song is earned but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—seeking beauty despite colorblindness—drives concrete choices (accepting the trade; arranging plants) under real cost. Interiority feels embodied and particular (“tasted of iron and cherries”), with simultaneous contradiction (desire vs. fear of losing “awakening”). Her “innocently cunning” mask under pressure reveals value hierarchy. The final acceptance of the dome reads as earned stasis with cost acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear from the outset and enacted through concrete, gentle micro-choices (opening jars, refracting sound, tapping the fork, choosing to stay). Interiority is specific (“silence inside her feels heavier than any cathedral bell”) and consistent with the “powerfully gentle” trait. The final renunciation—remaining as keeper—feels earned by prior acts. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (gentleness under heavy silence); a slightly sharper felt cost would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (to forget, then to tend) evolves through concrete micro-choices: polishing lenses, leaving cranes, pricking the sky, planting the locket. The push–pull between erasure and remembrance reads on the page without therapy‑speak. The visible cost—relinquishing the mourning locket’s function—feels earned by prior actions. A slightly aphoristic self‑naming at the end (“You have become…”) edges toward neatness but remains character‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motives are clear and particular—an ex‑profit seer mapping value’s migration—enacted through tactile micro‑choices (spiral of cards, tape as lens, leaving a compass). Contradictory impulses surface (nostalgia vs. forward mapping) without melodrama, e.g., “wrapping [the tape] around her wrist like a tourniquet against nostalgia.” The cost is mostly conceptual but legible: she lets go of profit, accepts that any new map will “also crash,” and leaves her tools behind for others. Slight limitation: interior conflict remains quiet, with minimal direct pressure testing her resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and propulsive—she seeks forbidden truth and “purification” redefined as clarifying pain. Interiority is embodied (iron/salt air, teeth-vibration, the crushed firefly) and her realization (“not addition but subtraction”) credibly shifts tactics. Contradictory impulses surface in the urge to warn her younger self vs. accepting memory’s limits. The cost is felt in the weeping and destruction of the archive she came to save.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lira’s contradiction—ordered to “catalogue, never to intervene” yet choosing to act—drives credible, escalating micro‑choices. Her embodied bond with the stone (“pulse like a second heart”) grounds emotion. The sacrifice is concrete: she violates role to preserve hope, accepting future burden. Interiority stays character‑specific, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motives (repair, protect, and expose) are coherent and intensify under pressure; contradictory impulses—anger versus gentleness, need to be “good” versus truth-telling—operate simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (saline bath, pulling matrices, labeling “Mirage,” contacting an investigator) reveal a value hierarchy. The renunciation—letting go of being “purely good” for vigilant compassion—feels earned with a visible emotional cost. Slight tidiness in her resolution prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive—hard-won closure—drives each micro‑choice from following “tunnel” to reopening the fresh scar, with embodied cost (blood, dizziness, loss of telepathy). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular (coffee rings as narrative, plants’ whispers), not generic. The contradiction—seeking closure by literally opening a wound—enriches the final act. The renunciation at the end (giving up the green voices) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s desire “to find where unused love is stored” is clear, embodied in tactile choices (pressing the film, threading the projector, singing) and complicated by regret over Lin. Her contradictory impulses—archival duty vs. private errand; pursuit vs. renunciation—coexist on the page. The renunciation at the end (“She would not follow, but she would no longer stand still.”) feels earned and carries a felt cost. Slight hedge: interior conflict is more lyric than pressure-tested by an opposing force in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and specific: she seeks to unbar creativity hardened by fear and failure. Interiority is embodied and particular (frost‑silvered lashes, copper‑and‑snow syllables), with credible contradictory impulses—yearning versus fear—active in scene. Micro‑choices under pressure (kneeling, laying the sextant down, aligning paths, aiming it at her reflection, speaking a vow) earn the change. The cost—agreeing to carry the unwritten and surrender fear—reads as an ongoing burden rather than a clean cure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (shift from escorting to “cultivating sparks”) drives concrete choices, especially pressing the spark into the clock against the archive’s interest. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“feels in his teeth,” “fractured lullaby”). The renunciation of his original duty carries cost (unmaking the archive; burning returns). Slightly limited contradiction on the page—he pivots decisively but the tension between duty and cultivation could surface earlier under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, consistent desire (“rediscover the wild frontier of her mind”) drives concrete choices (choosing DELUSION, inserting the gear). Interiority is vivid and embodied, with a credible surrender of identity as cost. The internal contradiction—craving wilderness vs. the city’s certainty—animates the path choice and the renunciation of the map. A slightly softer depiction of simultaneous push–pull under peak stress keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation and arc are clear: the boy seeks courage and the guides midwife that transformation. Interiority is mostly externalized through ritual and image rather than deep internal monologue, but the micro‑choice to speak “Stay” lands as character‑specific. The guides’ embodied knowledge (“salt in their joints”) differentiates them without stereotyping. Some contradiction (fear vs. draw toward the path) is present but lightly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (numb fingertips, thaw‑needles), and the duty/escape contradiction sharpens credibly into the final choice. Micro‑choices (not investigating the scream; turning the bolt) reveal values under pressure. The erased name/keys motif anchors motive without exposition. Minor softness: the realization is accelerated by the bolt’s explicit whisper rather than wholly inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thimble’s motive—restore truth and unmask the pretender—is clear and consistent, and his key choice (to deploy the rune) aligns with it. Interiority is specific (amber eyes, calloused feet; long study of cryptic margins), though largely composed and competent with little in-scene contradiction or doubt. Emotional cost is present but muted (a “small, sad” smile; innocence lost). Strong, but a touch frictionless in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s drive is clear and embodied: a former coral-bleaching witness turned gauge keeper compelled to decode vanishing routes. Her agency leads each turn (tapping, assembling, descending), with a credible moment of hesitation before the spiral. Interiority is concrete and sensory (ear to titanium, bioluminescence), though internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized. The endurance at the end (“vigil,” logging nothing) reads as a meaningful, earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, embodied interiority (“awkwardly confident,” barefoot tactility) and micro-choices (climb, place the glasses, forego flying) reveal values under pressure. The trait-level contradiction—hesitant poise versus bold action—feels particular and consistent. The final renunciation (not a pilot, will carry the note) reads earned, though the personal cost is more conceptual than visceral. A secondary pressure from other people is absent by design, keeping the crucible purely intrapersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s motives are vivid and coherent—an ex‑insurgent whose private heresy (the hidden bullet) aligns with a present urge to evolve tradition. Interiority is sensory and character‑particular (plants “gossip,” moss “spells”), with micro‑choices under pressure: prying the slab despite heat; presenting the embryo to skeptics. The internal conflict—reverence for tradition vs. action toward change—stays live through the communal scene. Cost is felt in risking communal censure and in bodily pain, though resistance from elders resolves a touch quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, embodied interiority (“somatic markers,” metallic taste, lungs freezing) grounds a credible need for stillness and guides micro‑choices (breathing, pressing the photo to bark, writing “Still possible,” leaving the photo). Contradictory impulses (witnessing grief vs. seeking calm) coexist rather than alternate, culminating in an earned renunciation that carries cost. One minor risk is the clinical term “somatic markers,” but it’s integrated through sensory detail rather than therapy‑speak summary.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive shifts credibly from commissioned portrait to salvaging identity through art, with embodied choices (weaving paint threads, stepping through a drawn door, sketching “light inside” the skull). Her contradictory impulses—fear of obliteration vs. compulsion to descend—coexist in scene. Emotion is concrete (brine at the knees, dust like plankton) rather than labeled. The final renunciation of a tidy self (“a face neither hers nor his but both”) reads earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.6)
    Alba’s motive and temperament (serene anger, tracker competence) are clear, and her decisive acts—syncing the drone, stepping through, choosing rescue over escape—align with those traits. Internal contradiction is limited; serenity vs. anger coexists but rarely produces in‑scene friction or a costly dilemma. The late appearance of the chronographer gives a thin relational crucible, with little pressure between them. The final choice lacks a visible price paid on the page, dampening the arc’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motives are clear and layered—duty, love, and fear braid into her micro‑choices (duping locks, overriding warnings, choosing to broadcast). Interiority is embodied through cold‑strained breath and violet fingertips rather than labels. The “bravely conflicted” stance persists in scene, culminating in a costly commitment. Only slight hedge: the personal cost remains mostly implied rather than directly exacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lila’s motive—preserving “continuity through chaos”—is clear and enacted through micro‑choices (burying the canvas, offering a rose). The pacifist daughter of a bounty hunter premise creates credible internal tension without melodrama. Her perceptions and actions align, and the refusal to arm herself at the hatch is an earned renunciation with cost. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but not severely tested beyond the single nonviolent offering.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s motive is clear and particular—“to catch the echo of a goddess”—and her tactics (zigzagging, voicing silence, driving the spike) reveal a cool strategist who chooses to relinquish that coolness. The embodied cost lands when she lets her pulse race and accepts the burn. The internal contradiction (discipline vs surrender) is present but resolves quickly and mostly without friction. A touch more resistance or misstep before yielding would deepen the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Octavia’s motivation—ending her father’s “orbit of regret”—is clear and intensifies under the journalist’s pressure and the literal countdown. Interiority is character‑specific (pens, meteorite iron, observatory bells) and her micro‑choices (aiming, calculating drag, choosing proof over force) reveal values. The emotional cost lands in embodied detail (tasting “meteorite justice,” moist eyes, the tossed nib). Slight softness: her success meets limited resistance, so internal contradiction could be sharper at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Motivation is crystal clear: hush the cry of old guilt. Her choices under pressure—slotting the amber, accepting the firmware’s tether, tattooing her own throat—are specific and costly. Contradictory impulses (erasure vs. containment) operate simultaneously and resolve in an earned renunciation. The final labeling of the amber with the would-be birthday seals the change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (to discover meaning) and a credible, embodied arc from grasping to permissive letting‑go. The tactile choices—drawing, widening the ring, palming the tile, leaving the grotto—track with her trait of reading social currents. The cost is legible when memories dissolve and silhouettes thank her for release. A slightly idealized competence (little real struggle) keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Azim’s “gentle radical” ethos and Leylah’s grief-forged softness are embodied through tactile choices (pressing the red tessera, continuing the rebuild). The motivation to choose empathy over rage is dramatized rather than told, though true inner contradiction is more implied than stressed. The dialogue carries subtext and pressure (“Empathy burns more than rage...”), and their partnership under pressure alters the plaza’s state. Slightly limited by the protagonist’s relatively untroubled certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Her motive (an encore, salvaging the collapsing timeline) is clear and sustained, and her actions—breathing life into the coin, pressing it into the tree, choosing to dance—align under pressure. The contradiction between craving applause and accepting dissolution is dramatized rather than stated. Interiority is embodied through synesthetic sensations rather than labels. The final renunciation (dissolving into motes) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” contradiction is vivid and enacted: she signs waivers, checks locks, then dissolves the pill and steps through. Embodied markers (behind-the-knees warmth; rib‑laughter) ground emotion and fuel micro‑choices (painting seams, circling with the brush). The encounter with the child‑self tightens the internal conflict into a choice to continue beyond safety. The cost is soft but legible: she accepts ongoing vulnerability as compass.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific from the first line—Lira returns to become “the voice of the unknown”—and her shift from speaking for to letting-through is credibly earned. Interiority is embodied via tools and sensations (color pulses, smells at the fork) rather than abstract labels. The decisive choice—pressing the fossil to the sleeper’s forehead and surrendering authorship—reveals values with felt cost (recorder silent, map no longer hers). Minor note: internal contradiction is more formal than messy, but the renunciation still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (fulfill the dying keeper’s charge before dawn), and her agency is steady and purposeful in selecting, arranging, uncorking, and finally sacrificing the seed‑pearl. Interiority arrives via tactile, profession‑filtered noticing (amber‑stained fingers, the hourglass) rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, which slightly limits dynamic tension. The small but felt cost (giving up the wedding‑gown pearl) credibly earns the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motives are clean and embodied: he withholds the pill, follows codes, burns the violet, climbs, and offers the apology. “Prudently daring” shows in tactile micro‑choices (testing snow impressions, careful descent). The relationship crucible pays off with a credible renunciation of defensive secrecy. Minor risk of epigrammatic reflection, but it’s anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, embodied interiority and credible contradictions: he could turn back but chooses to pay with memory. Micro-choices (nodding without coin, rowing harder under the ticking clock, offering the smile) align with grief and duty. Emotions are textured through tactile perception (fog through ribs) not labels. The costed endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kiran’s motive—understanding why some places resist change—drives concrete, moment‑by‑moment choices (blooming vs. char). Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual (palms open to the thrum, tracing sun patterns), not labels. The internal conflict is present but remains abstracted from a personal flaw or history, limiting depth. Still, his final stance (choosing the blooming at cost to the char) reads earned and character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motive—tending life and “reflect[ing] light into dark corners”—is enacted through precise micro‑choices with the gauge tooth and the hummed cadence. The “protected vulnerability” is embodied (match‑flame image) and tensions her pragmatism credibly. Stakes remain intimate but clear: revive a failing heirloom rose and carry forward a legacy. Minor softness: little external counter‑pressure beyond winter; the struggle is almost entirely internal/ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and intensifies: she alone holds the whales’ songs and must reprice isolation into independence. Interiority is embodied and specific (“knees buckled,” “brittle,” the taste of copper/rain) with a credible micro‑turn at “alone” → “all one.” The two-futures reflection concretizes contradictory impulses and culminates in a choice with cost. Slightly aphoristic phrasing (“isolation was not a prison but a seed”) trims a hair of grit from the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.7)
    Arin’s goal (to return the secrets and seek the connecting thread) is clear and drives her key choice to give up the twig; Elian adds immediate pressure. Interiority is particular and image‑led, though the conflict remains gentle with limited on‑page hesitation or contradiction. The cost—relinquishing the burden and identity of kept vows—is legible and earned. Dialogue reveals status and need without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyra’s motives are clear and active: she chooses to interfere, then adapts under pressure with the phase‑shift “mirror.” Interiority is embodied (“burnt sugar and regret,” sweaty palms) and the mentor’s credo sharpens her values without over‑explaining. The “numbers arriving with crystalline certainty” slightly shortcuts struggle, softening cost. Still, micro‑choices (fader adjustments, delay tweak) credibly reveal hierarchy of values: vigilance over fear.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s prudence versus claustrophobia is embodied in concrete tactics (counting steps, mapping exits) while corridors literally close, forcing micro‑choices under pressure. Her decision to touch the organ and later fuse the compass halves is motivated by memory and goal, not convenience. The farewell to her mother’s ghost registers as a felt cost. The interiority remains particular and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s constraints (prosopagnosia, methodical counting, painting negative space) drive concrete micro-choices and culminate in a credible renunciation: he lets the woman go and gives the charged canvas to the police. Interiority is embodied (numbered strokes, tears, tactile mist) rather than labeled. The motive—to pierce a seven‑year silence and unify absences—intensifies under pressure when the woman arrives. Slight limit: internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s motive—honoring Morag’s erased bravery—drives concrete choices, and her “nervously confident” temperament is dramatized in tactile actions (aligning the nail, speaking stanzas, pressing the mirror). The exchange question creates genuine internal friction between rescue fantasy and substitution cost. Embodied details (salt‑sweating walls, warm copper) keep emotions specific. Minor hedge: her acceptance cost is a touch conceptual versus fully felt in body at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive emerges through embodied perception and musical choice, but contradictory impulses are underplayed; she rarely hesitates before stepping into the lattice. Micro‑choices (tucking the flake under the chin rest, translating flutters while playing) reveal values. The final cost—accepting the fragment as the hitchhiker fades—lands credibly. A touch more friction around the decision to enter would deepen interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo’s motive—to mark and reframe the loop of return—reads specific and consistent, with embodied ritual (folding, tucking, burning) revealing him under pressure. His relation to Mara shows quiet status play (she arrives to dissuade; he redirects into a rite). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt; the piece leans endurance/renunciation over a torqued internal battle. The father legacy is integrated but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (decode the inscriptions) is clear and drives concrete choices—aligning the telegram, summoning Corin, speaking names. Interiority is specific (fear of being emptied by others’ dreams) and the costed renunciation at the end reads earned. Corin’s grief provides a live relational crucible that alters tactics (he must witness for her gift to work). Minor neatness—their progress faces little resistance—keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is clear (confront the lie and recover the conjurer) and escalates credibly as she chooses to plant the seed and then to bleed into the bloom. Interiority is specific and embodied—thorns, frost‑numbed fingers, iron‑and‑apple scent—avoiding label‑only emotion. Her contradiction (finder of lost things who refuses her own reflection) is dramatized and resolved at cost. The final renunciation of “armor of silence” reads earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyra’s motive (answering the glade’s call and repairing a broken covenant) is clear, and the hesitation before sacrificing memories shows credible internal conflict. “Purposefully curious” manifests in her pause to weigh which dreams to lose. The cost is concrete: personal memories surrendered to reforge the covenant. Slight safety in how smoothly she embraces guardianship keeps it shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive to “patch holes in the soul” is specific and drives concrete choices (pressing the Tower into bark, offering her tomorrows). Her contradiction—reckless yet gentle—plays on the page in action and dialogue with Ardan. Embodied emotion (“sap beaded like blood,” tug of futures unraveling) keeps it lived. The final renunciation feels slightly neat (“the last hole in her soul close”) but is largely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elliot’s contradictory impulses—armoring himself with provenance vs. confronting grief—are embodied and culminate in a credible, costly choice to leave hiding and give the cloth away. Micro-choices (turning the cloth, smelling it, pressing it to his chest) reveal value hierarchy. The renunciation of his insulating tactic feels earned by prior beats. No safety‑hedging: he accepts pain as the price of movement.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lila’s motives are precise and particular—grant/tenure ambitions reframed into a gentler ache for understanding—and her micro‑choices under pressure (pressing the seed to her lips, setting it in DINGIR, consenting to the root, refusing the fruit) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. Interiority is embodied through the arboreal/magnetic lexicon and the Akkadian “to unbecome” moment. The renunciation—offering metaphor instead of data—forecloses status paths with felt cost. No safety‑hedging: her “kindly methodical” trait constrains her pacing and choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is concrete—preserve wonder through smelting—and micro-choices (which stories to feed, when to accelerate, whether to transfer the stored wonder) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The internal contradiction of migrating identities is dramatized rather than told. The primary limitation is the near-frictionless ritual: little resistance or error under pressure keeps the struggle refined rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motive—unsealing emotional walls after a career of sealing bunkers—is clear and pressed against her contradictory instinct for safety. The confessions concretize interior conflict, each etch a micro‑choice with cost. Abdication (“She carried no crown…”) reads as an earned renunciation, not a flip. A touch more embodied struggle in the moment of placing the pearl could have edged it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied, with concrete micro‑choices (whispering her name, tearing and re‑scarring the map, playing the unfinished song) revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The medication/river conflict produces live contradiction rather than tidy self‑knowledge. Motivation (seeking self‑forgiveness) remains active and escalates toward an earned renunciation. Minor risk: one or two lines brush label‑speak, but they’re anchored in tactile scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dreamer’s motives are clear and sustained—seeking the lexicon and the lullaby—while her micro‑choices (waiting on the ash‑gray letter, pressing the watch to the watermark, making the trade, choosing release over possession) feel earned. Interiority is lyric rather than psychological but still embodied through tactile actions (breath‑ink, heat, tears). The hesitation before trading “the moment you decided to believe me” is the strongest contradictory impulse on the page. Slight mythic distancing keeps us just shy of a deeper, messier interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motives are precise and pressured: a provenance researcher torn between ceding the violin to the empire and honoring the “dream” it carries. Her micro-choices (tasseography, widening plant-telepathy, moving the violin to the windowsill, bowing it) build a credible arc toward renunciation. Interiority is embodied and character-specific (coffee constellations, ivy images) rather than generic feeling labels. The visible cost—refusing titles and safety for a risky, insurgent propagation—lands.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Her motive—saving the dead’s “last spark” at personal cost—is clear and intensifies at the threshold. The hesitation before infusing the chip embodies credible internal conflict. Specifics (widow’s eyebrow, laugh line) yield character‑particular interiority over labels. The renunciation—surrendering every spark she gathered—reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motives are clear and embodied: forgiveness without contentment compels the climb, and the oath’s weight deepens pressure. Contradictory impulses (tenderness vs. duty; grief vs. resolve) operate simultaneously, culminating in the costly surrender of the hairpin. The relationship crucible with her sister lands credibly in the final planting beat. A faint whiff of tidy acceptance lurks, but the sacrifice and ongoing labor keep it honest.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—professional certainty versus chosen ambiguity—is embodied and active: loosening the cloak, raising the mirror, then opting for a compromise that will anger both sides. The micro‑choices are tactile and morally fraught, not abstract. Her exchange with the smuggler (returning her own seal via the coin pouch, then giving the shard) reveals status and self‑implication. The visible cost—the cloak growing heavier with shared hesitation—earns her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara-Lira’s motive—to teach vanishing by withholding—drives every beat and holds steady under pressure. Embodied detail (iron tug in blood, breath growing younger) grounds the interior stakes. The internal contradiction (kindness via concealment) reads credibly, though she skews more serenely competent than conflicted. The change lands in a felt way as she emerges thirteen, accepting the cost of continual erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“to learn to navigate without moving”) and embodied ritual with the arrowhead ground her. Interiority is particular and image-led rather than labeled, with the key renunciation—becoming a tower—reading as an earned cost. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she rarely wavers or resists, so complexity is more thematic than psychological. The arc is credible but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motives and contradictions are legible and embodied: he arrives to test a keystone yet chooses renunciation, unstrapping crampons and stepping onto mist. His interiority is concrete (salt/snow taste; wet earth scent) and distinct without therapy-speak. The final choice—planting the luminous drop and leaving the keystone—forecloses the path to “extraordinary” with felt cost. Slight softness: the external pressure is minimal, keeping the conflict mostly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Miren’s motive is clear and particular—fulfilling a luminous vow tied to her drowned mother—and her choices (descending at lowest tide, testing books, playing wires, breaking the case, releasing the key) enact that drive. The contradiction between “hiding behind truth” and the vow resolves credibly when she decides to tell the town. Interiority is embodied via synesthetic perception rather than labels. The only slight limitation is that resistance is mostly atmospheric, not interpersonal or logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent: align with “purpose” despite “stellar doubt.” The tension between quiet enthusiasm and doubt animates micro‑choices (coin placement, listening, accepting the backwards prophecy). Bodily and sensory focus (hums, chord shifts, the lens touching her forehead) grounds emotion. The final acceptance of dissolution feels earned, with felt cost implied in her surrender to the light.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (to name/forgive) meets grief and absence; embodied images (hollow ribs, heartbeat restored) ground the lyricism. Micro-choices—aligning the prism, speaking the vow—are specific and earned. Internal contradiction (keeping the dead vs. letting them rest) plays in the moment, not summarized. Slight remove from concrete resistance keeps it just shy of visceral peak.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Calen’s motive (to right the cosmic imbalance) is clean, persistent, and refracted through credible flaw (choosing the bell over the bosun). Contradictory impulses act in scene: doubt widens the crack even as he persists, and he pays with blood, mercury, hair, and the bosun’s name. Interiority is concrete and particular (“lukewarm,” counting drips, coaxing the bell). The final endurance feels earned, with the cost of acknowledged guilt legible.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lila’s motive—transforming solitary guilt into communal truth—is clear and drives concrete micro‑choices (laying photos, pressing the label to glass, speaking the confession). Interiority is embodied and specific, with contradictory impulses (duty vs. fear, truth vs. comfort) active on the page. The mirror’s “forgiveness” moment borders on tidy but remains grounded by the felt cost of her admission. The final stance shift (vigilance redirected to “keeping truth in motion”) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, embodied interiority with credible contradiction: a rigorously logical alchemist who is secretly sentimental. Micro‑choices (unpinning hair, choosing the gentler flame, pressing her palm to the crystal) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The emotional turn from control to surrender feels earned via on‑page observation of the starlings. Slight neatness in the epiphany keeps this from the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, embodied motivation—preserving trust and lives—drives concrete micro‑choices (reweaving, recalibrating torque). The competence bias is strong, with limited contradictory impulses beyond fatigue versus duty, which slightly flattens internal friction. Still, the vow after the rookie’s fall and the tactile decision to revise the entire release sequence show earned endurance with a felt cost. The character reads specific and lived‑in through tool‑use and sensory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—defeating creeping numbness—drives concrete choices (lifting the jar, cracking the seal, proposing “your turn to feel”). The relationship crucible with Kael‑2 produces a credible pivot from confrontation to mutual surrender. Embodied detail (theta rhythm syncing, CSF droplets as micro‑memories) grounds interiority. The only softness is the occasional aphoristic line that risks smoothing contradiction, but cost (relinquishing ownership, exposure to feeling) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—guarding a space for innovation—meets a credible counter‑impulse: fear of trespass and loss of control. Her choices escalate under pressure (planting the seed, descending, dissolving the key), revealing a real cost: surrendering proprietorship. Interiority is image‑driven yet specific (mirrors reflecting intentions, forgetting one’s name) and not therapy‑speak. The renunciation at the end is earned by prior beats rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and idiosyncratic—“restore lost laughter”—and her micro‑choices (throttle modulation, kneeling to “listen,” restarting for a second movement) reveal character under pressure. The mournfully eager contradiction animates her conductorship without sentimentality. Internal sensation (“pressure behind her eyes”) grounds emotion. A slightly declarative insight line reduces ambiguity but doesn’t undercut earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guardian’s motive—keeping the boundary of light intact—is consistent and deepened by its vow to wait and its practiced method. Contradictory impulses (endure vs. engage) surface when it risks action with the echo‑key while preserving stasis as principle. Embodied perception is specific (mist as sentences, snow as semicolons), revealing a distinct psyche. The acolyte’s return tests the guardian’s stance, and giving back the pendant shows a credible, value‑driven choice with modest but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and consistent: he seeks to “interrupt destiny” by reimagining the crozier’s break as a door. Interiority is embodied and specific (pressure behind eyes; copper taste; blood on the silver seam). The decisive costs—blood and renunciation of obedience—are earned by the prior approximations. Stoic sensitivity under pressure reads as a constraint and an enabler rather than a label.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s goal is clear and particular, and his actions (climbing, tuning, chalking the credo) align with that drive. Interiority is specific (“tune…by discarding assumptions”), giving him a distinctive inner method. However, pressure on his psyche remains gentle; contradictory impulses surface briefly but never truly pinch, so the transformation feels low‑friction. The cost—relinquishing old beliefs and relocating grief into the sphere—is felt but not wrestled for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.7)
    Cass’s motivation crystallizes clearly (“to merge parallel timelines”), and her choices—radioing, aligning the hourglass—flow from her resilient, service‑oriented nature. Interiority is concise but character‑specific; she acts with calm determination rather than exposition. The primary weakness is limited contradiction under pressure; her competence faces little internal friction. The cost lands in her solitude—“Cass alone remembered”—but is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive (to “discover the texture of connection”) cleanly drives concrete choices—stitching lullabies, net‑weaving, throttling the mirror image, then surrendering to become the seam. Interiority is embodied via tactile actions (threading, tasting iron) rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (discipline vs. surrender; fear vs. acceptance) operate simultaneously and culminate in an earned renunciation. Minor wish: a sharper on‑page hesitation beat right before the final surrender could deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—grief plus professional calling drives her to defy the council and leave the known grid. Interiority is embodied (pressure as forgiveness; the anchor link’s heft) and character‑specific. The shift from instructor to transgressor to teacher feels earned, though her swift fluency with alien method verges on ease. The wife’s lesson grounds the leap and keeps it credible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s profession, tools, and “persistently curious” trait motivate each choice, and her embodied attentiveness (kneeling, adjusting the aid, speaking messages) feels lived. The moment she reframes her aim—protecting vulnerable voices including the dead—tracks cleanly to her vow. Internal contradiction is light; she accepts obligation with minimal friction, softening the sense of struggle. Still, the small cost—carrying the burden of others’ stories—reads credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s fear-purpose tension is embodied from the first beat (counting heartbeats against the groan) through the decision to sing and stay with the cables. Motivations are clear and rise under environmental pressure; micro-choices (timing the doors, whispering names, lifting the fleck) reveal priorities. The internal contradiction (claustrophobia vs. duty to the unremembered) culminates credibly in an earned reorientation. Slight softness: the success of the repair sequence feels nearly frictionless, muting the felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clean and intensifies: the radio’s “defragment” and the misprinted death certificate drive concrete choices (dropping the shard, tracing the mandala, stepping into the vortex). Embodied contradictions—“digital ghost” yet counting heartbeats—are dramatized rather than labeled. The heartbeat‑for‑stroke exchange creates visible cost and reveals values under pressure. The final acceptance (no longer counting) reads earned rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and compelling—she’s the last speaker executing a charged inheritance—and her micro‑choices (entering the tunnel, naming textures, lifting the diamond) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile translation rather than abstract labels. The primary limitation is a relative lack of contradictory impulses or visible internal friction under peak pressure. The endurance/renunciation at the end (ordinary words, cooled copper) reads earned and costs her something intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vale’s motives (protect/find Orion; decode the missing) are clear and intensify as the phone surges, culminating in the choice to fuse arrowhead and phone and accept a mission. Interiority is embodied and specific (frost on ladder rungs; arrowhead as “private planet”), with tension between bitterness and wonder. Micro‑choices under pressure are distinct and revealing (listening, laughing, pressing the flint, etching coordinates, leaving the garden). The transformation into “both researcher and cryptid” feels earned with a felt cost rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (“uproot the spell that petrified beauty”) and embodied fear/resolve interplay drive choices, especially when she converts fear into signal. Contradictory impulses (hesitation vs. commitment) are dramatized rather than told. Micro-choices—stepping forward, increasing tempo, funneling fear—align with her ethos. The cost registers in the pendant’s loss and the risky stance on the dissolving bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Six’s motive—“to foster something the war had orphaned: trust”—is specific and consistent, and his micro‑choices (uncorking the bottle, sending Mercy, opening the hatch, accepting the coin) embody it under pressure. Interiority is rendered through tactile perception (the bottle’s warmth, the storm’s “shudder”) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is subtle but present: a rebel who serves a communal duty at personal risk. The relationship with Lila sharpens his values without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The carpenter’s vow of silence versus his impulse to sing creates a credible internal contradiction that drives action. His choices (following the chime, singing, seating the halo in the carousel) align with a maker’s temperament and are embodied through tactile craft. The emotional cost of breaking his long‑held identity is felt but understated. Secondary pressure is minimal, so conflict remains mostly internal/lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mireille’s motive—listening for where stories live—is clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (avoiding creaks, following the scarf, touching the coordinate) revealing character. The “provisional” belief earns credibility and shades her risk. However, internal contradiction remains understated; the piece favors poise over contested impulse. The cost registers as stewardship weight rather than an emotionally fraught trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motivation (recover/vitalize the runaway dream) escalates into a meaningful renunciation when she gives the palette away. Interiority is specific and embodied (paying “a drop of her own shadow,” tasting “iron and lilac”). Contradictory impulses are present—pursuit versus the dream’s preference for “almost”—and the final endurance/letting‑go forecloses a path with felt cost. Slightly idealized composure under pressure keeps this just shy of transcendent complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and particular—freeing Aelira’s suppressed melody—and his tactics (disorienting himself, threading the ribbon) align tightly with that desire. Interiority is sensorial and specific (“smelled of cedar and thunderstorm”), avoiding stock emotions. The locksmith’s competence flirts with frictionless, yielding limited contradictory impulses under peak pressure. Reunion with Aelira lands, but the visible cost to him remains largely implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive—to recover a stolen decade—drives concrete, escalating choices (arranging shards, pressing the dark one to the mushroom, lifting the cap, singing). Interiority is specific and embodied through sensory recall (cider, pipe smoke) rather than labels. A credible flaw—belief that folklore “never collected debts”—complicates her agency and pays off. Slightly limited contradiction on the page (curiosity vs. fear is implied more than dramatized) keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—reversing her younger self’s exile by mentoring resilience—drives every choice, and her “combative tenderness” provides a credible internal contradiction. Embodied actions (walking backwards, breath on glass, kneeling ultimatum) reveal character under pressure. The ultimatum—“Drink… or we both remain ghosts”—makes the cost explicit and personal. Minor limitation: interiority is implied through ritual rather than rendered as thought, but it remains character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Arin’s motive—to preserve the color of wonder—drives concrete choices and culminates in a costly renunciation. Interiority is vivid (“surplus of vision felt like a leak”) and embodied through craft gestures. Internal contradiction is present but gentle rather than combative, making the sacrifice feel inevitable more than wrestled‑through. Still, the cost lands and the knife‑planting promises a meaningful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motive—to relieve accrued grief by untying silence—reads clear and consistent, and her competence is dramatized through tactile micro‑choices with the net and needle. The fisherman’s presence adds relational pressure and a tender teaching dynamic. Internal contradiction is modest (duty vs. burden) rather than adversarial, keeping the arc more endurance than rupture. The closing promise to return registers a credible cost without false heroics.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is precise and consistent—she’s driven to decode the tear and the chapel’s silence—and her methodical choices (projector setup, frame alignment, the decision to press and then leave the map) track cleanly. The “shielded openness” gives her interiority specificity, though true internal contradiction is subtle rather than strongly dramatized. The visible cost is quiet—she forfeits the map and accepts the wound’s truth—but it lands. A touch more friction or risk in the chapel could have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s quietly analytic drive is embodied in concrete choices—rewinding, charting the “equation,” opening the globe, and ultimately leaving it behind. Contradictory impulses (to decipher vs. to release) coexist on the page and resolve through an earned renunciation. Dee’s presence lightly pressures the stance without hijacking agency. Emotional texture is specific and embodied rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—articulating long‑suppressed needs—drives concrete choices (pressing the cloudbloom, painting glyphs, singing). Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual and sensory triggers (“rain on copper”), not labels. The internal contradiction (silence vs. song) is dramatized via the ghost becoming harmony. The change feels earned with a modest but felt cost: vulnerability and relinquishing the protective silence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lina’s motive (defy “Burn the diary” to restore the captain’s joy) is specific and consistently dramatized through tactile micro‑choices: using prism light, donning the cracked goggles, placing them on him. Interiority is embodied (“gloved palms,” “throat tightened”) and contradiction is present via affectionate detachment versus urgent care. The relationship shift at the roof is earned by prior choices. The only softness is low resistance—her decoding flow feels a touch too smooth for the risk implied.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s motive—proving that “empty spaces remember”—is clear, rooted in her training and grief, and her micro-choices (logging emotional signatures, addressing specific clouds) reveal character under pressure. The epiphany is earned through tactile beats (the telescope’s weight/warmth, the cloud reflecting her face). Internal contradiction (data vs. metaphor) is present but resolves a bit smoothly, with limited on‑page friction. Still, the embodied specificity (mentor’s last breath, father’s storm) gives the arc credible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motive (to mirror the sky before demolition) is clear and her micro‑choices (prying the safe, translating the coin, embossing the mural, deciding to leave) align under pressure. Embodied tension (“heart races, but her hand remains steady”) gives credible contradiction. Face blindness is integrated as limitation and worldview rather than a label. The endurance/renunciation at the end (walking out, leaving the library to fall) carries felt cost and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s curiosity and methodical temperament are vividly rendered and consistently drive action (phrasebook → hopscotch → lens). The internal friction between caution (Captain Rens’s warning) and hunger for discovery is present but lightly contested. Embodied perception (dust motes, warm center square) grounds emotion. The felt cost of defying orders is implied rather than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks the “rhythm of repair” tied to her mother’s disappearance and her chosen title. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual (eclipse-light, gears) and memory glimpses in the mirror hall. Contradictory impulses are light; she meets the cost with near‑serene acceptance rather than fraught ambivalence. The closing sacrifice is earned but could register more internal friction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Luma’s altruism and constraint (can’t speak, chooses chalk) motivate coherent action, and Kiran’s curiosity-to-leadership arc is clean. Internal contradiction is light—most emotion is archetypal rather than messy or individuated. The sacrifice (Luma dissolving into the bell) lands as a credible price derived from her values. Secondary characters (mechanic, twins, archivist) add texture but apply minimal personal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear motive (to vouchsafe the lullaby) and embodied hesitation (“Her fingers trembled...”) ground the choice. The mirrors’ montage of saved-and-lost lives adds real internal pressure and visible cost. Interiority remains specific to her craft and objects (gear, pane), not generic. Slight limit: conflict is largely one decisive ritual rather than layered micro‑choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nadia’s reluctant duty versus her desire for release generates credible tension, and her choice to spend the season’s nut to save strangers reads as a costly, character‑true turn. Interiority is embedded in tactile, specific action rather than abstract summary. The contradiction—caretaker who never touches, seeker of release who spends her chance—is clear and earned. A hair more on‑page friction or doubt at the peak could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation—atonement reframed through a chemist’s mind—drives tactile choices (mixing catalysts, fusing chrysalis to quartz). Contradictory impulses (science vs absolution; keeping vs leaving the chrysalis) operate simultaneously. Embodied grief and occupational detail keep emotions concrete. The “formula she had never dared to write” skirts tidy epiphany but is earned by the preceding ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, idiosyncratic motive—“serve stories, become free”—drives concrete micro‑choices (counting absences, incising the pool, planting the seed). Internal contradiction (vendor vs. listener; presence vs. absence) is dramatized rather than told. Embodied feeling comes through tactile ritual (tags fluttering, grammar tugging ankles) more than bodily affect, which keeps a slight coolness. The renunciation of control at the end reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—Lira returns “to sandpaper those rough memories”—and her micro‑choices (tasting air, reading pools, finally subsuming the broth) reveal a distinctive value hierarchy. The internal cost is embodied when she nearly drowns in the lord’s grief yet holds it “like a too‑hot spoonful.” Relationship pressure is mostly indirect (the lord is off‑page), but her choices still transform his state credibly. Emotional texture is specific, not generic, and carries through to the closing culinary act.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sora’s motive—to bridge isolated “silos” through plural language—drives clear, purposeful actions across the scene. Interiority is mostly implied through tactile choices (pressing the weight, language selection) rather than dramatized contradiction, so internal conflict reads soft. Her “empathetically decisive” trait is shown (listening to the elevator, answering in many tongues), not told. The arc lands credibly but without a felt personal cost beyond labor and caretaking.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks to revive generationally “abandoned dreams”—and her actions (pressing the jagged mirror to her temple, surrendering to memory flow) align. Interiority is vivid, though largely one-directional toward surrender; contradictions (fear vs. longing, self vs. inheritance) are implied more than dramatized. The felt cost—absorbing the grandmother’s voice as a permanent internal chorus—lands but could be sharpened with a bolder moment of resistance. Overall strong, with a touch of abstraction limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s goal is clear and consistent, and her choices (taking the violet path, planting a seed, folding the dragon back) align under pressure. Interiority is vivid and embodied (knees stinging, tastes of iron/ozone), though internal contradiction is limited; she faces time pressure more than moral conflict. The felt cost lands in the decision to plant only one seed and carry the rest within her pulse. A deeper clash between duty and risk could have raised the grade.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (“to restore what was lost”) drives each micro‑choice, and embodied perception (“throat aches with borrowed sorrow”) grounds emotion. The sculptor’s tactics evolve credibly from listening to entering the fracture to exhaling. Internal contradiction is subtle (quiet reverence vs. the bold act of sounding), not overt, which slightly limits depth. The felt cost appears in her body and in the widened cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motives (redemption through precision and pattern) are concrete and embodied via the dented stone. His micro‑choices—measuring footfalls, accepting the keeper’s test, placing the knight—align with a consistent flaw/virtue set. The interior conflict (guilt vs. hard‑won grace) is present if understated. The renunciation at the end (not returning as tutor of princes) lands as an earned shift with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s pacifism is tested against her “almost struck back” memory, and her micro‑choices (tuning, singing, refusing force) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. Embodied perception (sawdust, ozone, tools as “reluctant soldiers”) grounds emotion. The cost—reopening a sealed regret—lands via the bruised thumbprint. Slight softness: success arrives with little struggle on the page, muting contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ari’s motive—coaxing the seed open by “serenity within motion”—is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (hair as tie, swaying cradle, nightly returns). Her olfactory interiority gives specificity without stock emotion. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance, so change reads more as deepening than struggle. The final insight feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motive (to find the orchard’s resilience) is clear, and her competence under pressure reads specific and embodied. The fear/unease at inversion plays against duty, yielding credible micro‑choices (pressing deeper, inserting the tip). Interiority remains largely externalized through sensory focus rather than richly contradictory impulses. Still, the final act feels earned by prior perception and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (“to cultivate foresight in action”) is dramatized through concrete choices: silk‑mapping, proposing the trade, and mastering the door rhythm. Relationship pressure with Mara reframes duty, and the badge exchange literalizes responsibility. Interiority is shown via tactile perception (wind, silk, bruise‑blue dawn) rather than label‑speak. Slightly limited contradiction on the page—she adapts quickly with little visible doubt—keeps this shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied through synesthetic perception, and her guarded silence gives the central act a credible price. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little resistance beyond the inert stone, so struggle reads more devotional than pressured. The decision to expend her stored hush lands, but ambiguity about what she loses going forward is lightly sketched. The sculptor’s late arrival adds validation, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority drives every micro‑choice, from orienting driftwood to refusing to play the flute until a new understanding forms. The conflict between “keeping as holding tight” and “keeping as letting go” is dramatized rather than told, and the renunciation at the end feels earned. Embodied perception (“air grew denser,” “sigil burned black”) grounds emotion. The visible cost is the relinquishment of her old identity as a wall.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear motive—solve emotion like an equation—meets contradictory lived pressure as empathy leaks and the borrowed persona frays. Her decision to reverse the process and accept the cost (halo cracking, prints ashing, loss of the borrowed self) is earned. Embodied specifics—metal taste, press’s breath—ground interiority. Minor hedge: the astronomer’s whisper risks outsourcing agency but she reclaims it in the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s conflicting impulses—professional anonymity versus a dawning desire to seed wonder—are concrete and embodied (the thumb on the pendant, the knees clicking). Her final choice to relinquish courier identity by gifting the pendant reads earned by prior beats. Secondary figures apply soft but relevant pressure that reveals her values. The cost—letting go of Rell’s approval and the defined role—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific—prove a thesis through an occult method—and her micro‑choices (pressing the prism, asking it to translate, enduring “symmetry,” leaving the prism) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The involuntary extraction of her own grief creates credible internal conflict and visible cost. Embodied sensation (“hand remained firmly grounded”) grounds emotion beyond labels. If anything, her renunciation lands gently rather than with a sharper, riskier self‑implication.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive is precise and persistent: to send “return” to her brother at any cost, culminating in the bead-and-puzzle sacrifice. Interiority is particular and embodied (dew, bead pulse, thimble barter), not generic. The internal contradiction—fierce hope vs. acceptance of one-way loss—registers at the end as Earned Stasis. Minor ding: her doubt and dread could tighten earlier to heighten pressure on the mid‑story choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s motives and contradictions are clear: she fears losing her brother’s last smile yet chooses to barter a memory to save the orchards. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft and sensory recall (quenching steel in runoff, the silk’s tightening). The cost registers on the page as a hollowed laughter and a reconfigured bond (“You gave me away, yet here I am”). Her quiet determination scales credibly from refusal to strategic sacrifice, earning the change.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motive—to learn the shard’s purpose and the “withheld truth”—is clear and deepens credibly as she encounters her younger self and the console. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (tasting metal’s memory; the chord that “tasted of ozone and regret”). The final renunciation (embedding the shard) forecloses further traversal with a felt cost. Slight neatness in the epiphany edges toward tidy rather than internally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence, skepticism about ghosts, and caretaker ethic create a credible, felt interior engine. His micro-choices—stacking stones, setting the sea glass on the lens, deciding to “bottle” safety—align with his learned codes and deepen under pressure. The contradiction of believing in tides, not ghosts, yet heeding the widow lands as earned evolution, not a flip. The visible cost is accepting the ache’s stewardship inside himself.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motive—“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is clear and enacted through specific micro‑choices (trimming, aligning, steering). Interiority is vivid but largely single‑valence (gleeful, exultant), with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The embodied cost arrives via self‑transformation and loss of the lighthouse, but he never doubts or resists, limiting complexity. Still, reactions to the fracture vision and tool use reveal a coherent, particular psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive is clear and character‑particular: a watchful artisan seeking how stories magnetize, complicated by a donor heart that carries Lira’s unfinished urgency. Interiority is embodied through sensory craft (tracking blues, the heart’s lurch) rather than labels. The internal contradiction—watchfulness versus permeability—culminates credibly in “watchful no longer.” The only slight limit is that resistance costs are more conceptual than dramatized through a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s desire “to discover what trees witness” cleanly motivates her ascent and careful reassembly. Interiority is concrete through tactile acts (tracing arcs, feeling sap), but contradictory impulses and visible struggle are minimal, making the journey feel low-friction. The final acceptance feels earned yet largely unopposed. More pressure or a conflicted hesitation would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and persistent—she aims to preserve the orchard/realm—and her actions align under pressure (kneeling to name the first peach; deploying the final tapestry). Interiority is embodied through sensory choices rather than labels (“air tasted of iron and lullabies”). The inner contradiction (clinging vs. letting go) is present but could surface more explicitly in on-page hesitation. The final cost—allowing her memories to scatter—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—compassion as self‑erasure vs. self‑mercy—are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (descending, “staying while leaving,” refusing the map). The insight about compassion reorients her prior identity with a felt cost (foreclosing her old performative giving). Interiority is specific and embodied (“candles…dripping light,” mirrored spines listening) rather than labeled. The arc lands as credible Earned Stasis rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (bearing witness to disappearances) evolves into a choice to plant—an earned reorientation with felt cost (“I will forget a little”). Interiority is specific and embodied (ash, crumbs, frost) rather than abstract. The tension between vigilance and the desire to uncloak plays on the page. Minor safety in calibration—she adapts smoothly—keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s duty-bound meticulousness meets a felt rupture when her own vow surfaces, creating a credible pivot from measuring to releasing. Embodied cues (trembling fingers, warmed slide, liquid light) anchor her interiority. The conflict—duty to preserve versus the human cost of holding on—feels specific to her long tenure. A touch more contradictory impulse on the page at the decision moment could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s conflicting impulses—betray Roe to save her father vs. honor the truce—are embodied through tactile choices (thumb on the recorder, fob to lips, snapping the reel). Her final renunciation is earned by the setup and Roe’s photo reveal, with an on‑page cost to her father’s commutation prospects. Interiority remains concrete and character‑specific, avoiding platitudes. Minor convenience in Roe’s understanding doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motives (to learn why people carry weather; to prevent Mara’s storm) drive concrete choices: following the taste, initiating the formal greeting, and pressing the ring to her wrist. The skeptic-to-shared‑climate shift is earned and costs the narrator the ring and a prior identity. Interiority is distinctive and embodied (taste, metal memory), though the struggle proceeds with minimal resistance. A touch more friction under pressure would deepen contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and particular (indigo, apricot, bruise; linseed and thunderstorm), with a credible contradiction between fleeing art and being drawn back. Micro‑choices under pressure—sketching the lock’s “former soul,” uncorking the vial, hanging the lock around her neck—reveal a hierarchy of values. The renunciation of her avoidance (“not escape but return”) lands with felt cost. No dialogue or on‑page other character, but the mother’s shadow functions as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysandra’s motive—recovering and returning lost conversations while confronting her own half-truths—is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (piecing the map, choosing to speak apologies, engaging strangers) reveal a credible internal shift. The embodied tells (plants wilting near dishonesty, mint-scented apologies) ground her contradiction between performative beauty (gilded ink) and plainspoken need. The change to plain rice paper and the plan to read aloud register a felt renunciation. External resistance is light, but the emotional price is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—he seeks to “preserve the color of wonder”—and his choices (offering the bronze petals; catching and carrying the tear) align under pressure. The seasonally mute trait meaningfully shapes his stance as a listener-creator. Internal contradiction (preserve vs. let wonder stay wild) is present and resolved as partnership, not possession. Slightly low friction—the ritual mostly succeeds—keeps this shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lumen’s longing/fear contradiction is vivid and drives choices: he rejects evacuation in favor of containment, dissolves the artifacts, and walks the flame. Interiority is embodied (static, warmth, the petal on his cheek) rather than labeled. Micro‑choices under pressure reveal values with cost (sacrificing cherished objects to enact a ritual). The only slight hedge is the tidy log line, which leans toward summary rather than felt ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motive—to listen and heal—drives each choice (investigate, gather stories, deploy the locket), rendered through tactile perception (“felt a faint vibration”). Internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance and rarely wavers, so struggle feels cushioned. Competence is balanced by a credible, quiet cost (risking curfew; shouldering communal grief). The final act reads earned by prior listening rather than a sudden gift.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motive and methods are crystalline, embodied in dance, breath, and tactile engagement with tools and space. The competence is compelling, though internal contradiction is muted—she rarely wavers, which slightly softens felt risk. Micro‑choices (waiting for the spider line, tumbling the die, fusing the lock) reveal a clear values hierarchy without therapy‑speak. The lingering cost is principled rather than painful, but it reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—recovering her mother’s lost memories—is clear, embodied, and consistent, with occupational detail lending specificity. Her micro-choices (following the heaviness, prying up the tile, dropping the flowers, tasting a droplet) align with that drive. Internal contradiction is light; she’s determined rather than conflicted, so stakes register more as ache than dilemma. Still, her embodied sensitivity to gravity and ritual knowledge makes her feel singular, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear from the outset (hush the prophecy before dawn), and her hesitation at “would she choose to silence the world to save it?” provides credible internal conflict. Interiority is embodied through tactile, specific images (pressing the wing to her lips; mapping silence). The final renunciation—transforming from caging silence to listening—reads earned. Slight distance from concrete human stakes keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear desire (“to learn the language of old buildings”) meets embodied doubt (the rehearsed laugh; opening mail “meant for a ghost”). The widow applies pressure that reshapes the narrator’s stance through lessons and ritual. The branded chest is a concrete cost linked to accepting stewardship. The internal contradiction—skeptic politeness versus longing to be spoken through—earns the closing acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motive is explicit and propulsive: rescue her mother’s mind before the garden dissolves. Her internal tension—sorrow versus the fierceness of independence—plays through tactile micro‑choices (matching and quickening her heartbeat, lifting the shell, not looking back). Reactions remain embodied and specific, not labeled. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting the garden’s loss and the voice’s silence) feels earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to “forgive the unfinished” by undoing her treason) is clear and deepens under pressure as she risks identity and legacy. Interiority is embodied through tactile choices—the thorn, the blood, the trembling point—rather than abstract labels. Contradictory impulses (self‑preservation vs. accountability; guilt vs. love for brother) operate simultaneously. If anything, the monk’s maxim edges toward overt statement but doesn’t undercut the earned final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation (to learn why some people echo) is clear and sustained, and the final choice between freeing voices and preserving them reads as a credible Earned Stasis with felt cost. Interiority is textured and embodied (boots on fossil beds, ribs vibrating), not label‑only. The contradiction—compassion for trapped voices versus reverence for their beauty—surfaces on the page and drives the decision. The stranger adds relational pressure without stealing POV clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Nadia’s motive—salvaging something pure from grief and catastrophe—is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (frosting the globe, arranging candles, knotting threads) reveal a meticulous, haunted temperament. Internal tension surfaces between exposing the drowned’s truths and yearning for a purified remnant. The brother’s jersey detail adds human cost without overexplaining. The earned endurance at the end (carrying the locket) forecloses denial with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Her motive—honoring maintenance as rebellion—is specific and consistent, embodied in tactile choices (climbing the parapet, whistling, using the whisk, handing it over). Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (nets, knots, froth), and the guard moment reveals character under pressure with status softening. The visible cost is modest (relinquishing the heirloom whisk) but real. Internal contradiction is gentle rather than sharp, keeping the arc more devotional than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s drive to “excavate truth from the nation's comfortable lies” is clear and consistent, and her debunker stance clashes credibly with the painful revelations about her father. Her embodied perception (dosimeter, iodine/cinnamon wind) reveals character under pressure. The final renunciation—planting the Apple—feels earned and morally costly. Slight room remains for deeper moment‑to‑moment contradiction during the decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cassia’s motive—to midwife a “first word” and a new dawn—drives concrete choices (tuning gaps, feeding numbers into the receiver, standing under lightning). Interiority is rendered through tactile action (solder burns, ozone taste) rather than label-speak. Contradiction is present but subtle (loneliness vs. congregation, faith in storms vs. allegiance to echoes). The final endurance—accepting a not‑gentle dawn—reads earned though the on‑page personal cost is mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear—he comes “to sweeten the silence” and translate between generations—and his choices (capturing, sealing, then releasing sounds) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual, the sob he denies, and the father memory threaded via the dawn whistle. Internal contradiction is subtle (a hoarder of sound who ultimately releases it), yielding a credible endurance/renunciation. The cost is felt in letting the jars go and the music box “unwinding like a life.”

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lira’s motive—protect the artifact by translating its grief—is clear and consistently embodied (calculating resonance while her heart “winced”). The micro‑choices (returning the key, selecting the thinnest ice, modulating pitch) align with her “logically emotional” nature. However, internal conflict is gentle and largely uncontested; we seldom see her falter or pay a personal price beyond fatigue. The crypt keeper exerts minimal interpersonal pressure, keeping the crucible mostly internal.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—unyoking the town through a “patient revolution”—is clear and consistently enacted via moon‑tracking, cairn‑marking, and leading the vigil. Interiority is embedded in tactile choices and images (ear to ice, mirrored disks), not labels. However, she meets little real resistance; ambiguity or contradiction in her stance is minimal, keeping the emotional cost modest. The elders function more as chorus than crucible, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s “watchfully calm” discipline collides with rising personal stakes, yielding credible micro‑choices (no flashlight; measuring angles; speaking aloud despite training). The internal contradiction—empirical detachment vs. filial grief—stays embodied (pulse, breath, tactile noticing) and culminates in a earned stance shift. Her final actions (leaving the lantern, choosing a new report) align with revealed motives without feeling neat. Minor neatness in the journal inscription edges toward convenience but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s guilt-driven motive (he reported Elias’s workshop) cleanly propels concrete action, and his embodied choices—driving, learning the craft, relinquishing the heart—align under pressure. The internal contradiction (penitentiary chaplain who caused harm) remains active in scene and earns the closing shift. Elias’s limited but pivotal presence in the chapel crystallizes the relationship change without overexplaining. Minor softness: the acceptance is swift, though plausible given the object’s provenance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ludo’s want is vivid and consistent, and her agency drives the key turns (launching, conducting light, diving, striking). Interiority is stylized via the “yearning algorithm,” which reads particular rather than generic. Some complexity is sacrificed to purity of motive—there’s little contradictory impulse under pressure. The Orrin–Ludo dynamic adds texture but not decisive interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motive (to recover Leo/what’s been erased) is clear and intensifies under the 0117 deadline; her choice to violate protocol and then go rogue reads earned. Interiority is concrete (heartbeat syncing to 117; the patch warming) rather than label-only. A flicker of convenience (the locker opening with the patch) leans magical, but her micro-choices drive each turn. Internal conflict is present but light; she leans decisively toward action with little wavering.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive and method are precise and embodied—she “tastes emotions,” sorts them by texture, and makes concrete micro‑choices with the mirrors. The internal contradiction is lighter; she reads as hyper‑competent with little visible falter, which softens felt risk. The cost lands via the fragment losing future‑sight, but her personal price remains largely conceptual rather than painfully dramatized. Still, actions consistently align with her core drive and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motives are specific and evolving: from euthanasia tourist to listener of endings, her renunciation is earned by on‑page experiences (the storm, the droplets singing). Interiority is vivid and embodied (ice language, “fold in patience”) without therapy‑speak. Dialogue is minimal but distinct (“Your ending is not here”) and redirects her. The cost—staying to listen “until the last floe melts”—lands as a lived commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear motivation (to “rediscover,” not resurrect) and embodied, contradictory impulses (needing her witness yet choosing renunciation) drive credible micro‑choices. Handling the letter, aligning it with the grain, then burning it escalates interior pressure into action. The admission that “she might have been right” costs him the talisman and a fantasy of possession. The final vow to tend the gap reads as earned stasis with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Her motive—to preserve the prophet’s fading echo—is clear and embodied through specific choices (the diagonal cut, the choice of silence, the touch on the parapet). The internal turn from mourning to stewardship reads earned by the surrender of control. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. communal trust) coexist on the page without tidy moralizing. Secondary figures (monks) apply quiet pressure by method, not dialogue, keeping focus on her.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s motives and methods are clear and consistent, and her quiet agency organizes the scene’s turns. However, interior conflict is minimal; she remains serenely competent with little contradiction under pressure. The trumpet man’s beat adds an embodied emotional register but centers him only briefly. The ending’s renunciation (empty case; moving on) is credible but lightly costed in character terms.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear motive (decode the library’s growth) reframes into surrender, with concrete micro‑choices: listening, speaking “Mother,” joining and then replacing the crystals. Interiority is embodied through acoustic imagery and tears; the “reticent” trait is tested by the act of testifying. The internal contradiction—decoding vs. yielding—surfaces credibly. Stakes remain largely internal, keeping pressure subtle rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—he must capture “the sound of growing older”—and every micro‑choice (driftwood markers, chalk spiral, stepping into the center, pressing chalk to screen) aligns with that drive. Interiority is embodied through sensory specifics (magnetic dust, delayed gull-cry) and the flaw of “precognitively forgetful” meaningfully constrains tactics. The contradiction—clinging to echoes while forgetting—plays through action, not summary. The closing endurance/renunciation (becoming a listening shell) lands with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s drive to fix what spins out of control collides with the dawning urge to surrender, yielding concrete micro‑choices (listening, recalibrating breath, refusing to stop the hand, burning the film). Interiority is embodied and particular (“read the world by the sound of a leaf falling”). The final renunciation—letting the camera spend itself—feels earned with visible cost. Slight idealization of competence remains but never softens the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and embodied—she promises a flawless goodbye and builds a plan from “decisive kindness.” Interiority arrives through sensory specificity (the scent of hope, the groove’s “secret smile”) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (fear vs. exhaled hope) but present. A touch more visible struggle or risk of failure would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained—find where shadows go at noon and confront the sealed Awakening—and her micro‑choices (keying the automaton, finding the hidden door, choosing to insert the spoon) align. Interiority is spare but precise, with embodied cues (pulse matching the ticking) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is mild (a rehearsed reunion vs. quiet deliberation) and could be sharpened. The sacrifice of the automaton registers as a credible cost tied to her drive.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ivy’s “forgiving skeptic” stance drives every choice—from pocketing the tooth to requesting the original child and initiating the ritual—and her skepticism bends rather than vanishes. Embodied, profession‑specific details (vet tweezers, bone‑setting) ground her inner conflict. The girl’s guilt and Ivy’s response create a credible, intimate crucible. Minor softness: the emotional price Ivy pays is more conceptual than dramatized pain.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—to share light without fire—anchors every choice, and the sacrifice of her mother‑charged sea glass is a felt cost. Interiority is specific (counting heartbeats, apology to shark) and embodied. The internal tension between memory and communal need (“weigh memory against hope”) surfaces credibly. A faint lack of friction beyond ritual steadies the arc just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motives are concrete and embodied—she comes to act, not to hide—and her micro‑choices (filing thorns, splicing the rose, refusing an online reply) reveal a complex tenderness under pressure. Contradictory impulses (hurt versus forgiveness) coexist and are resolved through action rather than summary. The cost of choosing mercy over accusation is legible and earned. A slight tidiness at the end keeps it from feeling messier, lived‑in at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: she comes “to collect the shapes of different hopes” and to let her “last protagonist die.” Interiority is specific and embodied (mud smelling of printer’s ink; salt baptizing the fragment), with a credible confession—“used beauty to avoid truth.” Micro‑choices accrue under pressure (pressing the shell, accepting tokens, speaking names). The change at the end—renunciation and release—feels earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s goal is crisp and embodied through tactile choices (pressing the tendril to bark, winding the crank, singing the three songs). Interiority is specific via the grandmother’s song-memory, but internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little doubt or pushback. The success comes smoothly, limiting felt struggle. Still, motive and actions align cleanly and earn the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motive—safekeeping starlight tied to her mother and the darkened sky—is clear and embodied through precise micro‑choices (heel‑to‑toe steps, glacier‑soaked paper, grief held back). Internal tension between grief and the required patience acts in scene, not summary. The endurance at the end reads as an earned refusal to hurry. A touch more contradiction under peak pressure could push it into the rare tier.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen’s motive—to capture and file wonder before the wounded season closes—drives concrete micro‑choices (angle adjustments, not touching the moth‑memories, soldering the crack). His “peripheral focus” is dramatized as a constraint that reveals a temperament of restraint over indulgence. The renunciation at the peak (choosing storage over contact) reads as a credible, character‑specific cost. Emotional texture stays embodied and avoids generalized labels.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear—free herself by measuring and transferring burdens—and actions track cleanly to that goal. Embodied emotion is vivid (weights pressing “like wet wool,” ribs calcifying), and micro‑choices (flame angle, breath control, sequencing small→medium→largest) reveal values. Internal contradiction is subtler; guilt drives her but there’s little simultaneous push‑pull beyond endurance vs. release. The earned endurance and partial self‑petrification register as a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s motives are specific and embodied: fear of unleashing the roar versus the need to “contain what cannot stay.” Micro‑choices under a live clock (thumb presses, ignoring the whistle) reveal values with cost. Interiority is character‑particular, filtered through circus memory and craft. The renunciation of paralysis for portable grief reads earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives are clear and pressure-tested: she wants to retrieve time and reconcile with her ghosts, yet refuses to surrender the camera wheel. Contradictory impulses surface credibly in the trade for “the taste of metal” and the later renunciation of ambitions. Micro-choices (gathering fragments, refusal, then release) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. The final stance—thirty-three and staying—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—turn abandonment into possibility—and her micro-choices (aligning the sextant, rerouting conduits, feeding the vine) embody that drive. Interiority is specific and filtered through an engineer’s perception, though internal contradiction and visible struggle are muted. The endurance cost (working through the night, accepting that passengers won’t return) lands but remains subtle. The closing renunciation—resurrection over repair, reorienting goodbye into hello—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to reconcile with an abandoned dream—is clear and embodied in specific choices (kneeling to “let the chill enter,” redrawing the mechanism, refusing commerce: “no longer for sale”). Contradictory impulses (fear the world would break it vs. yearning to begin again) operate simultaneously and are tested by the garden’s “invitation.” The renunciation carries a felt cost (turning away from sponsors and product) scaled to this length. Interior detail is character‑particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to find Vesper and understand the “architecture of lies”) is specific and consistently enacted through concrete choices—listening, aligning false charts, weaving the rope, stepping onto the canal. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. surrender to the ritual; certainty vs. instinct) surface credibly, especially when she names her own lies. Embodied details—heat branding her skin, rope at her waist—keep emotion grounded rather than abstract. The renunciation (cutting the tether) reads as a real cost consistent with her drive.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hara’s drive to preserve hand-knowledge is specific and embodied (velvet pouches, trembling hands, “Teach me”). The quiet renunciation of seed-hunting for gesture-teaching lands as a credible change. Internal contradiction (collector vs. weaver) is present but understated; a little more friction under pressure could heighten cost. Actions align cleanly with motive, revealing humility and reverence without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear motive (to perform an obituary rite and map healing) manifests through concrete acts: warming the weft, writing on air, laying the thread. Contradictory impulses—summoning versus accepting absence—play in-scene (“rehearsing loss rather than reversing it”). The renunciation—“walked the path once more, this time without expectation of arrival”—feels earned and costly. Interiority is specific and embodied, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Halric’s motive—restore living beauty before the palace falls—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (assembling heirlooms, risking the egg, leaping). Interiority is specific (the silk pouch from his mother, the vial of rain), and the final renunciation of lineage/home lands as a credible cost. Internal contradiction is modest (ache vs. action) rather than deeply conflicted. Still, his turn reads earned and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive—transmuting inherited harm into care—is clear and embodied in concrete choices (rescuing the boy, gifting the coin, releasing the thread-tied sand bird). Her interiority is specific (obsidian flecks, scar-tingle), not generic. The contradiction (need for the coin as compass vs. relinquishing it) is present but could tighten with sharper on‑page hesitation at the handover. Relationship dynamics with the boy are tender and functional, if low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained (to free trapped memories), and her micro-choices—the following of crumbs, the doubt at the shattered jade, the decisive pressing of the shard, and relinquishing the box—cohere. The interior flicker (“perhaps some memories deserved to stay buried”) supplies credible tension. The emotional cost lands in her surrender of the box and tempering of skepticism into belief. The city’s “resistance” is atmospheric more than obstructive, slightly softening pressure on her character.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (break the family’s fire-borne pattern) drives embodied choices: lifting the gear to her sternum, singing, renouncing the heirloom, dispersing herself. Interiority is specific and image-linked (scratches as centuries; dents as rebellion), not generic. The internal contradiction—grief’s pull vs. the vow to “scatter the light without burning”—is active on the page. The final renunciation reads earned, with visible cost (letting the gear rest; choosing disassembly into light).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s vocation and need are specific and embodied—reading the ribbon, questioning the mentor, and chiseling the grooves show motive under pressure. Her interiority is concise but present, with a credible blend of ritual duty and personal ache. Minor softness arises when insight is stated a bit declaratively (“grief is not a monument but a migration”), trimming some ambiguity. Still, her final choices (installing the stone; initiating a new custom) feel earned with a felt cost of time, discipline, and release.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to restore communal balance and earn back trust—drives concrete, ritualized choices (reading each inscription, accepting fractions of guilt, installing the handle). Her interior conflict between resentment and ethical diligence is embodied (“I accept a fraction of this weight,” sting of salt, mayor’s line tightening her throat). Actions align with the persona of a meticulous winder, and the final renunciation—carrying others’ stories inside the pendulum—feels earned. The cost is felt as she absorbs blame piecewise and relinquishes resentment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motives are clear (discover the intentions; tend the dead) and credibly conflicted when the door offers her mother versus duty. Her embodied actions—pressing silk, tracing symbols, setting the coin, then refusing the door—reveal hierarchy of values with felt cost. The chosen renunciation (“Tomorrow”) forecloses an alluring path without tidy consolation. Interiority remains character‑particular, lyric yet grounded in her gardener’s habits.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and specific—she seeks to create responsibly within constraint—and her micro‑choices (touching the spire, choosing equations over “miracle,” drawing the final sigil) align. The hesitation before the last quadrant shows credible internal friction and cost acceptance. The character skews idealized; more contradiction under pressure could deepen texture. Still, actions read as earned and consistent with her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motives are clear and embodied—the copyist’s fidelity to music and hunger to “replant” story drive every micro‑choice. A credible inner tension surfaces around the lyric’s dilemma (“cloak…or let it wander?”) and resolves in a costly commitment to safeguarding. Interiority is specific (ink, brittle paper, dust as medium) rather than abstract. The arc is quiet but earned; a hair more contradiction under peak pressure would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Her motive—crystallizing a fleeting emotion while hiding and confronting truth—drives tactile micro‑choices (pressing ash into cracks, lifting and later removing the mask). Contradictory impulses are live: concealment via the mask versus a need to face grief. Embodied emotion is strong (ash‑stained fingers, porcelain cutting softly, heartbeat compressing dust). The only minor shortfall is a brief abstract turn (“incomplete information cannot birth understanding”) that skews from her otherwise visceral interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation and interior conflict are vivid and particular: he’s a self‑styled rational rebel who must choose between a salable “clean” story and the costly labor of messy truth. Micro‑choices (mapping layers, placing cogs in the skull, offering the seeds) all reveal values under pressure. The contradictory pull between pragmatism and fidelity to evidence is dramatized, not told. The only ding: the final beat cuts off mid‑sentence, slightly blurring the embodied aftershock.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ms. Vale’s interior conflict—her wound from a slur versus her vocation to harmonize—drives concrete choices (naming fears, changing how she sings, ultimately offering the rosette). Emotions are embodied through tactile cues (warmth of wood, breath, “flakes of rust”). The arc from control to listening reads earned and costly. A slight tilt toward abstraction in a few lines keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marisol’s motives and sensory‑driven interiority are vivid and consistent, and her key choices (to prune, to graft, to share rather than eat) align with her values. The chef’s taste‑memory lens individualizes her reactions. Internal contradiction is light; she encounters little genuine resistance, so we see less struggle than the setup promises. Still, her micro‑choices under time pressure feel specific and revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marisol’s motive—tending wonder through a truth-bound routine—is clear and governs her choices (climbing, striking the match, telling the traveler). Interiority is particular (“involuntarily truthful,” the warmth of the coin) but contradictions are mild and the epiphany leans tidy. Costs exist but are gentle (spent matches, surrendering certainty), keeping the arc credible yet not searing. Overall strong, if more luminous than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive (to understand/teach houses how to “breathe”) and consistent micro‑choices through the sanctifying ritual culminate in a credible renunciation (leaving the shard). The shift from noticer to listener lands with a felt cost (giving up role/tool). Internal contradiction is minimal, which keeps pressure gentle rather than crucible‑like. The widow beat adds a relational check but remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurele’s interiority is specific and conflicted: a former embodiment of certainty choosing to become a conduit for nuance. Micro‑choices—“Drink me?”; threading memory through its own fracture; refusing the word miracle—reveal a credible value hierarchy. The cost registers as identity renunciation and vulnerability through the “structural weakness.” A slight tilt toward declarative theme lines trims the upper edge.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear motive (balancing regret; seeking a difference on an identical staircase) drives concrete choices: marking sigils, rolling dice, writing proofs, and offering the chipped die. Contradictory impulses—grim endurance vs. hope—coexist on the page. The endurance at the end (continuing to walk) carries a felt cost of not fully crossing into reunion. Minor dock for a few explicit self‑explanations that lean cerebral over embodied ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive (insomnia + “methodically hopeful” pursuit of the right color/kindness) is clear and drives her actions: she paints, resists sleep, and finally accepts rest after the brush’s sacrifice. Interiority is vivid and particular, though contradictions are gentle rather than pressured. The key choice—stay awake to witness proof—tracks and earns the cost of losing the brush. Secondary figures add pressure and reflection without diluting her lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lysandra’s motive—rescuing dying arts—drives concrete, pressured choices: kneeling to align the lens, then burning catalogued manuscripts to restart a living practice. The curator’s preservationist reflex collides with her willingness to sacrifice artifacts, revealing credible internal contradiction. Embodied emotions (“rosewater dread,” the slab “ice to the touch”) root her shifts in felt experience. The final renunciation—setting the lens into the oven—earns the change from artifact‑saving to culture‑making with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marrow’s motive—rebellion against fate’s metronome—is specific, embodied, and consistent, and his choices (reverse‑engineering, splicing the stone, initiating the grind) align under pressure. The backward tick triggering personal pain (“father un‑striking his face”) gives credible cost. Internal contradiction is subtle (craving drift while crafting with meticulous control) but present. The final asymmetrical smile and renunciation of predictability read earned rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (“to trick fear into revealing its weakness”) drives concrete choices: unbosoming fears, seizing the black mirror exit. Interiority is embodied and particular (teeth falling upward; applause turning to laughter). The advisor applies immediate pressure that exposes contradiction (attraction/repulsion, courage/terror). Final endurance carries cost (repulsive allure clinging), earning the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive and embodied action under pressure; the fear flicker as she steers toward danger humanizes her. Interiority remains mostly via image and action, with limited contradictory impulses beyond courage vs. fear. Backstory (parents, typhoon in B minor) effectively charges her credo without stalling the scene. The final earned stance (tune the obstacle) reads credible, though the personal cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Neris’s motive—an obsessive need to map and decode the city/silence—drives every action and reads consistent. Embodied moments (the porcelain‑cracking rings, lips bleeding on the reed) render emotion without label‑speak. Internal contradiction is limited; she moves with steady resolve more than conflicted tension. Still, her urgency credibly sharpens after the expedition’s warning, earning the final push.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is crisp and coherent, and her “emotionally rational” stance is dramatized through choices (aligning scraps, speaking to an “invisible jury,” etching causal links). Contradictory impulses—trained composure vs. stirred outrage—coexist on the page. The blood at the rosebush lands as a tangible cost. Minor ding: the self-description risks slight didactic over-clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—cataloging absence—is clear and embodied through concrete, profession-coded choices (calipers, measurements, small apologetic script). Her “stoically sensitive” temperament governs action without grandstanding, and the emotional cost surfaces in the vow to remember and the inkwell’s weight. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatic, but the restraint fits the piece’s register. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with a felt burden.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motivation (to trace honest origins) is clear and consistently enacted through tactile micro‑choices: taking the stamp, prying the vault, beginning a new catalogue. Interiority is specific (“logical mind recoiled at contradiction”) and embodied (lantern, heartbeat), though conflict remains predominantly conceptual. Competence slightly outpaces cost; she faces little jeopardy beyond conceptual risk and minor physical strain. Still, her final renunciation of verdicts for hypotheses reads earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive is clear and embodied: a lantern maker seeking to transform grief through a ritual she’s mastered. Interiority is shown via tactile actions (polishing, folding) and specific memories rather than labels. While internal contradiction is subtle, the piece does show endurance through pain (replaying the sister’s death) to earn change. The final acceptance—grief with wings—feels earned by the on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and continuous: she pursues the locus of “unused potential” to repurpose grief, and every action aligns. Interiority is particular and embodied (shrapnel, henna, veil), with credible contradictory currents of pain and “bleak exhilaration.” Micro‑choices under pressure—rerunning models, stepping onto the gantry, releasing the geode, then broadcasting—reveal a hierarchy of values at cost. A subtle renunciation occurs when she lets the larger geode half go, foreclosing one path for an earned stasis/agency shift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s motives and micro-choices are clear and embodied (hovering fingers, aligning the chip, obeying the pulsing trails), with the pilgrim applying soft but pertinent pressure. Her fear (“afraid its memory might burn her”) adds credible hesitation before action. Internal contradiction is modest but present, and the final acceptance of resonance over destination reads earned. The pilgrim is spare but effective, though their own motives remain largely emblematic rather than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt, habits, and self‑erasure are embodied through tactile choices (sifting carvings, fitting the watch hand) and a credible internal contradiction (comforting lies vs. costly truth). The realization that her silence was a choice lands off a concrete cue (the note), not as a generic epiphany. The final renunciation (“I chose silence, and I can choose voice”) feels earned by prior beats and carries cost. A slight neatness in articulating the insight keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s professional poise, calibrated authority (“silence could be a weapon or a cradle”), and precise micro-choices (staring down the guard, structuring the ritual) read specific and earned. The boy and the woman get crisp, individuating lines that reveal values under pressure. The interior contradiction is subtle—Mara’s care vs. ritual detachment—but could bite harder for a higher tier. Still, actions align with motives and the outcome costs her something quiet but real (endurance and time).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The navigator’s goal (find/face the daughter; align heart and action) is clear and intensifies, and his choices under pressure (launching in fog, following the silhouette, leaving the compass) track his contradictions. Embodied emotion runs through tactile anchors (cracked glass, barnacle scrape, bioluminescent wake). The final renunciation reads earned, with the visible cost of surrendering the compass. A hair of safety remains in the near-mythic daughter appearance, but it functions as his internal crucible rather than an easy out.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation and contradiction are vivid: a “clean slate” operator who used the lake as a dumping ground but now follows a phrase he once wrote in a cell. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“air tasted of moss and old apologies”). The sacrifice of the baseball reads as a credible renunciation with cost tied to past identity. Minor glossing (“Empathy had been the first thing I sold…”) is stated but anchored by later choices.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ayla’s motive (reforge a bond at the cost of self) is concrete and sustained, with embodied hesitation (“tremor in her palms,” “metamorphosis began reluctantly”). The mid‑scene ultimatum—“finish the change”—forces a credible renunciation of her human name. Contradictory impulses (grief’s steadiness vs. fear of losing self) coexist on the page. The final endurance reads as earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and pressurized—retrieve “lost time” before the first birthday—embodied through guilt, love, and ritual. Contradictory impulses (repair vs. acceptance) coexist on the page, culminating in “unfasten[ing] the final clasp of her regret.” Micro-choices (aligning the crack, tracing the hand, reaching for the thread) reveal character under pressure. Slight neatness in the final return softens the edge but does not undercut the earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lin’s pacifist ethos motivates every tactic—stitching, naming wounds, sacrificing the relic—with embodied beats (floating as sorrow lightens). The internal conflict is quieter than it could be; she rarely wavers, so ambiguity is limited. Still, the offer of the Tear reads as a credible, costly choice. Echo’s nudges don’t undercut her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s drive—to comprehend how giving alters her—is clear and deepens through embodied choices (uncorking jars, pressing her palm into glass). Contradictory impulses (emptiness vs. ongoing release) operate simultaneously. A credible renunciation occurs: she parts with her last, long‑kept bug and accepts emptiness as echoing space. Slight abstraction surfaces in a few thesis‑like lines, but the interiority remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motive—obedience versus mischief-turned-revolt—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (scratching the sigil, aligning the sundial, socketing the quill holder). Interiority is embodied through tactile focus rather than labels. The internal contradiction is credible but lightly tested; the on-page cost is mostly risk rather than loss. The endurance at the end (remaining sentinel) feels earned as a chosen poise, if not a sacrifice fully paid.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is concrete and sustained by the mother’s promise; the eel herder’s micro‑choices (stone order, switching Fibonacci to golden rectangle, opening the locket, scattering the rocks) reveal priorities under pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile acts with dust and stones. The cost registers as ongoing endurance and self‑renunciation rather than triumph. Internal contradiction (precognition that never grants certainty) usefully complicates action without hand‑waving.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The poet’s drive—to reclaim and understand censored language—feels specific and embodied (“defusing memory,” scars on palms), and her micro‑choices (timing, rarefaction, climbing to project) align cleanly with that motive. Internal contradiction (“furiously tranquil”) gives an undercurrent of tension without melodrama. However, the conflict remains largely one‑sided; doubts or competing impulses don’t materially disrupt her tactics. The endurance/renunciation at the end (emptying the envelope, accepting luminous scars) is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct motives and embodied choices drive both Lysandra and the envoy, with status dynamics legible in their ritualized duel. Interiority is minimal but implied through concrete actions (needle moves, stone steps) and the arm’s “fluid brutality.” The decision to reveal the overture and then to “depart together” reads earned, though the internal cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally. A hair more contradiction or vulnerability on the page would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lark’s desire to forge beauty under pressure and the dread of “molting” create a credible internal contradiction anchored by the “Anchor” wrist inscription. Micro-choices (sharing the tin, reclassifying books, resisting the molt) reveal values and cost. The relationship with Mira functions as crucible, shifting Lark from drift to commitment. Emotion is embodied and particular without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Desire and tactic are crystal: he will defy departure/time through art, with embodied choices (stealing the frame; performing an “unplanned encore”). Interiority is enacted rather than told, with concrete reactions to the clock, compasses, and film. The contradiction—grief’s backward‑looking urge vs. audacious present action—plays on the page. Slight limit: the ethical/moral cost of rewriting their past is touched but not probed deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motive—protecting cultural memory even at the cost of doubting what she loves—drives concrete choices (planting the seed, summoning witnesses, biting the fruit). Interiority is specific to her empirically whimsical gift (tasting tales), not generic sentiment. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. belonging) are dramatized at the end as a lingering, costly stance. Minor limitation: the cost to her skepticism is felt but not deeply dramatized beyond the final note.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Helini’s motive—to reckon with withheld apology and choose a stance toward her apprentice—is embodied in specific, tactile acts (setting the compass on lace, voicing the pattern, finally letting the vessel drift). Contradictory impulses are present: the urge to name/confirm versus the chosen refusal (“she would not confirm the exact color”). The interiority stays character‑particular through bonsai and lace idioms rather than therapy‑speak. The ending renunciation carries cost and reads earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with a specific and consistent interiority rooted in her profession. Her actions—kneeling, using tweezers, running an analysis—are micro-choices that reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The internal conflict between her understanding of catastrophic versus gradual change is earned through observation, making her final shift in perspective feel profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's core conceits. The protagonist's interiority is rendered through the specific, concrete language of her craft ("coax coherence from heat and fracture"), making her perspective unique. The final shift from a presumed goal of vengeance to the earned purpose of remembrance feels profound because it is rooted in her established trait of seeing patterns and finding meaning in pauses, a change earned with the visible cost of accepting the full truth.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rowan’s motivation is crystalline, shifting from a survivor's desperate search for warmth to an artist’s purposeful creation. The interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity—fear as “crimson, curling above the wrist” and awe as “gold at his fingertips.” The arc from questioning ruin to composing within it is earned, culminating in the resonant, wordless gesture of bowing to the tree, a choice that forecloses a return to mere survival and accepts his new role with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his professional duty and a trait of being “inadvertently stubborn.” This trait is demonstrated, not just stated, through his unwavering pursuit of the mission. The internal conflict is sharpest and most effective in the single moment of hesitation before writing his own name, a micro-choice that carries the weight of the entire story's theme and provides a felt cost. The transformation to feeling "lighter" is earned by this act of acceptance and completion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s characterization is exceptional, defined by resolute action rather than exposition. Her motivation is rooted in a clear hierarchy of values where community and future outweigh personal despair. The dialogue with Tomasz provides a perfect crucible, revealing her philosophy not as an abstract ideal but as a hard-won, practical stance against hopelessness.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in the 'spiritually curious' trait. However, the internal conflict feels more described than dramatized; the transition to healing is a beautiful, smooth process rather than a struggle with contradictory impulses. The moment of understanding ("She understood then that...") is an insightful summary, but it slightly bypasses the messier work of earning that epiphany through an on-page choice or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is abstract but powerfully anchored in concrete actions and embodied feelings. Her identity as a maze designer provides a specific and consistent lens for her perceptions. The final transformation is a profound character change, earned through a sequence of choices to press forward, and the cost—her physical existence—is made undeniably clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Motivation is established immediately and sustained under pressure. Interiority is conveyed through potent, specific images ("chains clinking like wind chimes made of regret") rather than abstract labels, and her defining trait of patient strategy is demonstrated, not just stated, in how she decodes the cipher and deploys the arrow. The final choice to plant seeds in the lullaby's pattern shows a change from captive to creator, earning the story's final, fierce smile with a visible cost (the spent arrow).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is established with unique, concrete detail and evolves from a desire for understanding to one of witness. This change is not stated but earned through the climactic, embodied memory of his brother, providing a renunciation of the original goal with a clear, felt cost. The interiority is singular and compelling, driven by the cross-wired perception that is a mechanism, not just a trait.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is poetic yet clear, and her internal conflict between acquisitive artistry and a deeper yearning for truth is well-established. The final transformation is earned within the story's lyrical logic, culminating in a renunciation with a palpable, felt cost. The line "she had already reinterpreted herself into someone who could bear the weight of beauty without stealing it" marks a profound and credible character change.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between her habit of abandonment and desire to build is compelling. The characterization is deeply integrated with her profession as a glassblower, creating a consistent and rich interiority. A minor weakness is the tendency for her internal state or mission to be slightly over-articulated, as in the declaration to the absent engineers, which verges on summarizing the theme rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and compelling, driven by a life-altering revelation. Interiority is mostly strong, though phrases like "vulnerability was power" and "firmly adaptive" feel more like thematic labels than embodied, contradictory impulses in the moment. The twin serves his narrative function, but his immediate alliance on the roof feels convenient, lacking the friction of two people meeting after a lifetime of deception.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oracle's motivation is vast and poetically clear, driving the narrative with singular focus. Her actions are consistent and her interiority is rendered through specific, embodied details like her "mildly obsessed heartbeat." However, the character operates more as a mythic archetype than a complex individual; the attribute "mildly obsessed" is stated but doesn't manifest as a flaw that creates friction or contradictory impulses, limiting the depth of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    J-9's motivation is clear and its internal conflict between programming ("remarkably composed") and emergent guilt is well-dramatized through its changing responses to the violin. The progression from denial to rage to acceptance across the loops earns the final change. The characterization is strong, though the final epiphanies verge on being slightly too articulate, momentarily stepping away from embodied experience into abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and conveyed through resonant action rather than exposition. The motivations—the ex-registrar's need to confess and the registrar's willingness to listen and absolve—are clear and compel the story's single arc. The internal contradiction is subtly shown in the registrar crouching "pretending to collect fallen ticket stubs," masking her true intent. The final change feels earned, a direct result of the choices made in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, conveyed through concrete actions and a distinct interiority rooted in memory. Her motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence is balanced with a quiet, world-weary wisdom. The queen’s transformation from a scoffing rationalist to a humbled believer is earned through the escalating events, making her a strong foil. The contrast between Lira’s tangible, memory-laden marbles and the queen’s abstract luck device creates a powerful crucible for their opposing worldviews.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's core motivation, rooted in grief, is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her internal state is effectively conveyed through her actions and the story's charged atmosphere. The "obliging" trait feels slightly tacked on, as her primary actions are driven by a private, almost defiant, urgency, creating a minor inconsistency that keeps this from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear, specific to her character ("lived in between spaces"), and drives her actions throughout the single scene. The shift from investigator to participant at the climax feels earned. The characterization is strong and internally consistent, with the final choice having a felt, on-page cost as the magical state recedes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The oracle and Elias are rendered with profound emotional precision through subtle gestures and shared silences. Their internal conflicts—guilt, uncertainty, the weight of unsaid truths—are embodied in their interactions with the setting and the central object, culminating in a shared, earned change. The line "He had been alone long enough to feel the weight of every swallowed truth the wind carried" establishes Elias's state perfectly, preparing him for the oracle's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb. The internal conflict between Mara's skepticism and her ritualistic hope (the Saint Jude medal) is established early and paid off perfectly in the final line. Her motivation is specific and compelling, and her emotional arc from seeking knowledge to shouldering a shared weight is earned and embodied in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.5)
    The chronicle keeper is an archetype, but executed with profound depth. His motivation to "witness change without judgment" is not just stated but embodied in every action and perception, culminating in the final act of inscription. The character's internal state is seamlessly integrated with the story's atmosphere, and the felt cost—his own gentle "crumbling in place"—provides a poignant, earned closure that perfectly aligns with his nature.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lila's motivation is powerfully grounded in her relationship with her daughter, making her actions with Rowan feel both professional and deeply personal. The internal state of "cautious exuberance" is specific and sustained, providing a convincing emotional throughline. The change in both characters is earned, particularly Lila's choice to leave the curl, which represents a meaningful shift in how she relates to her own past. The dialogue "Sound can link what words can’t" verges on being too direct a thesis statement, a minor slip in an otherwise nuanced portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc from “curator” to “courier” is well-defined. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-specific details, such as her fear that memory without dreams is merely echo. However, her acceptance of the paradoxical discovery of her own diary is too frictionless; a moment of greater internal contradiction or struggle before the resolution would have elevated the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lin’s motivation to “transpose life into a new key” is established early and provides a strong, coherent drive. The internal contradiction between stale routine and a desire for change is tested immediately and resolved through a decisive, character-affirming choice. Mara's shift is rapid but grounded by the effective line "you hate the tune as much as I do," making the alliance feel earned within the compressed timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The priest's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action, but the characterization remains more conceptual than personal. While his competence is compelling, there is a lack of embodied emotion or internal contradiction that would elevate him from a masterfully executed archetype to a complex individual. His change is shown symbolically (the gray cassock) rather than felt through a shift in interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    The character's motivation—to resolve her "chronological homesickness"—is both unique and deeply felt, driving every action with poetic logic. Interiority is rendered with exceptional, concrete detail (a memory tasting of "metal and pine"). The final change is earned through the painstaking, ritualistic accumulation of memories, making her final step a credible and resonant transformation, not an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to "retrace" is clear and compelling, rooted in a tangible personal history. Her internal conflict is vividly dramatized through her actions and the environment's response. The final choice to surrender the tablet is a powerful, earned change, stemming from the story's central revelation and representing a credible shift from a flawed coping mechanism to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mara’s motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied struggle—the loss of feeling beyond hearing—and her interiority is rendered with stunning particularity ("thunder as color"). Her final change is earned through a costly internal process, not an external victory, making her renewed connection to the children feel profound and authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional. Liora's internal conflict—the meticulous, solitary recorder wrestling with the moral imperative to share knowledge—is dramatized with nuance through her micro-choices. The line "she felt parental toward the breach, protective as if the storm had asked to be seen whole" provides a moment of profound and particular interiority that elevates her motivation beyond a simple whistleblower trope. Her final choice is a perfect synthesis of her contradictory impulses, earned by the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between commodification and remembrance is well-embodied. The transformation from a grieving broker to an atoning planter is earned through the story's central action. However, his final quoted summary ("every scent is a seed, and every tear is rain") feels a little too perfectly articulated, a slight shift from the specific, embodied grief he experiences into a more generic, thematic pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The poet’s motivation is abstract yet grounded in his actions, and his internal conflict is beautifully dramatized in the shift from “ethically playful” to responsible. The final choice to revise the rope’s knots is an earned change, foreclosing his path of detached observation with the felt cost of accepting that his art has consequences in the new world.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The violinist's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply embodied in her unique perceptual abilities. The story earns her transformation from musician to conductor of silence through the costly and resonant renunciation of her instrument ("strings she would never tighten again"). This final choice feels inevitable and emotionally true, fulfilling the demands of characterization at the highest level for this lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with Vale’s internal conflict between professional detachment and encroaching feeling embodied effectively. Her "professionally thorough horror" is a standout moment where her core trait is turned against her. The final transformation is earned, but the concluding epiphany, while powerful, verges on being slightly too diagnostic, abstracting the feeling into a neat summary moments after it has been powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marisol's motivation is clear, and her arc from shrewd composure to emotional vulnerability is well-earned by the climax. The internal conflict between her professional persona and her personal mission is established effectively. However, much of her character development occurs over a summarized period ("Months spiraled into seasons") rather than through a sequence of difficult, in-scene micro-choices under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, potent, and drives every action. The shift from a solitary artist seeking witness to a collaborator is earned through her vulnerability with Fen. The line revealing each reed carries the name of someone vanished is a masterful moment of embodied emotion, grounding her abstract longing in a concrete, painful history. The final choice to co-create feels inevitable and powerful, a perfect fulfillment of her initial drive.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is established with compelling economy and drives every action without deviation. Interiority is rendered through poetic, embodied perception rather than direct statement, fitting the story's lyrical tone. The micro-choice to "whisper an apology to the sleeping titan" perfectly encapsulates her professional drive conflicting with her awareness of the cost, earning the complex final image of her ongoing quest.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and poetic: to learn the “mathematics of emotion” to reverse the “equation” of sorrow. Her internal conflict is beautifully embodied in the shift from seeking a solution to accepting a balance, a change earned through the ritual. The final choice to leave the eyes and walk the corridor of loss is a potent, costly renunciation of her initial goal, demonstrating a profound character arc within a brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear, potent, and drives every action. The story perfectly dramatizes the internal conflict between her long-term, methodical plan for connection and the immediate, impulsive empathy she feels for the teenager. This culminates in a final choice that is both surprising and inevitable, revealing a profound hierarchy of values with a clear, felt cost—the sacrifice of a deeply personal artifact. The final epiphany, "visibility travels in both directions," is fully earned by this on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, with a precisely rendered internal conflict between the need for control and the necessity of surrender. The contradictory impulse—to "run for the potting bench" versus staying in the rain—is dramatized with visceral immediacy. Her professional identity as a nursery owner provides a rich, specific vocabulary for her grief, making her final earned change feel both authentic and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ishka’s motivation—to find coherence in a fractured world—is viscerally embodied in her insomnia, which is brilliantly framed not as emptiness but a "surplus of meaning too sharp to rest against." This interior contradiction fuels the entire narrative, making her final choice to trade a tangible past for an intangible future feel both surprising and inevitable. Her actions are perfectly aligned with this established internal state, and the final renunciation of the brooch is earned with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character arcs are clear and earned, particularly the clairvoyant's shift from absolute certainty to humbled wonder. His need for an anchor is a powerful, embodied moment of his worldview collapsing. The pilgrim's motivation is established early and her final actions fulfill it in an unexpected way, but her interiority remains slightly less textured than the clairvoyant's.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is crystalline and drives every action. Her interiority is specific and filtered through her unique role as an "archivist." The character is compelling and consistent, with her methodical actions revealing a deep internal resolve. A minor weakness is that her single line of dialogue, “Sound returns to the vessel that shaped it,” verges on a direct thematic statement rather than an organic utterance, slightly flattening the character in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her core trait of being an "analytically artistic" mapper is powerfully demonstrated. Her internal conflict is tangible and her final change is earned. The story avoids most therapy-speak, but the on-the-nose realization, "What if the hurt is also the compass?", reads like an overly articulated epiphany, a minor flaw that slightly lessens the embodied struggle in that single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is compelling, with a well-defined internal conflict between skepticism and a deeper curiosity. Her motivation for being at the tower is clear and provides a solid foundation for her arc. The final shift, connecting the cosmic grief to her own, is earned and powerful, though the repeated phrase "courageously kind" verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the emotional complexity in those moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Veyra's motivation—ennui born of immortality seeking the meaning of finality—is established with poetic efficiency and drives the entire plot. The shift from cosmic boredom to renewed purpose is earned by the climactic vision, representing a credible internal change. While the interiority is strong, a few moments rely on familiar phrasing like "a second heartbeat," slightly softening the otherwise particularized voice of an eternal being.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lila’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent and active internal conflict between filial duty and moral reckoning. Her motivation is clear and her actions, particularly the lie to the director, are perfect expressions of her inherited skills and internal state. The contradiction of using her father’s dishonest trade to perform an act of love is beautifully dramatized, and her final stance is earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liang's characterization is exceptional, rooted in the "earnestly studious" trait that is consistently demonstrated, not just labeled. His motivation to collect textures is clear and compelling, driving every action from charting the hum to speaking memories aloud. The internal conflict during his moment of panic is well-realized, as his studious nature reasserts itself to solve the problem, leading to an earned change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation to exist beyond an “administrative typo” is clear and compelling. Interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity, particularly through the sensory filter of the poison label’s scent. The final change—a renunciation of named identity for a new purpose—is earned through the story's accumulative logic, and the cost of this transformation is made beautifully concrete when the death certificate dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with the protagonist's central contradiction—"gloomy cheerfulness"—providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The motivation to test her mother's myth is clear and fraught with personal stakes. The final realization and the earned vulnerability in "I miss you, Mom. I miss believing" demonstrate a profound and credible character change, moving from a binary worldview to a more complex understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, culminating in a believable shift from covert operative to public figurehead. However, her characterization relies on efficient but external labels like "culture shock absorber" and "orderly intuitive" rather than deeply demonstrated interiority. The emotional state of "hopeful desperation" is named rather than fully embodied, making her feel more like a capable archetype than a specific individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation is established through her profession ("catalogued every fracture... as if it were a love letter") and sharpens into a specific, personal quest. The micro-choice to embed the sand grain in the capsule is a powerful, earned action that physicalizes her grief and resolve, linking personal history to the climax with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, potent, and beautifully embodied through her sensory experience. The link between the drone and her daughter provides a powerful emotional core without being overwrought. The character’s competence is skillfully balanced with the constraints of her blindness, allowing her struggle and ingenuity to feel earned. The final choice to return to waiting is a credible expression of her established character, and the cost is felt in the quiet humming of the lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is crystalline and immediately established: find the origin point before she too vanishes. Her defining traits—dry wit, subtle confidence, and precision—are demonstrated through action rather than stated, as when she steps onto the lake with purpose. The characterization is lean but potent, perfectly suited for the story's length and conceptual focus, and her final laugh feels like an earned editorial mark on reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tuner is a compelling archetype whose motivation is flawlessly aligned with his actions. He functions as a mythic catalyst, and in that role, the characterization is near-perfect. The lack of internal conflict or flaw is a fitting stylistic choice for this fable-like piece, but it does prevent the character from reaching the highest tier of complexity where contradictory impulses create pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional. Mara’s motivation is clear and deeply felt, rooted in the concrete object of the perfume vial. The internal conflict between the instinct to preserve a memory and the necessity of releasing it is dramatized with poignant clarity, culminating in an earned and costly choice. Her final decision—to preserve the moment of surrender—shows a profound, earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to "chase the hush" is established immediately and provides a powerful, specific engine for the narrative. Leif’s interiority is rendered with concrete, surprising images rather than labels, particularly the epiphany that "the hush was not silence but every unheard cry his father had swallowed." The final change—from chasing the hush to wearing it—is a profound and earned transformation, demonstrated by the physical object of the ring and his poised readiness for the villagers.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is nuanced and compelling—repaying a debt to the love that made betrayal possible. However, the story resorts to summarizing the pivotal emotional climax ("mournful elation, joy at release tinged with sorrow") rather than embodying it, a diagnostic label that flattens the peak moment of her release.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear, potent, and mythic, driving the entire narrative. Her transformation from a haunted "sleepwalker" to a weaver who dreams with "eyes open" is earned through a consistent ritualistic process. While she functions more as a determined archetype than a psychologically complex individual, this choice perfectly serves the story's fable-like tone and does not detract from the power of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, her interiority is rendered with concrete detail, and her actions align perfectly with her goal. The change she undergoes is earned through on-page struggle. The score is capped below 9.0 because her final realization ("Faith, she realized, was not a monument but a process...") and her closing line to the gravedigger verge on thematic summary, slightly flattening the earned complexity of her internal state into a too-perfect aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a desire for authentic meaning. Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, and her contradictory impulses—the need for secrecy versus the desire to be truly known—are dramatized in the central act. The final choice to mail the letter and embrace her fractured identity is earned by the preceding ritualistic actions, with the cost of vulnerability felt in the description of the letter’s contents.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction between Mira’s foolish exterior and fiercely competent interior is dramatized effectively, particularly in the moment the intruder retreats. Her motivation is clear and her micro-choices, like deliberately pricking her finger to create a cipher, are purposeful and reveal a deep hierarchy of values. The final choice is a direct, earned result of her unique skills and established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is compelling and drives the entire narrative. Her internal conflict between lingering regret and the need for release is beautifully embodied in her actions, particularly the ritualistic use of the shard. The shift from shame to "fierce tenderness" is earned through a series of increasingly vulnerable choices, culminating in a final resolution that feels both decisive and true to the character established.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lin's internal conflict between her professional identity as a detached translator and her personal role as a vulnerable sister is rendered with specificity and embodied emotion ("stomach fold like wet paper"). The contradiction is held in scene, not just summarized, culminating in her choice to perform a personal ritual (giving the coral), an act of translation beyond words. The brief appearance of Dr. Vanna provides the precise external pressure needed to crystallize Lin’s final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora's motivation is established early and sharpens into a compelling internal conflict at the story's midpoint. The hesitation, rooted in her grandmother's story ("brightness like a debt"), provides a moment of genuine, contradictory impulse against the pull of the "knowledge network." This makes her choice to continue feel earned, culminating in a complex emotional state of "sorrow and delight" that avoids a simplistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lila’s characterization is superb, with her central motivation shifting from professional certainty to philosophical curiosity. This transformation is not merely stated but dramatized in her final, costly choice to embed the nickel in the wall. The internal conflict is embodied and her final change feels entirely earned, with the cost made tangible by the "missing tooth" analogy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander is a well-realized archetype, and his motivation is clear and consistent. His actions, like flicking the mimic into a pitcher plant with a wry comment, perfectly embody the "charming rogue." However, his competence is so high that the on-page struggle feels minimal; he dispatches the immediate threat with an ease that slightly lessens the feeling of genuine peril, making the cost of his defiance feel more philosophical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.6)
    The poet’s motivation—to find rest from grief without erasing memory—is profoundly clear and sustained. Interiority is rendered with exceptional, particular detail ("counting spiral steps instead of sheep"), avoiding all cliché. The central conflict between the need for sleep and the self-imposed duty of remembrance is embodied in his every action, and the final shift to a state of earned peace is achieved through a patient, believable magical-realist process, meeting the 9+ test for earned change with visible cost (centuries of sorrow).

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The caretaker’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, driving every action from the discovery of the flaw to its ingenious resolution. Her interiority is rendered through lyrical, embodied perception rather than direct statement. The final beat, where her own name stirs, provides an earned and moving character change, fulfilling the story's arc by turning the act of preservation inward. A deeper in-scene contradiction prior to the ending could have elevated it further, but the quiet endurance is expertly portrayed.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her shift from silence to speech is earned and powerful, culminating in the excellent line, “Fear is just silence with teeth.” Arden’s rapid change of heart is justified within the story's magical framework. The final emotional beat for Lira ("her heart a glass ink well refilled with morning") feels slightly abstract and less embodied than the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional. The arc from a tremble of fear to a tremble of certainty is earned and embodied, grounding her high-stakes decision. Her motivation—a complex blend of professional duty, personal loyalty, and an ethical desire for harmony—is clear and compelling. The final, earned smile lands with significant emotional weight, marking a complete internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora’s character is rendered with exceptional depth through contradictory actions, not exposition. Her shift from meticulously curating lies to the release of burning the papers is earned through the story's pressures. The final interaction with Monsieur Vidal lands with immense power due to the quiet, consistent characterization of both individuals throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Iona's motivation is primal and her interiority is rendered with evocative, specific language. However, the characterization is significantly weakened by her father's dialogue at the resolution. His line, "...sacred thresholds are not crossed; they are earned...," functions as a thematic summary that replaces an authentic emotional exchange, flattening the reunion and making him feel more like an authorial mouthpiece than a father reunited with his child after three years.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation to "learn the rhythm of belonging" is compelling and drives the narrative effectively. Her interiority is rendered in concrete, poetic terms, and the final change feels earned through the climactic vision. However, the character is repeatedly labeled "softly ingenious" rather than demonstrating the trait through a specific, costly choice, which slightly flattens the characterization into a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her character is revealed effectively through her actions and interactions with the magical setting. The final shift from a seeker of paths to a carrier of their essence is a well-earned change. Her interiority is beautifully embodied in the physical sensations from the crater glass, preventing abstract emotional summary until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Finch is an exceptionally well-realized character for this length. His motivation—to order randomness into wonder—is established immediately and consistently demonstrated through his actions, from the tide-table melody to the pre-timed gull. The characterization achieves a difficult balance, portraying him as a master of his craft without making him feel omnipotent; his bow "to the pattern" shows a humility that grounds him. His internal state is revealed through precise action rather than exposition, making him both mysterious and understandable.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lysandra's motivation is potent and consistently expressed through embodied action rather than summary. Her interiority, rich with metaphors of tides and roots, feels specific to her identity as a "tide dancer." The transformation is earned by the preceding micro-choices—reading the soil, pressing the stone—making her final acceptance of her new role as a living scroll feel like an inevitable, costly culmination of her rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from treasuring flawed glass to her final choice. Her interiority is concrete, particularly in the tide pool communion. The characterization is held back from the highest tier only by a lack of sharp internal contradiction; her path to the final choice feels more like a serene, linear progression of understanding rather than a struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Mara's motivation and internal state rendered in concrete, visceral terms. Her transformation is earned through a costly internal action. A minor deduction is for the line "Pain, she realized, was not a wound but a prism," which verges on unearned, diagnostic epiphany, though the story immediately dramatizes the concept, largely mitigating the flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation as a "logical dreamer" is clear and her actions are consistent. However, the story's climax relies on an over-articulated epiphany that functions more like a thematic summary than earned interiority. The line "She understood now that to puzzle out new equations for hope was not to solve but to share..." is diagnostic label-speak that states the theme directly, weakening what was already powerfully implied by the story's imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her arc toward accepting her legacy is earned and compelling. The final choice lands with a legible cost, demonstrating a meaningful change. The characterization is slightly weakened by the repetitive use of the label “sensitively perceptive” rather than consistently embodying the trait through unique action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply integrated with her core vulnerability—the locket. Her interiority is conveyed through potent, specific imagery ("a melody threaded with half-remembered promises") rather than abstract labels. The final change, the integration of the heartbeat, is an earned transformation resulting directly from her on-page actions, representing a profound shift in her being with a palpable, albeit subtle, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Aurelia’s motivation for redemption is made concrete through her past as a “forever war peace negotiator,” and her core trait of being “operatively gentle” creates a potent internal conflict with the silent, passive ritual she must now perform. The arrival of Kelis provides a crucible that tests her resolve, and her final shift from scripting grand treaties to accepting a quiet, shared future is an earned and resonant change. Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, grounding abstract guilt in tangible memory and action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira’s central contradiction is the story’s engine, dramatized perfectly through her choices. The internal conflict between the calculating “philanthropist” and the “sentimentalist” is externalized in a single, powerful scene. The final transformation to a state of “fractured grace” is earned by the preceding struggle, landing with a visible, world-altering cost that feels both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lys’s motivation is powerfully established through the potent concept of her chastity as a “blade.” The transformation from a “practiced smile” to a “raw, unguarded curve” provides a satisfying, earned character change. While her internal conflict is more reflective than dramatized in-scene, her interiority is concrete and specific, particularly the moment her fingers tremble “not from cold but from reverence,” which perfectly embodies her state. The characterization is exceptional, with a clear hierarchy of values revealed through her final, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lucien’s characterization is superb; his motivation to "reverse the damage words had done" is not just stated but embodied in every action. His contradictory nature—an urbane artist in a seedy dome, a former propagandist seeking atonement—is compelling. The supporting cast, though briefly sketched, reacts with believable skepticism that turns to engagement, their transformations feeling earned rather than automatic. The confession of complicity provides a crucial layer of flawed humanity, preventing him from becoming a mere savant.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.8)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to “honor overlooked histories” is not just stated but embodied in every meticulous action. The internal conflict—her profound need to commemorate versus her “embarrassment” at that need—adds a layer of vulnerable humanity that makes her esoteric focus feel grounded and deeply relatable. Her final acceptance of the grotto's forgetting is an earned, quiet change with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The caster’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, rooted in a specific, haunting guilt. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular metaphors, such as the memory of names ringing "like a cracked street organ punched card scrap." The final change to a state of earned forgiveness is compelling because it's achieved through a difficult, physical act of atonement, making the emotional arc feel embodied and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization of a non-human, algorithmic consciousness is achieved with exceptional consistency. The motivation is tied directly to its origin story, providing clear stakes. The shift from a "precisely playful" internal state to one fractured by revelation is dramatized effectively, and the final choice is a direct, earned consequence of this shift, paid for with the legible cost of identity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.4)
    Naram-Sin's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent: a frugal man of science seeking certainty in a mystical world. The internal conflict between his mistrust of gifts and his reliance on the magical tile is perfectly pitched. The final choice, where his frugality informs his weighing of personal glory against cosmic order, is a masterful and earned culmination of his established character.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by the potent internal contradiction of the “scheming pacifist.” Her motivation evolves organically from a desire for external silence to the more profound understanding that she must first heal her own resentment. The moment she presses the pin to her sternum, linking its memory to her heartbeat, is a superb example of embodied emotion. The final transformation from schemer to a luminous, listening figure is earned with the cost of her entire life, fulfilling the 9+ test for an earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's transformation from a rigid craftsperson to an open creator is compelling and earned. Her motivation is clear and evolves satisfyingly from control to understanding. The only minor weakness is the line "a crack she hadn't noticed growing across her own heart," which verges on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly flattening the subtext of a beautifully rendered internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mender’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, driven by a compelling blend of professional duty and personal grief. Her interiority is strong, especially the moment her "heart buckled" at the sight of her mother's face. However, the epiphany "generational wisdom is not a bridge but a graft" feels slightly too articulate and diagnostic for an in-the-moment realization, bordering on thematic summary rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is established immediately and provides a clear drive. Her character arc is one of conceptual transformation rather than emotional reversal; she moves from 'bewildered' to 'simply complicated,' a shift earned through a series of surreal trials. The internal conflict is externalized effectively through the mirror scene, where her future self provides a cryptic warning, creating a choice that is both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc from knowledge-preserver to wisdom-gardener is compelling and earned. Her final choice to stay is a powerful renunciation with a clear, felt cost. However, her interiority feels more intellectual than embodied; her emotional state, particularly when witnessing her past failures, is reported rather than viscerally experienced, which keeps the character at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—grief as a compulsive, exploratory force—is rendered with exceptional clarity and specificity. The internal conflict is not summarized but dramatized through concrete actions, like touching the fractured mirror or pulling narrative threads. The final choice between “Stay” and “Go” is a perfectly earned culmination of the character’s contradictory impulses, foreclosing a path with the tangible cost of the sinking ship.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" is exceptionally clear and drives every action. However, her characterization as "adaptable" is not tested on the page, and her execution is so flawless that she lacks compelling internal conflict or struggle. Her competence is well-established, but the absence of a genuine moment of doubt or a difficult trade-off keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mapkeeper’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to hoard silence is clear, specific, and embodied in her skin-maps. The internal conflict is dramatized beautifully in the simple, powerful gesture of closing her fist on the stone and then opening it, a choice that carries the weight of her entire worldview. The line "the lesson hurt" provides the necessary cost and texture to her epiphany, preventing it from feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions are well-aligned with her core belief system. The characterization is strong, showing her gift as a genuine burden with embodied consequences ("colors too bright to bear"). However, the story lacks a moment of significant internal contradiction in-scene; her faith in coincidence, while tested, is never truly shown to waver, making her a slightly archetypal figure of unwavering purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira’s motivation to “sculpt identity” is established immediately and her internal conflict—the fear that choosing betrays the whole—is potent and drives the plot. Her arc from an active “sculptor” to a receptive “listener” is earned through the discovery of the obelisk. The change is profound, felt, and demonstrated by her final actions, fulfilling the 9+ test of a costly, earned renunciation of her initial goal.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora is a compelling archetype whose motivation is crystal clear and whose actions are consistent. The concept of "serious playfulness" is well-embodied in her gait and actions. However, she functions more as a mythic vessel for the theme than a character with deep internal contradictions or flaws; her competence is absolute, and the struggle is purely external, which limits the score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elian's internal conflict between his "chronicler's habit" and his desire for "texture" is specific and compelling, driving his actions. Mara's arrival, motivated by a raw fear of silence, provides immediate, authentic pressure. The final change, a shift from isolation to shared understanding, is earned through the crucible of the shared vision, demonstrating a clear and poignant arc for their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional; Lira's interiority is rendered with concrete, synesthetic detail, making her motivation to escape claustrophobia visceral. The father's transformation is earned and powerfully condensed into the line "Teach me," which lands with significant weight. The change in both characters is credible and rooted in the story's central pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's motivation is established with poetic clarity and dramatized consistently through her gentle, deliberate actions. While her internal conflict is minimal, her resolve and competence create a strong character anchor. The child is less a character than a catalyst for the theme, but her progression from silent grief to a quiet smile is earned and emotionally credible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is effective and archetypal, fitting the story's mythic tone. Motivation is clear and the shift from seeker to keeper is earned through the trial of the staircase. The protagonist's defining trait, "wisely adventurous," is demonstrated through action, but her interiority, while consistent, lacks the contradictory impulses or specific flaws that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal process drives the entire narrative. The interiority is specific, linking physical scars to emotional history. However, it occasionally veers into overly articulate self-diagnosis ("absence could be as instructive as presence"), which slightly lessens the feeling of being in a raw, unfolding emotional crisis and reads more like a summary of a concluded one.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly the internal conflict in the climax. The tension between the "virtuously mischievous" part of Mara that wants to profit and the part that seeks reconciliation is dramatized with precision and cost. Her motivations are clear, and her final renunciation of her "sales pitch" feels earned and definitive, foreclosing her old path.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, and her internal conflict upon learning the truth—choosing to continue listening rather than destroying the source—is a potent micro-choice. The shift from "ender" to "beginning" is an earned reversal, grounded in the story’s central revelation. Her contradictory impulses are dramatized effectively, making her final stance feel both surprising and inevitable, with the cost being the negation of her life's original purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.5)
    Calen’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction: the withdrawn knight drawn to a "forbidden and necessary" act with "shivering bliss." His motivation is clarified efficiently with the memory of the "child queen," giving his abstract quest a concrete emotional anchor. The final change, becoming "both marionette and master," is a perfectly earned resolution to his initial state of guilty passivity, satisfying the core arc with profound and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist's characterization is compelling and deeply integrated with the story's core conceit. Her motivation is clear and her internal conflict—between being a custodian of sorrow and an architect of hope—is beautifully rendered through her actions. The final micro-choices to reframe the narrative for the support group and forgive her father feel earned by the discoveries in the scene, representing a credible and moving character change.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, conveyed through potent micro-choices rather than exposition. The decision to not call out to the boy is a masterstroke; it demonstrates Lira’s banked fire, her pragmatism, and the cost of survival in this world. This single moment shows a profound internal conflict between the desire for solidarity and the necessity of caution, elevating her beyond a simple rebel archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is established immediately and tested through a potent internal conflict between creation (addition) and prevention (subtraction). The final choice to renounce his music's typical function is a powerful act of agency, earned through prior reflection and culminating in a felt, permanent cost—carrying the folded silence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and evolves beautifully from seeking order to embracing a cosmic cycle. His interiority is conveyed through strong, embodied language like "mossy delight curling around his ribs." The only minor weakness is the swiftness with which his fear of guardianship is resolved in a single sentence, slightly flattening a moment of potential internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between mending certainty and embracing fracture is well-established. The decisive micro-choice to "befriend uncertainty" is a strong pivot that makes his descent into the cavern feel earned rather than passive. The final change to a new philosophical state is credible within the story's logic, showing a fully realized arc at this compact length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict—recasting a soul versus honoring its cracks—is embodied in the central action. The final shift from guilt as a burden to regret as ballast is earned and resonant. The characterization is strong, though a line like "Transformation, she realized, was not a single transmutation but a negotiation with limits" verges on diagnostic self-awareness that slightly lessens the immediacy of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, conveyed through action and specific detail rather than exposition. The collector's internal state is beautifully embodied by the weight of her coat and the final loosening in her chest. Her final, earned choice to speak after a century of silence demonstrates a profound change, foreclosing her old path with the cost of her former identity. The musician is an effective foil, her motivation clear and her role essential to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    The characterization is exceptional, with interiority rendered through a highly specific and embodied lens. Kael’s contradictory impulses—the mind wanting to move while the body locks into a conditioned brace—are dramatized effectively. The final change from seeking escape to seeking integration is earned through a series of concrete micro-choices, culminating in a credible, costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her final choice—giving the specific memory of her grandmother’s trembling hands—demonstrates an earned change in understanding with a palpable cost. The interiority is concrete and specific to her role. While the sister's dialogue verges on thematic summary, the protagonist's own actions, particularly the final transaction, ground her character arc in a compelling, non-abstract choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is strong and consistent. Her motivation, stemming from a "weightless burden" and her grandfather's legacy, is clear and compelling. The blend of her practical profession (elevator technician) and supernatural ability is well-realized, particularly in how her observational skills transfer to the paranormal investigation. The final transformation is earned by the preceding events, with the cost of leaving her old life behind made explicit and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The operator's motivation—boredom with perfection and a desire "to compress eternity into a moment"—is established early and provides a powerful engine for her actions. Her internal state is rendered through potent, specific choices, such as selecting the "Farewell" whisper to begin the deconstruction. The character earns her final transformation by actively pursuing the rupture, with the story showing a compelling shift when she realizes the moment she seeks is not the compression but "the beautiful violence of a system destabilizing."

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with her internal conflict between her failed revolutionary past and her current role as poet-caretaker made tangible through action. The contradiction is powerfully embodied in the scene where she is found covering a mirror that reflects her younger, more certain self. Her transformation from seeing herself as a "revolutionary or traitor" to a "bridge" is earned through her choices, and her motivation feels both profound and deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Emil’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict—a flicker of doubt—is masterfully externalized, causing the philosopher's chip to gutter. This direct link between interiority and the magical system is a significant strength. The characterization of Midnight as a frightened child adds welcome complexity, though the explicit summary of Emil's motivation ("Emil’s motivation was simple and vast...") feels slightly less elegant than the rest of the story's "show, don't tell" approach.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and powers the entire narrative arc from her initial collection of petrichor to her final renunciation at the membrane. The final choice is a powerful culmination of her "sensibly eccentric" nature, showing an internal conflict between knowing and wondering that is resolved with a tangible, on-page cost. Interiority is rendered with specific, evocative language that avoids cliché, earning the character's final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority sometimes resolves into thematic summary rather than embodied conflict. Her quick acceptance of the fantastical premise is plausible within the story's reverie-like tone, though a moment of sharper internal resistance could have deepened the characterization. The change she undergoes from lost survivor to knowing steward is earned by the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation—the childhood question about night-blooming flowers—is established immediately and provides a powerful, consistent engine for the entire narrative. Her interiority is rendered through concrete action and perception, avoiding abstraction. The character arc is subtle but clear and earned: the shift from a "need to understand" to a "desire to witness" marks a profound change in her relationship to the mystery, her mother, and her art, representing a well-executed form of closure with a felt cost of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation as an archivist seeking to bear witness is perfectly clear and consistent. Her internal conflict—the poet’s fear versus her own resolve—is embodied and not merely stated, culminating in an earned choice to accept the burden of responsibility. The final transformation of the retrocognitive hold into a duty feels like a genuine, costly change, fulfilling her arc with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The alchemist's motivation and internal arc are exceptionally clear and well-earned. The shift from clinging to a false hope (the bottle) to embracing creative work is potent. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through his rejection of weeping and his active process of conceiving a new world, culminating in the "small, fierce smile of a builder." His defining trait—rejecting false comfort—is not just stated but demonstrated, making his final choice feel both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.7)
    Elowen’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to archive the past creates a compelling internal conflict with the needs of the present, and her core flaw—listening only to antique tongues—is diagnosed and resolved with convincing causality. The final, earned renunciation of her passive role for an active one demonstrates a perfectly executed arc with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, specific, and embodied. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, contradictory feelings, as when she lets the storm's fury and the atrium's serenity "braid inside her chest." The final choice to withdraw and seal the vortex is a credible renunciation with a felt cost. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness ("For an instant she understood that inheritance is not property but permission..."), which momentarily lessens the scene's emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation—"to favor listening over noise"—is established early and provides a powerful, consistent lens for his actions. The shift from a "credibly curious" outsider to an initiate who accepts the weight of responsibility is earned through the climax. The character’s internal world is rendered with concrete, professional details that make his quiet epiphany feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    The character is a compelling archetype whose motivation is clear and whose arc toward embracing vulnerability is earned. The final change is profound and well-supported by his preceding actions. However, the interiority lacks genuine contradictory impulses, presenting more of a linear process of acceptance, and the final realizations are articulated in language that borders on thematic summary rather than purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    The recluse's motivation is exceptionally clear and his arc from scribe-in-exile to keeper-of-silences is earned and satisfying. His final choice to add his own strip and remain has a palpable cost, solidifying his transformation. While direct internal conflict is minimal, his focused actions and perceptive shifts effectively convey a deep internal journey, making his final state of "tranquilly perceptive" feel like a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a vivid and specific interiority rooted in the story's core conceit. The protagonist's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her goal.

    The poet's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to "tend that knowledge gently" is established early and provides a clear, resonant drive. Interiority is rendered through concrete, character-particular metaphors ("the air itself were a fragile manuscript"), and her final shift from seeing the snap as loss to release is earned through a sequence of embodied actions and reflections. The internal conflict between the child's belief in triumph and the adult's understanding of surrender is beautifully dramatized without resorting to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is crystalline and her actions align perfectly with it, creating a powerful sense of purpose. The “brazen calm” is a compelling trait, embodied consistently from the inciting incident to her final breath. The characterization is very strong, though it lacks a moment of significant internal contradiction; her resolve is so complete that it borders on archetypal rather than purely human, which slightly flattens the potential for a deeper internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, and her arc from skeptic to believer is legible. The central conflict is her internal struggle, culminating in the line "here was a miracle dismantling her instead." However, the characterization is weakened by the final beats, where her epiphany is articulated with the over-explicit, diagnostic language of a thesis statement ("The chemistry of homecoming, she realized, was catalyzed by contradiction..."), which lessens the emotional impact of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman is a compelling, if archetypal, character whose motivation is crystal clear and rooted in grief. His transformation is earned and signified by the on-page smile, a powerful moment of release. While the characterization serves the fable-like tone perfectly, it prizes mythic resonance over the granular, contradictory impulses one might find in a more psychologically realist mode.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, especially for a non-human POV. The bloodhound's motivation to resolve the wasteland's distance into closeness is a powerful, embodied goal. His final shift in understanding is earned through the story's central sensory experience, representing a credible change. A minor deduction is for moments where the narration labels the dog's state (e.g., "He becomes intuitively descriptive") rather than purely inhabiting his perception, a brief slip in an otherwise masterfully sustained interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves credibly from compassionate mourning to active exploration and rescue. The internal conflict between duty to memory and duty to the living is dramatized through the choice to engage with the anomaly. The final shift from "blessed pariah" to "simply navigator" is earned and provides a powerful, concise resolution to the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his central choice—giving up his birth-name—carries a specific, felt cost. However, the epiphany is weakened by a line of diagnostic self-awareness ("Kael understood: to amend the wrongness above, he must first amend the fear inside"), which tells the theme rather than allowing the character's actions to embody it fully. This explicit summary at a pivotal moment holds the characterization back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and well-executed. The transition from a reactive "crisis actor" to a proactive "historian of small gestures" is earned through a series of concrete, symbolic actions. Her interiority is revealed through embodied choices—tracing the board, walking the patterns—rather than abstract summary, perfectly aligning her internal conflict with her on-page performance. The final renunciation of her old roles feels definitive and costly, a beautifully rendered character arc in miniature.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The seer’s core internal conflict—the pain of remembering versus the need to reclaim her heritage—is the story's engine. Her motivation evolves believably from a desire to forget into a need to understand, and this shift is earned through her interaction with the stone and the mountain. The final choice to speak is a powerful, earned resolution, with the cost embodied in her "mercury tears."

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlen’s motivation to assuage his guilt is powerfully established and sustained. His interiority is specific, filtered through the lens of chess, avoiding stock emotions. The internal conflict between his compulsive need for control (drumming openings) and his desire for release is embodied, culminating in the beautifully earned moment where he stills his hands and accepts the "draw," a renunciation of his former self with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysandra's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her defiant artist persona. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly the weight of her purpose. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of overly articulate self-awareness, where internal thought reads more like a thematic summary than an in-the-moment feeling, such as "She understood now the price of forgiveness...".

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator's motivation is primal and clear: hold oblivion at bay. The transition from "uncertain alchemist" to "keeper" is earned through the story's central ritual, with the final acceptance of the burden marking a clear, costly change. Interiority is concise but effective, particularly the physical act of submersion to "scour doubt," which beautifully embodies the internal struggle. The 9+ quick test for contradictory impulses acting in scene is met by the simultaneous creation and acceptance of a dire, unending duty.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.6)
    The painter’s motivation is seamlessly integrated with his actions, from the initial quest to the final renunciation. The interiority is superb, particularly the phrase "intimately aloof," which is not just stated but demonstrated in his detached observation of his own profound experience. The final choice feels both surprising and inevitable, an earned change that resolves the central contradiction between holding on and letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with excellent, concrete detail. The central contradiction between her grandmother’s “gentle teachings” and her own suppressed need to be heard is powerfully dramatized in the climax. Her final choice—the scream of “tenderness so fierce”—is earned by the preceding pressure and feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, driven by a motivation that is both abstractly named ("the geography of loss") and viscerally embodied ("the ache under her ribs"). The protagonist's contradictory impulses—a desire to ignore the command versus the compulsion to follow it—are established early and resolved through action. The final choice to cross the bridge is a perfectly earned culmination of her grief-driven ritual, with the physical cost of her cut and burned hands making her internal transformation tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, established with a voice that is both skeptical and lyrical. The internal conflict between her rational temperament and the magical reality she confronts is dramatized effectively, particularly when her involuntary truthfulness turns her into a direct threat. The final shift from forager to guardian is a profound change earned through the story’s central trial, foreclosing her old life with the felt cost of a new, binding responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper's motivation is clear and his internal journey from observer to guardian is compelling and earned. His emotions are well-embodied, particularly the shock of the received memory ("vivid as a wound"). However, the interiority occasionally slips into summary, stating his realization directly ("the keeper understands now she came to transfer the forgetting") rather than letting the insight remain fully embodied within the preceding images.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias’s motivation, rooted in a promise to his late sister, is clear and poignant, driving every action. His specific trait of being “empirically intuitive” is not just a label but a functional part of the plot, and his final, earned renunciation provides a powerful and resonant character arc, moving from a desire to rewrite the past to a mature acceptance that honors another's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear internal conflict dramatized through the encounter with the younger self. The queen’s change from disenchantment to acceptance is earned and carries a felt cost (giving up ambition for reconciliation). The score is tempered by moments of summarized insight, like "Understanding pierced her," which tell rather than show the final turn in her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is potent and concise, with motivation rooted in a shared professional and philosophical history. The shift from a flawed goal (bottling time) to a new understanding is dramatized through decisive, costly actions—not just stated. The relationship serves as an effective crucible, and the final exchange of the columella curl provides a subtle, powerful reconfiguration of their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict is rendered with startling clarity and specificity, particularly the jealousy felt toward her past and future selves ("You wasted the wings," "You never learned to fall"). The protagonist's contradictory impulses are not merely stated but dramatized in scene, earning the final transformation from a controller of narratives to an acceptor of chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular detail rooted in her sensory loss. Her internal conflict—grieving a lost sense while tentatively exploring others—is embodied in her actions, like turning the screw or feeling the glass. Milo functions perfectly as a catalyst, his quiet presence applying gentle pressure that forces Elara’s micro-choices. The final change is deeply earned, a convincing evolution from grief to a new mode of perception.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is vast but specified by her embodied struggle—the crystalline scars that physically manifest from past trauma. Her internal conflict between shame and the will to transform is dramatized effectively through the ritual's physical toll. The final change feels earned, as it is the direct result of confronting specific, painful memories on the page, making the arc both concrete and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The exorcist's motivation is potent and clear, rooted in a past professional failure. Her interiority is revealed through specific, sensory details—a voice “roughened by sleepless nights and ether”—and her defining trait of using metaphors is expertly dramatized in the climax. The final moment, tasting “bergamot and closure,” provides a satisfying, embodied resolution. The character reads as a competent, weary professional haunted by the consequences of her own imperfect work.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist serves as an effective archetypal vessel for the story's concept, with a clear and consistent motivation to "unravel cosmic illusions." However, her characterization lacks the granular interiority and contradictory impulses expected at the highest level. Insights like "She understood then" are asserted rather than earned through embodied struggle, making her feel more like a function of the cosmic process than a person within it.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shepherd’s motivation is intensely focused and his interiority is specific and compelling. The contradiction between his precise, technical methods and his abstract, philosophical goal is well-drawn. However, the final epiphanies ("what clocks truly measure is the distance between events and the ache..." and "...the longing for time to be measurable") verge on over-articulated diagnostic labels, slightly undermining the earned, embodied nature of his realization by summarizing it too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong but relies on a somewhat late introduction of the core emotional wound (the lattice vision) to power the climax. The protagonist's internal conflict between defense ("equations") and surrender is made tangible. The "familiar stranger" works well as a thematic catalyst, though he functions more as an archetypal guide than a fully-realized character, which is appropriate for this story's length and mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb, with a deeply felt internal conflict between the rational professor and the grieving daughter. The contradiction is not just stated but dramatized in her micro-choices, culminating in the decision to go to the roof. The final change is earned and made concrete through her resolution to draft a new lecture, satisfying the 9+ test for causality and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.8)
    Mara's motivation evolves organically from a static philosophy ("cultivated estrangement") to a dynamic goal ("to teach endings how to begin"), earned through the scene with Lila. Her final self-sacrificial choice feels like the inevitable, potent conclusion to this internal arc, with the cost of her physical form made explicit and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority rendered in precise, specific language. The archivist’s internal conflict between methodical duty and overwhelming grief is beautifully embodied, particularly in the micro-choice to record proximate causes before metaphysics. The final transformation is earned through a series of small, determined actions, making her acceptance of the covenant's cost feel inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, established with sharp economy in the opening lines. Her motivation—a deep loneliness stemming from a life of impersonal giving—is clear, poignant, and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between her professional cynicism (“like asking a tornado to alphabetize my regrets”) and her desperate hope is beautifully dramatized, making her choice to trust the improbable feel earned. The final shift in her emotional state is subtle but profound, a perfect culmination of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's core conceit. Her motivation is singular and clear, and her interiority is rendered with stunning, concrete detail ("atlas inside her skull"). The final change is earned through a journey that externalizes an internal struggle, and the realization that "she had been mapping herself all along" provides a powerful, resonant closure to her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s internal conflict—her confident uncertainty, her weighing of mercy against cruelty—is not just stated but demonstrated through her choices and their consequences. The character arc from a "thresher" of meaning to a "gardener" who learns weeds have names is earned and resonant, culminating in a powerful change of perspective that feels both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation to "translate silence into music" is established early and consistently drives his actions. The internal conflict between past loss and present creation is embodied in specific, non-clichéd moments, such as the "soundless laugh that shook his shoulders like a tambourine" and the feeling of "cold, joyful sorrow." The final actions feel earned, stemming from a character whose core contradiction—a composer who cannot hear—is explored with nuance and artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation—atonement for a promise broken by fire—is viscerally established and consistently drives the narrative. Her internal conflict is powerfully embodied through actions like painting with "ink distilled from her own burnt tears." The final transformation into the archive's new heartbeat is a profound, earned change that provides a costly but resonant closure, moving beyond simple redemption into a form of sacred duty.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and her internal conflict between empathy for the memory donors and the need for her own autonomy is beautifully dramatized, not just stated. The final choice to release the memories is a powerful and earned culmination of her "quietly rebellious" nature, with the cost of returning to the ward underscoring her commitment to selfhood. Her contradictory impulses—honoring others while saving herself—act simultaneously in the climax, making it resonant and complex.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is established with poetic clarity, and her actions are consistent with her goal. However, the motivation—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—reads more as a beautiful thesis for the story than a deeply embodied, personal need born from specific conflict. Her interiority is more observational than conflicted, which slightly lessens the impact of her final choice, making it feel more thematic than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guardian's characterization as an archetypal, silent figure is perfectly calibrated for the story's mythic tone. Motivation is established with poetic efficiency ("silence can be a vow") and remains the unwavering driver of all actions. Interiority is conveyed entirely through precise, embodied action and perception, which is a sophisticated choice that enhances the sense of ritual and purpose. The character is a functionary of a cosmic process, and the story wisely avoids psychological depth that would clash with its allegorical nature, earning its high score through consistency and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She functions more as a flawless vessel for the story's theme than a complex individual. The absence of any significant internal conflict, self-doubt, or embodied struggle makes her journey and ultimate success feel frictionless and preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between forced politeness and innate wildness is compelling. However, the story resorts to diagnostic language with the line "urging her to find freedom in embracing one's true nature," which summarizes her inner drive rather than embodying it. While her final choice is a powerful culmination, this moment of telling, rather than showing, slightly undermines the earned quality of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The farmer’s progression from stoic observation to emotional acceptance is earned and compelling, particularly his hesitant gestures toward the bouquet. The performer is a well-realized archetype, though his motivation is stated a bit too directly (“To cultivate lightness in grief”). The authorial label “morally ambiguous in the way only a grieving parent can be” feels like an intrusion that slightly undermines the otherwise strong, embodied characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative arc. Interiority is rendered in a poetic style that matches the story's overall voice. The character's transformation is earned through on-page action. A minor deduction is for the phrase "aesthetically driven," which feels slightly too diagnostic and intellectualized for a moment of intense emotional release, slightly flattening the character's embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira’s motivation to find beauty in imperfection is clear and consistently drives the narrative. Her internal conflict during the bargain is concise but potent, showing contradictory impulses in action ("She hesitated...yet the reed tongue sang a silver promise"). The final shift from searching for color to cherishing flaws is an earned change, directly resulting from the story's central ordeal, meeting the 9+ test for causality and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, her interiority is concrete, and her transformation from pilgrim to sanctuary is earned with a felt cost. The internal conflict between her heavy silence and "powerfully gentle" nature is resolved beautifully through action. The characterization is nearly flawless, with a slight tendency for epiphanies to be articulated with a clarity that borders on thematic statement rather than raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and her transformation is powerful. However, her interiority, while poetic, sometimes aestheticizes grief rather than embodying its contradictory, messy reality. The final epiphanies are articulated with a neatness that feels more like a thematic summary than a raw, character-bound realization, slightly lessening the earned feel of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is conveyed with superb economy through her ritualistic actions, which serve as a perfect externalization of her internal state. Her motivation—a "steadily curious hunger" to understand—is consistent and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The final choice to descend and trade in stories feels earned by the preceding intellectual and spiritual labor, representing a credible change in her role within the new world.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The historian's motivation is potent and clear, rooted in a specific, terrible past event. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, contradictory emotion ("anguished joy"). The final shift from seeking to purify by cleansing to purifying by accepting raw truth is an earned, meaningful change, directly resulting from confronting the memory core. The backstory of the burning fields is well-integrated, providing emotional weight without stalling the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation to "preserve the shape of hope" is clear and powerfully tested when she must choose between her duty to record and her impulse to intervene. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her actions. The choice to act is earned by the escalating threat, and her final emotional state of "luminous regret" provides a complex, character-rich resolution that avoids simple triumph. Her competence as a "sharp-eyed" observer is perfectly balanced with the genuine struggle of her unprecedented choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, moving from gentle victim to fierce agent. The internal conflict between her inherent kindness and a necessary, burgeoning anger is dramatized through her actions, not just stated. The choice to reconstruct the tail serves as a powerful objective correlative for her psychological journey. The final image of her "small and fierce" smile is earned, representing a credible and costly evolution from "fragile convictions" to "tensile" strength.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional; the core motive, "a closure seeker who opens wounds," is established immediately and then dramatized with profound literalism in the climax. The protagonist's internal state is rendered with concrete, particular interiority ("veins like green static"), and her final choice is a perfectly earned and costly embodiment of her defining contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is established immediately and her internal state is rendered with specificity and contradiction—she has forbidden herself to speak a name, yet her entire errand is to confront the love associated with it. Her change from stasis to forward motion is earned through the psychometric process, a credible progression for this character. The final choice to leave the quartz but carry the tune is a powerful, embodied resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her personal history with the sextant and her grandmother. Her internal conflict is powerfully embodied through memories of abandoned art, and the final choice to turn the instrument on herself is a masterful, earned pivot. The contradiction between her desire for expression and the "iron taste of silence" is palpable throughout, culminating in a credible and moving transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guard's motivation is archetypal yet potent, crystallizing from a received order ("escort") to a chosen purpose ("cultivate"). The critical choice to sacrifice the archive is perfectly foreshadowed by the librarian's instruction, making the climax feel inevitable and earned. The character's dreamless state provides a powerful internal logic for his actions; he has nothing personal to lose and everything conceptual to gain.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is the story's unambiguous engine, driving every action from the first beat to the last. The internal transformation is profound, and the high cost—the complete shedding of a known identity—is made tangible and felt on the page. The final state of being "lighter by the weight of a lifetime" is perfectly earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is archetypal but executed with precision and depth appropriate for a mythic fable. The boy's motivation is established through potent images (the frayed leash) rather than exposition, and his final choice feels earned and embodied in the climax. The guides function as a collective entity with a clear, unwavering purpose, and Mara's few actions carry significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.6)
    The bellhop's characterization is exceptional, achieving a complete and moving arc from hollowed functionary to an agent of change purely through embodied action and interiority. The internal conflict between "frostbitten hope against the warmth of forgetting" is sharp and earned. The final choice is compelled by a credible shift in motivation, and the story's last word, "Enough," lands with the weight of centuries.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thimble's motivation is crystalline, and his final "small, sad expression" provides a crucial layer of emotional cost beyond simple victory. The characterization is strong and consistent. However, to reach the highest echelon, the internal conflict—the weight of his duty versus the cost of truth—could have been dramatized as a more active, contradictory impulse during the climactic action, rather than a purely post-facto emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority lacks significant contradictory impulses. The journey is driven more by a professional quest that turns mystical than by a deep internal conflict. Her final state of an anchored witness is earned, but the path to it is more of a direct pursuit than a struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation to "discover meaning" is clear and consistently drives her actions. The internal state is well-embodied through specific physical sensations, such as "toes curling against the cold ferrocrete" and the hum traveling "into her soles." The trait "awkwardly confident" is demonstrated rather than just stated, lending authenticity. The final change is earned, though her realization is articulated with a touch more diagnostic clarity than a character might possess in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lila’s characterization is exceptional, with her past as an insurgent providing clear and consistent motivation for her present actions. The hidden bullet, carved with “destiny is a seed,” is a brilliant piece of backstory that makes her final choice feel both inevitable and earned. The only minor weakness is the slightly too-quick acceptance by the community, particularly the elders, which lessens the perceived cost of her defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira's interiority is rendered through specific, embodied details like "somatic markers," which avoids cliché and diagnostic language. Her motivation is clear and her internal conflict between joy and grief is palpable. The final shift from "survivor" to "witness" is earned through the on-page ritual, representing a profound but realistic change with the felt cost of carrying her grief forward.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear arc from “crestfallen” to a state of earned acceptance. Her motivation to survive the library's pressure is made concrete through specific, artistic choices—weaving threads of paint, painting a door—that feel deeply rooted in her identity. The internal conflict is embodied in her interaction with the warped portraits and fragmented cards, making her final act of creation a powerful and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alba's characterization is strong and consistent, rooted in her "serene anger" which is made causal to the plot. Her motivation—seeking answers over escape—is clear and drives the narrative. However, the final dialogue ("Time slows in crisis because we expand to fill it") slips into diagnostic label-speak, momentarily turning the character into a mouthpiece for the theme at a peak moment, which slightly compromises the otherwise potent interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Tatiana’s internal state is rendered through potent, embodied specifics—"her body trembled more than usual, something between fear and hope," and her conflicting loyalties are dramatized, not summarized. The final, visceral "hunger for cinnamon" is a masterful stroke, grounding a world-changing political act in a specific, personal, and sensory longing that feels utterly true. The motivation, “He said speak so I spoke,” provides a deeply personal and earned anchor for her public rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and her core contradiction—a pacifist daughter of a bounty hunter—is well-established and drives the central conflict. Her interiority is concrete, though at times overly articulate, bordering on thematic summary (e.g., "she chased continuity through chaos"). The final choice to offer the rose is earned by her prior actions and values, particularly the "inculcating" of the plants, making her renunciation of violence a credible and costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, defined by the core trait of being “cool-headed,” which is not merely stated but demonstrated in her deliberate actions. The story’s central conflict culminates in the sacrifice of this exact trait, making her final transformation from cool to “burning” a deeply earned and resonant change. The interiority is specific and evocative, particularly when she "transliterates her own emotions into the absence of sound," turning abstract grief into a tangible, powerful action.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Octavia’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are perfectly aligned with her specific characterization. The internal conflict is clear, and her final shift from seeking closure to accepting an ongoing duty is an earned, resonant change. The contradictory impulses—to preserve a legacy while erasing its shame—are embodied in her precise, almost ritualistic actions. The emotional progression feels authentic to this highly controlled character.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is singular, powerful, and utterly clear, driving every action from searching for a lullaby to the final, self-inflicted tattooing. The change is earned through a visceral, on-page choice with a permanent cost, transforming her guilt into a bearable physical mark. The characterization is realized through action and a consistent internal landscape, avoiding any diagnostic summary in favor of embodied grief.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    The character's motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied action rather than summary. The central conflict between holding on to meaning and letting it go is well-dramatized through her interaction with the mandala. The final choice to embrace the "unlearning" as permission is earned with a visible cost—the release of memories—fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characters' motivations are exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a shared, exhausted empathy that feels earned. Interiority is rendered in concrete, poetic detail ("history folded like wet parchment around my lungs"). While Azim and Leylah are very similar, this convergence serves the story's textural goal of a shared consciousness healing a shared trauma, making their dynamic a strength for this specific narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.5)
    The ghost's motivation is exceptionally clear and poignant, rooted in a desire for an ungranted encore that evolves into a more profound act of creation. The internal conflict is beautifully rendered through contradictory images like remembering her death while also remembering "tomorrow’s dew." Her final choice to dissolve into possibility feels earned, a perfect sublimation of her initial, more personal desire for applause into a lasting, selfless legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The "affectionate skeptic" is not just a label but a dynamic internal conflict dramatized through choices—signing waivers with a smile while checking locks twice. This contradiction is embodied and resolved into a new synthesis by the end, earning the change. The interiority is concrete and specific, particularly the translation of somatic markers into a map, which externalizes her internal process beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is established clearly and tested, leading to a meaningful transformation from an active "map maker" to a receptive "voice." Her interiority is uniquely embodied through the heat-mapping technology, avoiding cliché. The final shift in understanding is earned by the climactic encounter, and the cost—the obsolescence of her former role—is felt, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character is defined by her quiet competence and singular purpose, which is compelling. Her motivation, inherited from a dying keeper, is clear and sufficient for the story's mythic scope. The final choice to answer the prophecy's question by placing the pearl button is an excellent, earned action that demonstrates a change in understanding. While the interiority is strong, it lacks a moment of true, simultaneous internal conflict; her journey is a steady unfolding of understanding rather than a struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong and efficient. The protagonist’s core trait, “prudently daring,” is demonstrated through action, not just stated. His motivation to fix a past failure is clear and embodied in the pillbox. However, some interiority verges on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., “fixing what’s broken begins with admitting the fracture”), slightly undermining the otherwise subtle portrayal of a man grappling with regret and unused courage.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.4)
    The coachman’s characterization is exceptional, with a deeply integrated voice and clear, potent motivation rooted in grief. His interiority is rendered with concrete, specific sensory details that make his emotional state tangible. The final choice to offer a memory is earned through a well-established internal conflict, and the cost is felt, fulfilling the character arc with a powerful renunciation that leads to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kiran's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "zen-minded potter" archetype. His internal conflict is expressed through tangible micro-choices—weighting his foot on the "blooming" or the "char"—which provides a concrete expression of a philosophical struggle. While the character serves the story's high concept flawlessly, he feels slightly more like an archetypal vessel for the theme than a uniquely complex individual, which keeps the score just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mira’s motivation, "to reflect light into dark corners," is established early and dramatized through her actions, not just stated. The internal contradiction of being "wistfully pragmatic" is beautifully resolved in her choice to act despite the odds. The feeling of "protected vulnerability" is powerfully embodied in the image of cupping a match flame, earning the emotional climax without resorting to abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is deeply rooted in her unique circumstance, and her internal conflict between the burden of memory and the need for a future is palpable. The final choice to descend is earned through a credible internal shift, turning passive grief into active purpose. The contradictory impulses of clinging to the past versus stepping into the unknown are dramatized effectively through her interactions with the sundial and the stone circle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivations for both Arin and Elian are clear, poetically established, and drive the central action. Arin's choice to give up the twig is a tangible expression of her abstract goal. However, the internal conflict lacks dramatized contradiction; the resolution feels more like a seamless convergence of needs than a choice born of struggle, which keeps it from the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lyra's characterization is exceptional, balancing professional competence with embodied emotional stress ("palms sweated," "throat tightened"). Her motivation is rooted in a well-integrated memory of her mentor, making her high-stakes choices feel both earned and necessary. The internal conflict between her reluctance and her resolve is dramatized effectively, particularly in the moment she pushes the fader despite the risks.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's core contradiction—"prudently adventurous" and claustrophobic—is established immediately and effectively pressure-tested by the setting. Her motivation is clear and personal, driving her past her fear. The final transformation, where she is "no longer claustrophobic but held by the vastness," is a powerfully earned resolution to her internal arc, directly resulting from the story's central confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, anchored in the potent contradiction of a face-blind portrait artist. His motivation to "lance the silence" is clear and his methodical actions are perfectly aligned with his nature. The final emotional release feels earned, a powerful culmination of his seven-year quest. The woman is more symbolic, but her presence provides the necessary catalyst, making their interaction a crucible for the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s character is masterfully drawn through the core contradiction of being “nervously confident,” an attribute demonstrated in action (“fingers trembling yet sure”) rather than just stated. Her motivation to honor her ancestor is clear and provides a powerful engine for the plot. The climax, where she realizes rescue requires substitution, creates a profound and earned test of her idealism, leading to a believable and costly final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is vivid and driven by a strong, albeit abstract, motivation. The fiddler's interiority is rich with specific, lyrical perceptions ("luminous disbelief," "scaffold wrap flutters... as if they were sheet music"). The final transformation is significant, though slightly undercut by moments of over-articulation, such as "The fiddler understood," which states the internal shift rather than letting the subsequent action embody it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leo's motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling blend of personal history (father) and professional failure (startup). His internal conflict is dramatized effectively through his ritualistic handling of the money. Mara serves as a perfect foil, applying pressure that crystallizes Leo's stance rather than changing it. The final dialogue exchange reframing the "loop" as a "cradle" is a powerful, earned character moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character motivations for Elara (decode) and Corin (grief) are clear and functional. However, the emotional progression feels accelerated and overly tidy, especially Corin's "first unguarded smile," which slightly undermines the weight of his grief. Elara's realization of her "heaviest burden"—fear of her own emptiness—lands with less force than Corin's, creating a slight imbalance. Their connection is effective for the plot but feels more like a necessary function than a deeply textured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.6)
    The druid’s motivation is intensely clear and her internal conflict between guarded fear and love drives every action. The final choice to become unguarded is earned through a crucible of memory and physical sacrifice, fulfilling the 9+ test with a contradictory impulse that resolves with a visible, on-page cost when she feeds the bloom her blood.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and her climactic choice has a specific, felt cost. However, her interiority relies on the repeated labels "purposefully curious" and "anxious elation" rather than showing these states through more varied, embodied perception. This repetition slightly flattens the character arc, making her internal state feel more declared than experienced, especially under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is established with visceral backstory and tested through a credible internal contradiction—the “reckless idealist” who mends her soul with futures not her own. Her final shift from impulsive bartering to deliberate self-sacrifice is earned, particularly in the moment she offers her own future to the tree. Ardan provides perfectly calibrated secondary pressure, acting as a conscience rather than a simple antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, deriving its power from a specific, dramatized internal contradiction. The conflict between the ex-roadie's trauma and the appraiser's factual insulation is shown, not told, particularly in the recital of the cloth's provenance. The final choice is a direct, earned result of this internal pressure, making the character's transformation both credible and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear and earned internal shift. The transition from “haunted ambitions” (grant money, tenure) to a “simpler ache” for understanding is dramatized effectively, not just stated. Her core trait of being “kindly methodical” is not merely a label but is demonstrated in her actions, from the slow climb to the final renunciation of the fruit. The final choice feels inevitable and potent, a perfect crystallization of her changed values with a clear, felt cost (losing professional currency for ineffable wisdom).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian's internal conflict between cartographer and mechanic is compelling, and her motivation to preserve wonder is clear. The resolution, where her identities settle "like nacre," is earned through the central ritual. However, the characterization dips slightly into over-articulation with lines like "This was the method," which feel more like authorial explanation than embodied thought, slightly reducing the immediacy of her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in her past as a bunker inspector. The internal conflict between duty-bound isolation and a desire for connection is well-established through her confessions, which serve as potent character backstory. However, some moments of interiority lean towards over-articulated self-awareness, such as "each glow a fracture in the armor Mara wore against feeling," which slightly undermines the otherwise concrete embodiment of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained by a rich, specific interiority. The internal conflict between regret and the need for release is dramatized through potent micro-choices, such as testing the graffiti's wisdom. The final change is earned through a credible, on-page process, culminating in a confession where emotion is embodied in the accordion, which gapes "like a wound."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dreamer's motivation is clear and her climactic choice—sacrificing the belief in a lie to gain an authentic truth—is earned and compelling. Her interiority is conveyed with powerful allegorical actions, such as her signature detaching from the page. However, some epiphanies are summarized ("She understood then...") rather than fully dramatized through a more textured internal struggle, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation to weigh the dream against the empire is the story's unwavering core. Her interiority is rendered with unique, concrete details, such as the "quieter revolution humming in her own ribs" and her inherited mystical talents. The final choice is earned through a sequence of internal revelations, and the cost is explicitly and effectively articulated, making her decision impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her unique profession. The internal conflict—hoarding sparks versus surrendering them for a greater purpose—is dramatized with poignant specificity, particularly in the hesitation before the threshold. The final choice is not just an action but an earned evolution of her character, transforming her from a preserver of memory into a proactive giver of future sparks, a change made tangible by the final image of the new salon.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—the hollowness following forgiveness—is compelling. Her character is revealed through action, like climbing the tree with the hairpin between her teeth, a gesture rich with memory and purpose. The final shift to being "kindly decisive" is an earned echo of her mother, showing a clear arc. The sister’s appearance at the end feels slightly convenient, but serves the thematic closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s characterization is compelling, with a well-defined internal conflict between professional certainty and emergent empathy. Her motivation is clear and her final decision is earned by the story’s internal logic. The contradiction between her hardened role and her desire for nuance is embodied effectively through her relationship with the symbolic objects, particularly the cloak.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptionally strong for this length, conveyed through potent interiority and embodied emotion. The central motivation—to teach a difficult lesson to her past self—creates a compelling internal conflict between knowledge and kindness. The choice to release the stone is not just a plot point but the culmination of this conflict, and the final physical state (thirteen years old, heart light) provides a tangible sense of the cost and release of her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist is more of a mythic archetype than a psychologically detailed character, but this serves the story's purpose flawlessly. Her motivation is singular and clear, and her internal state is consistently embodied through her perception of the canyon, birds, and stone. The final transformation is an earned culmination of her journey of understanding, representing a powerful and costly renunciation of her former self that is perfectly aligned with her established values.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and his internal journey from feeling obsolete to finding peace in the ordinary is earned. The change is dramatized through his interaction with the keystone and his ultimate surrender. The embodiment of his failures as "startled birds" is a particularly strong, character-specific image that makes the abstract concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.5)
    Miren’s motivation is luminous, specific, and deeply rooted in her backstory, driving every action. The shift from “hiding behind truth” to her resolution to “tell the town” marks a clear, earned character arc. Her interiority is rendered through a unique, synesthetic perceptual filter that feels authentic to the character and the story's premise.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation to "wavelength align with purpose" is clear and consistent. Her defining trait, "quietly enthusiastic," effectively frames her journey, providing a powerful contrast to the "stellar doubt." While this internal conflict is named, the struggle feels slightly asserted rather than fully embodied in contradictory micro-choices. The emotional arc from doubt to joy to certainty is efficient and earned within the story's tight, mythic scope.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    The reaper's characterization is exceptional, moving from a well-embodied state of grief ("the hollow where his own heart used to beat") to a nuanced resolution. The motivation is clear and deepens when his initial goal—to forgive by naming—transforms into a more costly act of keeping. The final change to "no longer entirely heartbroken" is earned through the on-page ritual, and his restored state is powerfully physicalized in the "crystallized names pulsing like second heartbeats."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The "lukewarm" trait is not just a label but a core principle reflected in Calen's actions, his magic, and the story's resolution. The internal conflict regarding the bosun is not mere backstory; it becomes the direct, causal key to the climax, making the final choice to speak the name feel both surprising and inevitable. This is a masterclass in earning a character's change through a crucible of past failure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lila's motivation is compelling and established with poetic economy in the line, "memory kept in one throat is only echo." Her internal conflict is dramatized through her actions—the deliberate trail of photographs—rather than summarized. The final choice to speak is earned by the preceding confrontation with her past in the watchman's shack, demonstrating a clear and credible change with the felt cost of dismantling her father's legacy of comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between logic and sentimentality is well-established, culminating in an earned change. The interiority is concrete, especially the admission of sentimentality, which feels like a genuine micro-choice. The transformation is a credible conclusion to her arc, with the cost of her physical self feeling like a chosen, meaningful price rather than a loss.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zev’s motivation is powerfully established through the memory of the lost rookie, making his meticulous, almost devotional, work feel earned and necessary. His interiority is a masterclass in specificity; emotions are embodied in the physical act of his work, and his contradictory impulses—exhaustion versus duty—are palpable. The final choice to move on to the next harness isn't just a continuation of a task but an acceptance of his burden, a renunciation of rest that carries a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is excellent, tracing a credible arc from numbness to re-sensitization. The internal contradiction is embodied well, particularly in the final moments with the return of tears ("salt stinging like thaw") and laughter. The clone's mirroring journey from flat affect to feeling is also earned through the shared, climactic act of surrender, making their convergence as "co-authors" feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation to “safeguard space for innovation” is clear and effectively tested. The story dramatizes the core contradiction between her desire for control over her “carefully plotted world” and the receptive nature that allows true, chaotic innovation to enter. Her final transformation from proprietor to caretaker is an earned change, with the cost of her certainty and control made tangible by the dissolving of her master key.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, with her actions directly serving her goal. The interiority is specific, particularly her belief about the "macerated" laughter. However, the articulated epiphany ("Elara understood: to restore lost laughter...") feels a bit too diagnostic and self-aware for a character in the midst of a cathartic, magical-realist experience, slightly lessening the embodiment of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guardian's characterization is exceptional, with its motivation and unique interiority ("dimensionally homesick") driving the narrative. The central choice to engage with the child-absence feels earned, stemming from a believable internal conflict between its vow to wait and the dawning realization of a better way. A minor weakness is the slightly too-explicit epiphany ("To make friends with uncertainty, it realized..."), but it is immediately grounded by action, preserving the story's strength.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction of "stoically sensitive" is masterfully demonstrated through the alchemist's calm, procedural approach to a deeply personal and heretical act, with his internal state revealed only through precise, embodied details like "a pressure behind his eyes." The change from "hopeless" to empowered is earned through a clear and costly sacrifice, making the final transformation both credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and poignant, driving every action from the climb to the final renunciation. The internal conflict between his grief-haunted memory and his impossible hope is resolved not with a simple victory, but with a profound transformation. The final choice to accept the “hello” instead of the final breath is an earned change with a visible cost—the letting go of a long-held, defining wound.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Cass's motivation is clear and her transformation into a guardian is well-earned. However, her characterization leans more toward an archetype than a complex individual. Her "resiliently positive" nature is presented as a static trait that enables the plot, but she lacks the internal conflict or contradictory impulses that would elevate her from a perfect instrument of the narrative to a more deeply human character.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her defined role as a "fever dream architect." The story effectively dramatizes her internal conflict between control and surrender, culminating in a final choice of endurance that feels earned by the preceding pressure. Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in the way her memories are weaponized against her, providing a concrete cause for her final shift in strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is a seamless fusion of professional dissatisfaction and profound, embodied grief, which drives every action without a single word of diagnostic summary. The final change is not an erasure of grief but a profound reframing of it, earned through the preceding physical and perceptual journey. The contradictory impulses—grief pulling down, curiosity pulling outward—act simultaneously to create a compelling and believable internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her primary internal shift is articulated through a diagnostic label rather than dramatized. The line, “Yet incidental heroism, she was learning, began exactly there,” functions as an unearned epiphany, summarizing the theme rather than showing a complex internal process. While her actions are consistent, her interiority feels more like a statement of purpose than a lived, contradictory experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation and internal conflict are well-embodied, but the final character change is slightly undercut by being stated directly. The line "her claustrophobia transformed into a fierce tenderness" summarizes the shift rather than allowing the preceding actions and final image to fully dramatize it, which feels like a missed opportunity for a more resonant close at this level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions like counting her pulse and using the shard. Her internal conflict is compelling, and the final choice is well-earned. However, the internal monologue veers into diagnostic self-awareness near the end ("I understood: to defragment was not to delete but to rearrange..."), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional for a solitary protagonist in a ritualistic narrative. Motivation is pure and unwavering, rooted in heritage, and the transformation is made concrete and costly through the change in her veins and voice. The story wisely avoids complex internal contradictions, focusing instead on the profound weight of a single, focused duty, which is perfectly suited to the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vale’s motivation is clear, deeply rooted in her relationship with her brother, and her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific details ("bitterness crystallizing into frost on her tongue"). The transformation of her motivation from personal grief to a cosmic mission is earned by the story’s climax. Her final actions are a direct and believable consequence of her profound change, demonstrating a character arc that is both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The violinist's motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied through the physical act of playing. The choice to funnel her fear into the final note is a strong climactic action. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by the overly explicit epiphany near the end ("she understood what the gap...was"), which summarizes her internal change rather than letting the action and image carry the full weight of it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb. Six's motivation to "foster something the war had orphaned" is established early and demonstrated through every action. His interiority is beautifully embodied in the "thunderstorm in a bottle," which acts as a barometer for his emotional state—pulsing with impatience, shuddering with memory, and finally singing with remembrance. The final shift in his perception of the checkpoint lights is an earned change, solidifying his arc from a courier of messages to a purveyor of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The carpenter's motivation is established with poetic precision in his desire to "coax" silence "into shape." His transformation from a silent servant of hush to its active interpreter is earned, particularly through the poignant backstory fragment of his younger self, "unable to give voice to the joy." The final choice to board the carousel is a powerful embodiment of his internal change, moving from static restorer to dynamic participant, with the cost being the solitary, predictable world he's leaving behind.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mireille's characterization is exceptional, established immediately through embodied action ("sanely eccentric gait") and a specific, nuanced worldview. Her motivation is clear and compelling for this length. The line comparing her belief in the scarf's power to how "cartographers believe dragons: provisionally, and with a map" is a masterful piece of interiority, revealing her blend of pragmatism and wonder without a single generic phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.4)
    The librarian's motivation is crystalline, and her final renunciation is earned through the climactic interaction, paid for with the tangible cost of her shadow. Her internal conflict between cataloguing and creating is beautifully rendered through action and perception. The character’s change in understanding is profound, though a final thought like "dreams checked themselves in and out like books" feels slightly too neat for a character defined by such strange, specific longings.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The locksmith’s motivation is compelling and consistent, rooted in a seven-year quest that gives his actions immediate weight. His interiority is conveyed through strong, embodied sensations like the melody fluttering "against the inside of his ribs." The character’s adherence to the axioms of his Order provides a clear logic for his seemingly esoteric actions, and the final dialogue with Aelira shows a subtle but earned shift in his understanding of his own craft.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is rendered with exceptional precision, rooted in the specific, painful loss of her mother's voice. The internal conflict between her past self, who made a naive bargain, and her present self is dramatized effectively in the climax, not just summarized. The final change is earned and complex; she doesn't just regain her years, she accepts them as "heavier now," a sophisticated resolution that demonstrates a deep understanding of character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her character is expressed through precise, specific actions, like walking backwards. The change at the end—turning to walk forwards—is earned and lands with impact. The phrase “combative tenderness” is a bit self-descriptive, acting as a label, but her actions successfully embody this contradiction, especially in the climactic dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.4)
    Arin's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply integrated into his role as a "dream-tender." The internal conflict—creativity as both a gift and a "leak"—is established with nuance. The final choice to sacrifice himself is not just motivated but feels inevitable, a direct result of his established values, making the cost embodied in his "silvering" hands profoundly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her defined role. Her interiority is well-established through embodied sensations like the "weight of every silence... pressed against her ribs." The character's transformation is subtly and effectively shown in the final lines, where her own mask, once cracked by absorbed grief, is now whole—a powerful earned change that resonates with the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and deepens satisfyingly from professional curiosity to an empathetic mission. Her defining traits—perceptiveness, methodical curiosity, and “shielded openness”—are not just stated but demonstrated through her actions, particularly the meticulous comparison of the films. The final choice to create a new kind of map is an earned transformation, showing a credible change rooted in the events of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict between being an "algorithm" and a man capable of understanding surrender is well-drawn and compelling. The final choice to renounce the technical finding for a philosophical one is an earned change with a clear cost. The character of Dee serves as an effective, minimalist catalyst, avoiding cliché through her gentle, resonant presence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation to articulate the unspoken is established immediately and drives every action. The character change is earned through a ritualized confrontation, making the final shift from silence to song credible. The one moment of overly direct self-awareness (“she understood the ghost was the part of her that had learned silence”) is a minor flaw in an otherwise masterful depiction of embodied internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina's motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with precision, particularly her "affectionate detachment." The captain's transformation is earned through her actions. However, the decrypted diary entries, especially the final one, veer into aphorisms that feel more like thematic summaries than authentic personal records, slightly flattening the captain's voice in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and compelling, evolving from a professional crisis into a personal quest for meaning. The internal conflict between her data-driven past and her new emotional framework is well-dramatized. The shift is earned through the pressure of the situation, though the moment of direct address to the clouds ("You there, the angry cumulonimbus...") feels slightly too performative for an internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in her paradoxical identity as a face-blind portraitist. The internal conflict is elegantly shown in her steady hand versus her racing heart as demolition begins. The final realization that she is painting the guild members she cannot recognize is powerful, though it lands more as a lyrical insight than a fully dramatized, choice-altering turn. Still, for this length, the characterization is concise, potent, and internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driven by a "diligently curious" nature that is shown, not just told. The internal conflict between her hunger for discovery and the captain's warning about caution is palpable and resolved in a decisive final choice. The character arc from feeling "oddly stranded" to the "thrill of first sight" is earned and embodied.

    The character's motivation is established with poignant backstory and drives a clear, high-stakes choice. The final renunciation of self is a powerful change earned by the narrative's logic. While the character acts more as a mythic archetype than a person with complex internal contradictions, this fits the story's fable-like tone and short word count perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Luma's motivation is exceptionally clear and her final sacrifice provides a powerful, earned closure. Kiran's turn from curious child to leader is slightly accelerated but plausible for this length. The secondary characters are archetypal and functional, which is an acceptable compression, but their lack of interiority flattens the collective effort into a summary of skills rather than a crucible of personalities.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist is more of an archetypal figure than a deeply personal one, a choice that serves the story's mythic tone well. Her motivation is clear and her internal conflict—the tension between the lives saved and the cost of those savings ("cities unbuilt, loves unmet")—is powerfully dramatized in the mirror scene. The final transformation from a mechanical "adjuster" to an embodied "carrier" of the lullaby provides a satisfying and earned character arc, even within this compressed, lyrical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nadia’s characterization is exceptional. Her core conflict—the reluctant caretaker who nonetheless possesses deep, inherited competence—is dramatized through her precise, minimal actions. The shift from a personal motivation (seeking the nut for her own release) to an altruistic one (saving the hikers) is earned and provides a strong central arc. The final choice to use the nut for others feels both sacrificial and, paradoxically, like the true key to her freedom, which is beautifully paid off in the end.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's interiority is rendered with profound specificity through the lens of her profession, using polymer chemistry as a unique and consistent vocabulary for processing grief. The internal conflict between scientific rationalism and the need for absolution is palpable and drives the narrative. Her final, earned shift in perspective feels authentic and powerful, meeting the 9+ test for contradictory impulses resolved with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character’s motivation and transformation are clear and conceptually sound. The arc from passive waiting to active service is earned through on-page choices. However, the interiority operates on a consistently high metaphorical plane, making the narrator feel more like a perfect vessel for the story's concept than an individual with deeply embodied, contradictory emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira's characterization is exceptional, conveyed almost entirely through her unique sensory perception. Her motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is clear and compelling, and her interiority is made concrete through the inventive language of taste and texture. The climax, where the subsumed emotion threatens to drown her, provides a moment of genuine struggle that balances her immense competence, earning the resolution. The character is a seamless fusion of concept and execution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sora is a compelling archetypal figure whose actions are perfectly aligned with her stated motive. However, she functions more as a graceful agent of theme than a character with tangible internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her competence is absolute and her path is without internal friction, which limits the characterization's depth even as her actions beautifully serve the story's lyrical purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The engineer’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract, diagnostic labels ("synaptic plasticity," "neural pathways") rather than fully embodied emotion. While this fits the "engineer" persona, it keeps the character at a distance, making her more of a vessel for the story's concepts. The transformation is described more than it is felt through contradictory impulses or visceral struggle, muting the cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motivation is singular and effectively drives the plot. However, her interiority, while consistent with the story's poetic tone, remains largely conceptual. Character is revealed more through the intricate narration of her perceptions ("prism-minded sight") than through embodied emotional conflict or contradictory impulses, making her feel more like an elegant vessel for the theme than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sculptor's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply embodied ("carried silence... like a stone under her ribs"). Her interiority is specific and her actions are directly driven by her core belief in "empathy in motion." The final unfinished sentence is a minor thematic label that slightly undermines the "show, don't tell" mastery of the preceding paragraphs, but the character's journey to a decisive, costly choice is otherwise flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his internal state is consistently portrayed. However, his characterization is weakened by an over-articulation of his own epiphany. His dialogue with the keeper ("victory and defeat are twins separated only by perspective") and the narrative summary of his new purpose feel more like a thesis statement than an earned, embodied realization, slightly flattening the complexity of his journey.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira's motivation as an "eclectic pacifist" is clear and consistently drives her choices. Her internal conflict is well-defined, and her actions align with her established traits. However, her interiority occasionally becomes overly articulate, with epiphanies like "empathy is not a gift given but a frequency shared" reading more as a polished thematic summary than a raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ari's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her character is well-defined through her unique sensory gift and her focused, ritualistic behavior. The final realization, while fitting, verges on over-articulating the theme, slightly dampening an otherwise strong and embodied internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from scientific inquiry to personal risk. The character is defined by competent action under pressure, particularly her choice to enter the vortex against a ticking clock. The final shift in her understanding is earned, though the moment of epiphany (“Kael understood then…”) is slightly declarative rather than fully embodied, a minor friction in an otherwise strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The investigator's motivation to "cultivate foresight" is established and then demonstrated through her choice to take Mara's place, earning the climax. Her actions align perfectly with her professional, adaptive character. However, the story lacks a moment of true internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene; her progression is competent and linear, which holds it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and her synesthetic interiority is rendered with rich sensory detail. However, she functions more as a flawless archetype than a complex individual; there is no visible internal contradiction or struggle. Key emotional moments are summarized with poetic labels (e.g., “Emerald became courage, violet became memory”), which reads like high-register diagnostic speak, abstracting the feeling rather than embodying it with visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to understand her failure is clear and compelling, driving every action. Her internal conflict is brilliantly externalized through the ritual with the driftwood. The final shift in her understanding of "keeping" feels earned and profound, a credible change resulting from her intense, focused introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    The character's motivation to solve emotion like an equation is clear and drives the narrative. Her arc from detached observer to an embodied participant in emotional "mathematics" is compelling, culminating in the shift to her "own unborrowed uncertainty." While the characterization is powerfully aligned with the central concept, it remains slightly more a vessel for the idea than a fully idiosyncratic personality, a minor trade-off in an otherwise exceptional piece.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal journey from a "jittery relic courier" clinging to "practiced lies" into a "bearer of perpetual invitation" is both compelling and earned. Her contradictory impulses—fearing the loss of anonymity while craving the redemption promised by wonder—are dramatized effectively through her interactions. The final choice to share the pendant rather than surrender it is a powerful culmination of this arc, with the cost of her old identity and mentor-defined purpose felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and evolves under pressure, from intellectual curiosity to a forced personal transaction. The interiority is concrete, especially the involuntary memory of her mother's scarf, which provides a strong anchor for her changed perspective. The final choice to leave the prism feels earned, representing an acceptance of a more complex truth than the one she sought.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is intensely clear and sustained. Her character as a weaver is not merely decorative but essential to solving the puzzle, demonstrating excellent integration of trait and action. The final image of her “stoically sparkling tears” provides a moment of powerful, embodied contradiction, fulfilling the story's emotional arc with grace. Her competence is balanced by her palpable despair, making her struggle authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and her internal conflict—the desire to preserve a specific memory versus the need to save her community—drives the narrative compellingly. The transformation from "meek" to a leader who sets the terms of salvation is earned through a high-stakes choice. The embodiment of the cost is excellent: "a hollow where laughter had been, but also a new tensile strength threading her veins."

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the plot toward an earned change. Her interiority is revealed through a distinct perceptive mode fitting a “sensory map maker.” The final choice to release the pilot’s memory by grounding the shard is a powerful renunciation that feels inevitable, with the cost of that knowledge settling into her bones on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elias is superb; his reticence is not a label but an embodied state, making his quiet actions—pressing sea glass to his palm, stacking stones—carry immense weight. His internal conflict between a belief in "tides, not ghosts" and the undeniable spectral presence is handled with subtlety. The final, whispered vow is a powerful and earned shift from silent duty to active, personal commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation to forge a new dawn is established immediately and remains the unwavering engine of the plot. His interiority is conveyed through potent, embodied actions—laughter like thunder, a grin at a terrifying vision—rather than navel-gazing. The brief reflection on the typhoon that "spoke in thunderclap puns" is a masterful use of backstory, anchoring his identity as a herald and making his "shadowed elation" feel earned and specific. The final choice to become the storm is an inevitable, fitting apotheosis, fulfilling his arc with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his arc from watchful observer to permeable participant is well-defined. His interiority is expressed through vivid, character-specific metaphors tied to his craft as a dye master. The final transformation feels slightly abrupt and less like a struggle than a seamless epiphany, and the concluding line "watchful no longer" is a bit too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority relies on overly explicit epiphanies. Phrases like "Elara understood that..." function as thematic summaries rather than earned, embodied realizations, bordering on the diagnostic label-speak forbidden for high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority fused through poetic, embodied action. The protagonist's contradictory state—a keeper of memories who is herself forgetting—is not just a label but the engine of the plot. The final act of sacrifice, feeling her memories scatter yet smiling, is a powerful and earned moment of renunciation that perfectly fulfills the story's internal logic and emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with a clearly defined internal conflict between her old and new understanding of compassion. The change she undergoes is earned through specific, on-page realizations, and the cost of renouncing her old self is palpable. The final choice to write a new invitation is a perfect dramatization of her new internal state, making her arc feel complete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation and internal conflict are rendered with exceptional clarity and specificity. Her transformation from a passive, grieving archivist of loss to an active cultivator of defiance is earned through the scene's crucible. The line "her curse was carrying the grief of every vanishing" establishes the stakes perfectly, and her final choice is a direct, costly response to this burden.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's transformation from a meticulous preserver to a liberator is profound and well-motivated. The internal conflict crystallizes instantly upon recognizing her own vow, making her subsequent high-stakes choice feel both surprising and inevitable. Her core trait, "gently meticulous," is cleverly shown to persist even when her entire purpose is inverted, which adds depth to the final actions.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lila's internal conflict between her mission and her heritage is expertly dramatized. Her final choice to protect her community—at the clear cost of her father's freedom—feels both surprising and inevitable, a culmination of her history and the immediate pressure from Roe.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The characters serve the lyrical concept well, but the protagonist's core trait—skepticism—is more of a label than a dramatized internal conflict. The shift to belief and action happens very quickly after Mara's explanation, feeling more like an acceptance of plot terms than a hard-won change of heart. Mara's characterization is effective, efficiently establishing the stakes and history needed for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Characterization is exceptional. The artist's motivation—to answer an internal calling and reclaim her identity—is clear and compelling. The internal conflict between her self-imposed exile from art and her intrinsic nature as a creator is dramatized through potent symbolic actions, not just summarized. The final change feels earned, a direct result of confronting her past via the painting and pigment, with the cost legible in her tears and the bittersweet act of painting her sorrows.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lysandra's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is effectively externalized through the "living barometer" of the wilting vine. Her character arc from withholding half-truths to embracing spoken honesty is earned, culminating in the meaningful choice to write a new letter on "plain rice paper." The change feels slightly compressed due to the story's length, but the internal logic is sound and lands with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bell tuner's motivation to "preserve the color of wonder" is exceptionally clear and sustained. His interiority is conveyed through potent, embodied actions like "chest rising in silent laughter," which align perfectly with his goal. The brief backstory of the rain-smeared drawing provides a concrete, poignant anchor for his abstract quest. The character serves as a powerful archetype, and his final change to carrying a "new internal resonance" is earned, though the absence of any internal contradiction or friction keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lumen’s motivation to resolve his inner static is clear and compelling, and his final choice feels earned. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic summary rather than embodied emotion, particularly in lines like "the roses had taught him longing, and longing had taught him fear," which labels the process instead of letting the reader experience it through Lumen's specific perceptions and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's characterization as a sensitive curator is strong and her motivation is clear and consistent. Her method of listening to objects and people drives the plot effectively. However, her professional competence is so complete that it prevents any meaningful internal conflict or struggle; the investigation phase reads as a smooth execution of a known skill rather than a difficult choice, which slightly flattens her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and her competence is established through embodied action rather than exposition. Her defining trait of "calm defiance" is powerfully shown in the moment she exhales before placing the die. While her interiority is consistently filtered through her poetic, practiced movements, the story lacks a moment of sharp internal contradiction or a visible struggle against a flaw, keeping her slightly at arm's length and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is powerfully established as a “blade behind her ribs,” and her actions flow directly from this internal pressure. Her interiority is rendered through specific, embodied perceptions, such as feeling the fluctuating gravity, which avoids generic emotional labels. The final choice to taste the memory is a quiet but profound action, earning a sense of reconnection that feels true to the character’s grief-sharpened sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The summoner's motivation is clear and her internal shift from control to listening is the story's core strength. However, her interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language, such as the direct statement, "She realized the prophecy was not a warning but a question." This slightly undermines the otherwise well-embodied struggle, making the epiphany feel more stated than viscerally earned in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is masterful in its economy. The narrator’s internal journey from skeptical observer to active participant is rendered through concrete, embodied reactions. The widow is a perfectly pitched enigmatic mentor, and the motivation for both characters—one seeking connection, the other fulfilling a legacy—converges with powerful emotional logic at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is fierce and clear, driving her actions from skepticism to a resolved new state. The arc is compelling and earned. The change feels slightly linear, lacking a moment of deep, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a well-realized internal conflict between survival and peace. Her change to a state of earned stasis is credible and cost-laden. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into overly articulate, diagnostic self-awareness, as when she thinks "the sanctuary was not a place but a moment," which reads more like an author's thematic summary than a raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    The singer's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply personal, rooted in the memory of her mother. Her defining trait—being "richly perceptive"—is not merely stated but demonstrated in the climax, where she hears "the beauty in the sorrow." This perception directly motivates her final, difficult choice to preserve the echoes, renouncing the simpler path of silencing them, which lands as an earned and character-particular resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nadia's motivation to "salvage something pure" is beautifully externalized through her meticulous ritual, showing a professional competence that makes her grief more potent. Her interiority is concrete and specific to her unique profession. The characterization is held just shy of a 9+ score only because her internal state is one of focused execution rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously within the key scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    The characterization of the philosopher is potent and consistent, with her core motivation—testing a theory about care—driving every action. Her defining trait of "demure audacity" is skillfully demonstrated through her quiet ascent and confident interaction with the guard. The guard's brief but vivid memory of his grandmother provides a powerful external validation of the story's theme, making the connection feel earned rather than coincidental. A slight deduction is for the interiority, which at times feels more like elegant authorial summary than a distinct character's thought process, particularly in the phrasing of the "scintillatingly somber truth."

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lina's characterization is exceptional, progressing from a sharply defined professional role—conspiracy debunker—to someone forced into a more profound ethical position. Her motivation is clear and her internal conflict at the climax is potent and earned. The story successfully dramatizes a significant change in her worldview, shown by her final choice, which renounces her initial methods for a deeper form of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassia’s motivation to “shape a new dawn” is powerfully established and consistent, driving every action from soldering wires to interpreting static. Her internal state is beautifully embodied through specific, tactile details like “sleeves already stiff with solder burns.” The transformation from “lonely visionary” to the leader of a congregation is earned and provides a satisfying, resonant character arc, with her final stance at the portico showing a credible change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet's motivation is established with lyrical precision and his actions are entirely consistent with it. The brief moment of internal conflict—"his own sob he pretended was only salt in the wind"—provides a crucial layer of vulnerability. The final change, marked by the satchel feeling lighter from "gleaned redemption," is a subtle but earned resolution, beautifully embodying his internal shift without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s core trait, “logically emotional,” is effectively dramatized, not just stated; she simultaneously calculates frequencies and winces at the sound. This internal contradiction directly enables the climax, where she combines technical skill with empathetic humming. The characterization is lean but purposeful, with every detail serving the central action and thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara is a well-realized archetype, her motivation to "unyoke the town from its own panic" is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her internal philosophy of a "patient revolution" is demonstrated through meticulous, specific actions rather than just stated. While her competence is compelling, she lacks a significant internal contradiction or flaw tested in-scene, making her feel more like a force of nature than a person grappling with doubt, which keeps the score just shy of the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya's characterization is superb, driven by the internal contradiction between her mentor's detached methodology and her own intuitive connection to the past. The progression from a practiced calm to a state where her "hands trembled, yet her voice remained watchfully calm" is an excellent depiction of contained crisis. The final choice is a direct, earned consequence of her journey, showing a fundamental change in her values with a clear cost—the shedding of professional armor for a more vulnerable, purposeful identity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rowan's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative compellingly. His internal conflict is well-embodied through his actions. However, Elias's echoing of Ms. Vale's exact phrasing feels overly convenient, a moment where character logic serves thematic neatness rather than emerging organically from his established personality, slightly undermining the realism of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ludo's motivation, the "yearning algorithm," is abstract yet executed with perfect consistency. Her actions are all driven by this clear internal compass, and her final contentment feels earned. While the characterization is more archetypal than psychological, it's a powerful and fitting choice for this mythic, poetic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is intensely personal and clear from the start, driving every choice. Her role as a “memory keeper” creates a compelling internal conflict when she chooses to lie, prioritizing familial memory over corporate protocol. This micro-choice is a powerful reveal of her values. The final transformation into a wanderer is a swift but earned change, foreclosing her old life at a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a specific, embodied interiority. Her core motivation—duty—is immediately clear, and her unique gift of tasting emotions is shown, not just told, through concrete actions like "sorting emotions by texture." The change is marked by the cost to her tool, the fragment, which serves as a powerful proxy for the personal cost of her peace-keeping, foreclosing a path and making her choice resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional. Her initial motivation as a euthanasia tourist provides a profound internal conflict that is tested and transformed, not simply resolved. The shift from a passive seeker of her own ending to an active listener for others is earned through the story's central encounter. The final micro-choice to teach the boy solidifies her new hierarchy of values with a felt sense of costly endurance, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear and compelling motivation to understand a past relationship. The protagonist's interiority is rendered with concrete, specific details drawn from his profession, which prevents the reflection from feeling abstract. The final choice to burn the letter fragment is an earned transformation, moving from preservation to acceptance, showing a credible change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    The walker’s motivation is immediately clear and her internal arc from mourning to stewardship provides a strong, earned closure. The embodiment of emotion is excellent, particularly the initial "gauze... darkened by tears yet strangely honest" and the final tactile connection to the parapet. The character's core contradiction—needing to preserve a memory by letting it go—is dramatized effectively through the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    The archivist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she functions more as a steadfast catalyst than a character with an internal arc. Her defining trait, "perceptively calm," is demonstrated but never truly tested, leaving her characterization feeling more archetypal than deeply personal. The trumpet man's brief appearance offers a more dynamic, if small, emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.4)
    The scholar’s transformation from a reticent academic who decodes to a participant who testifies is exceptionally well-earned. The micro-choice to speak the word “Mother” is a powerful pivot, motivated by the crystal’s demand for “honesty stripped of ornament.” The resulting shift in his understanding—from linear analysis to recursive experience—feels profound, and his final act of surrender is a credible renunciation of his former self with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prophet’s characterization is exceptional. His core contradiction—being "precognitively forgetful" while desperately "clinging to echoes"—is not just a label but the engine of the entire narrative, motivating every choice. His interiority is rendered with concrete, particular sensory details, avoiding abstraction. The final change into a sculpture is a profound and earned resolution, a form of stasis that perfectly culminates his internal conflict between searching and forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully rendered, evolving from a technical problem-solver to someone confronting a deep internal ache. The internal conflict between possessing memory (repairing, trapping light) and surrendering to its impermanence is dramatized through her choices. The backstory of the boy's portrait is a perfect, concise anchor for her flawed perspective, making her final epiphany—"the camera had only obeyed the law of impermanence"—feel deeply earned. Her change is credible and shown through action, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear, high-stakes motivation. Her interiority is rendered through specific, unique sensory details (“tasted like copper and silence,” “scent of hope... a clean mineral breath”) rather than generic emotional labels. The central contradiction—seeking a “flawless” goodbye with broken tools—is dramatized in every action, culminating in the final, earned choice to complete the circle with her own pulse, a powerful embodiment of her “decisive kindness” that carries a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is established with poignant specificity in the opening beats ("since the night spoons bent reality and her mother’s shadow walked away without her"). Her actions are consistently driven by this initial wound, and her defining trait, "quietly deliberate," is shown, not just told, in her methodical approach to both the runes and the discovered staircase. The flicker of internal conflict when faced with the reunion ("she had rehearsed this reunion in dreams, but dreams had no weight") provides a moment of genuine, embodied emotion that grounds the fantastical events. The final choice is earned, representing a shift from seeking to integrating.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ivy’s character concept as a "forgiving skeptic" is strong and well-established through her actions and memories. Her motivation to reframe mistakes is clear and compelling. However, her pivot from professional skepticism to active participation in a magical ritual is rapid, relying more on the established metaphor of "bone setting" than a fully dramatized internal shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and deeply felt, rooted in her mother’s memory and the village’s need. Her interiority is beautifully embodied in the changing weight of the sea glass. The transformation from carrying a private burden to creating a shared light is earned through her actions. The characterization is strong and compelling, though the dialogue at the end ("they simply learned how to stay") feels slightly more like a thematic statement than an authentic character utterance, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is powerfully clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion. The core contradiction between the sting of public shame and the private, proactive ritual is compelling. Her final stance is earned, though the phrase "protected vulnerability" is repeated, feeling slightly like a label rather than purely emergent emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story’s conceptual frame. The novelist’s internal conflict between commercial success ("polite applause") and artistic truth ("raw edge") is made tangible through her ritual with the seashell and her confrontation with her characters. Her final change is earned through a convincing psychological ordeal, and the cost is legible in the transformed seashell, satisfying the 9+ test for an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is simple, fierce, and consistently dramatized through her actions. Her interiority is conveyed through memory and embodied emotion ("tears that tasted like gratitude and rain"), avoiding diagnostic labels. While her competence is high, the story earns it through her connection to a deep lineage of practice; the primary struggle is against a world's forgetfulness, not internal doubt, which fits the story's fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, defined entirely through embodied action. Her motivation to preserve memory and hope is made concrete in the ritual. The internal conflict between her necessary patience and the "hurry" of grief is masterfully handled in a single, potent line, providing a visible cost to her actions without disrupting the story's quiet tone.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlen's motivation to "reverse-engineer wonder" is established early and pursued with methodical consistency. His interiority is conveyed through his precise, detached actions and his focus on reflections rather than reality. The character is somewhat subordinate to the story's high concept, feeling more like a necessary functionary for the theme than a person wrestling with a deep internal conflict in the moment; his final state of being "neither happy nor sad" is an earned stasis, but the path there lacks significant internal friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The weaver’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal state is embodied with exceptional specificity, as in burdens “pressing against her collarbones like wet wool.” The character’s change from trapped to free is earned through a focused, ritualistic progression that feels both mythic and psychologically true. The final choice to walk toward the ruins demonstrates a shift from passive endurance to active creation, fulfilling the arc with a quiet but decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal transformation is earned and embodied through her physical actions. The characterization is nearly flawless, though the epiphany ("love is not erased...") momentarily slips into diagnostic articulation rather than remaining purely embodied, a minor stumble in an otherwise masterful portrait of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent internal contradiction: she is a “resolute scavenger” of dreams whose only path to peace is to release everything she has gathered. Her motivation to stabilize her chaotic sense of self is made tangible through her negotiation with her own ghosts. The final choice to let go is deeply earned, with the cost articulated in the line “traded everything and still feels whole,” making her transformation both credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara is more of a function than a character, a vessel for the story's theme of "stoic wonder." Her motivation to find "equations for hope" is abstract and lacks a personal, embodied stake, making her actions feel preordained rather than chosen under pressure. While her competence is clear, the absence of any internal conflict, doubt, or meaningful struggle makes her journey emotionally level and her final understanding feel more intellectual than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistently embodied. The internal conflict between his artistic vision as a "prayer" and the commercial demand for a "product" provides a strong, coherent core. His final reconciliation feels earned, stemming directly from the pressures and revelations within the garden scene.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is compelling and evolves credibly from an external search to an internal transformation. Her core flaw—an over-reliance on certainty—is established early and provides the necessary internal conflict for her shift toward instinct. The final change is earned through a series of costly choices, culminating in the severing of the rope, which makes her newfound serenity feel authentic rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hara's motivation is clear and consistent, but he functions more as a reverent vessel for the story's theme than a character with deep internal conflict. His transition from observer to participant is well-handled, but the story lacks a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously to force a costly choice. The characterization is elegant and serves the story's purpose, but doesn't quite achieve the complexity needed for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The traveler’s motivation and interiority are rendered with exceptional specificity, and her final shift in perspective is earned. However, the story dips into diagnostic self-awareness with lines like “understanding the geography of healing required her to chart every contour of the wound,” which slightly flattens the character’s voice by articulating the theme too directly in a moment of emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Halric’s motivation is powerfully established through his connection to concrete relics of the past. The internal conflict between grief and hope is well-embodied, and his final choice feels like an inevitable, earned culmination of his character. The transformation from a prince of memory to an agent of rebirth is potent and credible within the story's fairy-tale logic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, embodied, and tested on the page. Her internal conflict between carrying a trauma and transforming it is dramatized through her interaction with the boy and the ultimate choice to give away her talisman. The characterization is nearly flawless, though the epiphany “She understood then that compassion was not the absence of pain...” is a touch too self-aware, momentarily stepping out of embodied experience into thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc from skeptic to believer is legible, but the pivotal internal conflict ("skepticism flickered") feels brief for such a defining trait. The late introduction of her own personal memory reads as a convenient shortcut to emotional investment rather than an earned development. Her characterization is effective but serves the allegorical plot more than it reveals a complex, contradictory individual.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sentimentalist’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, rooted in a desire to break a destructive family legacy. Her interiority is conveyed through lyrical action and perception, particularly in her interaction with the gear. The character reads as a potent archetype of healing, but this symbolic weight slightly overshadows the development of more specific, contradictory personal traits that would elevate the characterization from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority occasionally lapses into overly diagnostic self-awareness. The moment "Mara understood the lesson: grief is not a monument but a migration" feels more like an authorial summary than an earned, embodied realization. While her journey is compelling, this tendency to articulate the theme so directly slightly undermines the character's otherwise subtle and specific internal world.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, driven by a powerful and consistent internal contradiction between her resentment and her profound sense of duty. Her motivation to regain trust is made tangible through the physical act of reading the inscriptions, and her interiority is concrete and specific, as when she feels another's guilt "travel through the wood into her own pulse." The final choice to return and recalibrate the clock is not just a solution but a costly act of acceptance, perfectly earning the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional. The story establishes a core trait—“blithe constancy”—and puts it to a crucible test. The motivation to understand the past sharpens into a deeply personal choice, and her final act of renunciation, choosing "Tomorrow," is an earned and moving expression of her values. The internal conflict is dramatized beautifully, culminating in a choice that carries a clear and deeply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cartographer's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her professional past and desire to create. Her internal conflict between unbridled imagination and necessary constraint is dramatized effectively through her interaction with the vellum. The final choice is a direct, earned consequence of this resolved tension, making the character's arc feel both complete and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.4)
    The copyist’s motivation is established with superb economy and clarity (“to teach dust to tell stories”), rooting her diligence in a powerful, world-defining goal. Her internal state is beautifully embodied in the concept of “thistled calm,” a specific and contradictory feeling that avoids cliché. The final choice to conduct is a perfect culmination of her identity as a musician and her newfound role as a storyteller, an earned change that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is powerfully embodied through the central ritual of creating and wearing the mask. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding abstraction; the conflict between hiding truth and seeking clarity is dramatized in her actions. The micro-choice to whisper lies to the mask ("You were always safe") is a superb moment of contradictory impulse acting in scene. The final change is earned by this ritual, with the cost felt in the tears that mix with soot.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation as a "wannabe philosopher" practicing "rational rebellion" is exceptionally well-realized. The internal conflict is not merely stated but dramatized in the choice between the "cleaner story" and the "messier truth," with the decision resting on the principle that "truth has a tensile strength." The final action is a perfect synthesis of the character's established traits: philosophical, rebellious, and ultimately, pragmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ms. Vale's motivation to "unlearn hatred" is clear and compelling, creating a potent internal conflict against her professional role as a creator of harmony. The transformation is earned through a specific internal process. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly diagnostic language, as when she "subtracted noise by naming it: fear, pride, the brittle armor of certainty," which reads more like a summary of therapy than an embodied emotional experience mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s motivation is powerfully embodied through sensory detail and decisive action. Her interiority is rich and specific, particularly in the tasting of memories from the seed. However, her one spoken line, “We don’t need to rebuild what was; we need to grow what never was allowed,” reads as a direct thematic statement rather than earned, informal wisdom, slightly flattening the character at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marisol’s motivation to preserve wonder is clear, but her defining trait—being “involuntarily truthful”—feels underutilized. It shapes a brief, atmospheric interaction but doesn't force a costly choice or create a central conflict; the main plot would function similarly without it. Her epiphany, "The bees didn’t fail; they transformed," feels more like an observation delivered to her than an insight earned through struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype, but her motivation is dramatized with exceptional clarity through the ritual. The transformation from "noticer" to "listener" is a potent and earned character change, foreclosing her previous mode of being. Her interiority is conveyed entirely through a distinct perceptual filter, making her a consistent and compelling, if mysterious, figure whose contradictory impulses (ritualistic control vs. surprise at the note) feel authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aurele’s motivation is clear and its transformation from rigid guardian to a conduit for mercy is well-realized. The backstory is efficiently woven in, explaining the origin of its kindness. However, the internal conflict feels somewhat resolved from the start ("certainty cracked harder than marble"), making the present-moment choices feel more like an inevitable unfolding than a struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, and the central contradiction of the "grim optimist" is masterfully sustained and resolved into a new, earned equilibrium. The character's intellectual and obsessive traits are demonstrated through every action, from marking sigils to writing proofs, making the final internal shift feel inevitable. The choice to offer the "chipped three" is a potent, earned action that resolves the internal conflict with a visible, symbolic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's character is strong and consistent. Her defining trait, "methodically hopeful," is expertly dramatized through her patient waiting and persistent painting, providing a clear motivation that evolves from a personal artistic quest into a communal act of healing. The secondary character of the janitor serves as an effective, if slightly convenient, confirmation of her hope. Her internal journey from exhausted isolation to peaceful, trusting sleep feels entirely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lysandra’s motivation is immediately clear, and her arc from a passive preserver to an active creator is the story's powerful core. The internal conflict between preservation and creation is dramatized with a tangible cost—burning the manuscripts she once catalogued. Her interiority is rendered in specific, poetic language ("rosewater dread," "fierce as yeast") that makes her transformation feel both profound and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.5)
    Marrow's motivation is philosophically rich and perfectly grounded in his profession as a clock maker who is "sick to the teeth of fate's metronome." The internal conflict is masterfully shown when reliving his past pain clarifies his resolve, and the story culminates in a potent, earned character change symbolized by the "first asymmetrical smile of his life." The characterization is flawless, deeply integrated, and drives the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and their competence is established through action rather than assertion. The character is defined by a central contradiction: a professional who traffics in fear but must confess their own dread to win. The final transformation from cursed to controller is earned through a specific, intelligent choice, and the lingering “repulsive allure” provides a compelling, non-sanitized cost for their victory.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prophet’s motivation is archetypal yet powerfully rendered, rooted in her parents' philosophy: "turn obstacles into instruments or be crushed by silence." Her competence is balanced by a flicker of fear, which she manages rather than ignores, lending her credibility. The final choice to embrace the danger and transform it is a direct, earned consequence of her established worldview, with the cost being the perpetual vigilance required for this life, as new clouds are already gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Neris's motivation is exceptionally clear, progressing logically from a "quiet drive" to an "obsession" and finally to a climactic "urgency." Her character is defined by her actions, and the final choice is powerfully embodied with a specific physical cost ("lips bled into the reed"). The internal consistency and the earned nature of her transformation are highlights.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong and consistent, but the core internal conflict between rationality and outrage is stated more than dramatized as a simultaneous, contradictory impulse in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional, realizing Elara through a unique synthesis of professional precision and profound sensitivity. Her motivation to be an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is immediately grounded in her established skills, making her actions feel both credible and resonant. The story earns her final commitment, "I will remember for you," through a series of increasingly intimate interactions with the space, making the change from observer to participant feel like an inevitable, costly apotheosis.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the central, embodied conflict between her identity as a “logical page indexer” and the impossible evidence she uncovers. Her motivation is established early and sharpens effectively, compelling every action. The shift from a cataloguer of verdicts to a curator of hypotheses is an earned, meaningful change with a clear conceptual cost—the forfeiture of certainty. Her interiority remains consistent and specific, culminating in a final state of "tranquilly perceptive" awareness that feels both new and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is poignantly established and her actions are a direct, credible expression of her grief and craft. The change from mourning to purpose is earned through the ritual. The final smile feels genuine because it is preceded by a concrete vision of the future, not just an abstract emotional shift. The interiority is strong, though slightly weakened by the on-the-nose summary of her epiphany, which verges on diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied. Her transformation from survivor to “perturbation” is earned through a series of specific, character-driven micro-choices, such as repurposing scientific instruments for grief. The final choice to transmit the coordinates is a perfect culmination of her internal arc, with the thumbprint still flecked with henna providing a powerful, concrete link to her initial trauma and new resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from a technical need to a deeper existential quest. Her interiority is conveyed with concrete, evocative imagery, such as her heartbeat sounding like "a Morse code she had never learned." While her internal conflict is more a process of dawning realization than a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses, the final shift in her understanding of "belonging" is well-earned and resonant within the story's lyrical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and powerfully embodied. The internal conflict between her guilt-driven profession and her need for truth is palpable and drives the narrative. The final change feels earned, though the line "I chose silence, and I can choose voice" is slightly too diagnostic, briefly pulling back from the otherwise concrete and sensory interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb, particularly for Mara. Her competence and weariness are embodied in her actions and perceptions, like studying faces "the way sailors read clouds" and wielding silence "as a weapon or a cradle." The prisoners are sketched with potent, specific regrets that define them instantly. The story masterfully achieves an Earned Stasis for Mara in the final image, where her "furrowed face" reflected in the pull confirms her role in an endless, costly cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The navigator's motivation is powerfully rendered through his actions and concrete interiority, particularly the linking of regrets to the blinking utility lights. The internal conflict is embodied and his final change feels earned. The score is capped below the 9-band because the daughter's dialogue, while thematically resonant, verges on a tidy, articulated insight that feels slightly less authentic than the preceding internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a potent and consistent interiority. The protagonist's arc from a 'clean slate' to kindling empathy is earned through a crucible of past actions. The motivation is clear and compelling, and the change is dramatized with a tangible cost. A minor deduction is for a single line of near-diagnostic language ("the first unprogrammed emotion") that slightly distances the reader from an otherwise deeply embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ayla’s motivation is powerful and her internal state is rendered with specificity, particularly the contradiction in her “reluctant metamorphosis.” Her choice to surrender her humanity is earned and carries a palpable cost. The characterization is nearly flawless, showing contradictory impulses acting in scene to create a compelling emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    The cartomancer's motivation is primal and clear, driving the narrative with potent emotional weight. Her interiority is rendered with exceptional, character-particular metaphor ("minutes puddling under the crib, hours clotting behind the rocking chair"). The internal conflict between guilt and a desperate need for recovery is embodied in her actions and the objects she carries, culminating in an earned and resonant change from recovery to acceptance. The line "perplexed by how surrender could feel so much like flight" perfectly captures a complex, contradictory emotional state at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lin’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her steadfast pacifism. The interiority is mostly concrete, embodied in the gravity effect, but the explicit naming of "shadow work, the long reckoning with everything denied" dips into diagnostic self-awareness that slightly lessens the emotional impact. The final renunciation of the Tear is well-earned and carries a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal journey toward comprehension is well-tracked. The characterization is strong, but the final epiphany, while earned, is articulated with a slightly too-perfect, diagnostic clarity ("her emptiness was the space where others’ fullness could echo"), which lessens the impact of an otherwise embodied transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, conveyed through precise, motivated action rather than exposition. Her defining trait, "calmly inventive," is demonstrated, not stated, in the methodical way she navigates the darkness. The shift from dutiful sentinel to revolutionary agent feels both surprising and inevitable, culminating in a final, quiet smile that carries immense weight, showing a profound internal change with masterful economy.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a motivation that is both mythic and deeply personal. The protagonist's internal state is rendered with precise, embodied details ("heart ticking like a metronome"). The final shift from seeking a finite end to embracing an endless, caring process is an earned and profound change, with the cost—the return of the curse—making the new understanding poignant and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    The poet's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, "furiously tranquil," is brilliantly demonstrated through her meticulous, focused actions under pressure. Her interiority is conveyed through potent, specific metaphors rather than abstract labels. The change from seeking private understanding to broadcasting a public truth is earned and powerful, culminating in a final state of resolve that feels inevitable. The character is a stunning portrait of artistic defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is superb for this length; both Lysandra and the envoy are established as distinct archetypes with clear, dramatized motivations. Lysandra's internal values are revealed consistently through her micro-choices, particularly in how she uses the coded system not to defeat but to enlighten. The final earned change in their relationship—from adversaries to companions—is grounded in the preceding symbolic actions, showing a meaningful shift with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Lark’s central contradiction—the transient self clinging to an identity for a newfound purpose—is dramatized powerfully through the tremor in their hands and the "Anchor" scene. Mira serves as a perfect foil, her pragmatism and hope grounding Lark's poetic nature. Their bond is established with remarkable economy in the Neruda exchange, feeling both instant and deep. The choice to resist the "molting" gives the story a potent internal stake that beautifully mirrors the external one.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    The pianist's motivation is crystalline, and his arc from wistful remembrance to defiant creation is earned within the story's logic. His internal conflict is powerfully embodied in his actions—not just playing music, but physically trespassing into memory to rewrite it. The final, unguarded smile is a quiet but potent indicator of a fundamental, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional. Mira’s motivation is established with fierce clarity and her unique trait—being "empirically whimsical"—is not just a label but a demonstrated mode of perception that drives the plot. The internal conflict between protecting memory and the necessity of doubt is beautifully realized, culminating in a final state of "luminous doubt" that feels earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Helini’s motivation is clear and potent, rooted in a specific failure of mentorship that fuels every action. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through embodied perception ("salt air threading into the hollow of every apology she never gave") rather than summary. The final earned stasis, where her bonsai trees become ships instead of anchors, is a powerful and earned reconfiguration of her internal state, demonstrating a profound character shift with a felt cost of accepting uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's stubbornness and role as undertaker root his motivations consistently, driving choices like entering the water and writing names with embodied cost in bleeding fingers; interiority shines in contradictory impulses, such as hesitating on his own name before committing, revealing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila's motivation as a persistent leader is clear and intensifies through her actions and interior reflections, with embodied emotions like touching the bell to her lips revealing contradictory impulses of relic-like reverence amid exile's weariness. Internal conflict shows in her dialogue with Tomasz, where she endures doubt to affirm community, earning a meaningful stance crystallization with felt cost in the gathering. The single on-page relationship with Tomasz applies pressure, forcing her to articulate values, though secondary characters like Soraya are more illustrative than crucible-deep.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mei-Ling's motivation is deeply rooted in the past life memory, intensifying through embodied emotions like trembling and breathing changes that reveal contradictory impulses between fear and compassion. Interiority is concrete and particular, with flaws like unhealed grief complicating choices, leading to an earned renunciation of separation from her pilgrim self. The final mending, with its felt cost of releasing sorrow, is compelled by prior causality, as seen in the tear's pulsing rhythm aligning with memory footfalls. Relationships and status dynamics are irrelevant here with a single character.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and intensifies through embodied tremors and childhood echoes, compelling her dissolution; interiority is concrete and contradictory, with curiosity overriding fear in the disintegration beat. However, some emotions lean toward abstract poetic labels rather than fully embodied contradictions under stress, slightly softening peak authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The liberator's motivation as guardian is clear and intensifies through strategic decoding and planting, with embodied emotions like flexing fingers and humming the lullaby showing contradictory impulses of regret and fierce hope. Interiority is concrete, rooted in her mother's memory, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts ongoing struggle with the cost of discarded chains visible on the page. A minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness during the arrow shot slightly flattens complexity, but it doesn't touch the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation as a hearing-aid designer turned silence-shaper is clear and intensifies through embodied memories, culminating in the earned renunciation of the device; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses like chasing betrayal while soothing absences shown in micro-choices under aurora light. The solitary POV excels in revealing flaws through perceptual cross-wiring, avoiding stock phrasing, though the brother's memory feels slightly summarized without altering mid-story tactics. Emotions are embodied in synesthetic perceptions, aligning actions with motives effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thief's motivation to steal and reinterpret illuminated moments is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in a poetic interiority that shows contradictory impulses like capturing then releasing portraits. Emotions are embodied in tactile details, such as the jar's warmth like a second heartbeat, revealing her values under pressure. The final renunciation earns its cost by foreclosing her thieving path, visible in her lighter pockets and fuller heart at the release. Minor stock phrasing in reflections slightly limits depth, but the hierarchy of values shines in the spiral bouquet code.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)

Interiority is concrete, with emotions like "heart hammering against ribs" showing embodied contradiction without therapy-speak. The twin's late appearance limits relationship crucible, but the protagonist's flaws drive mistakes that compound toward earned stasis in accepting vulnerability as power.

    The robot's motivation is clear and intensifies through guilt distillation, with embodied emotions in the fusion moment showing contradictory impulses like denial and acceptance acting simultaneously. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and the final amalgamation earns a credible change with felt cost in integrating past failures.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “buffering” of reality and the moment she labels the wings “Post-Flood Specimen #1–12” crystallize her arc. The contradiction between her neutron-star precision and the slow erosion she witnesses is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation of loud endings carries visible cost in the sealed envelope beside the data drives. One slip: the phrase “kindled humility” edges toward label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and glass-specific; the mentor’s palm-code and “follow the pause” crystallize motive. Yet the cartel remains off-stage, so external pressure is second-hand and the final renunciation (“not to avenge but to remember”) is asserted rather than forced by an immediate, embodied choice—cost is felt but not paid in a visible forfeiture beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s interiority is embodied and specific—frost-numb palms, salt-blistered tongue—yet the final choice to bow and leave the forks feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is present but not fully dramatized in body or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her loneliness, compulsion, and fear are felt in micro-choices like pressing the tapestry to the wall and reading aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)

    The gravity-defier is revealed through embodied contradictions—hovering yet weighed down by memory. Micro-choices (kneeling on cracked hospital marble, hurling the tablet) crystallize her values under pressure, earning a wrenching renunciation that forecloses returning. Interiority never drifts into therapy-speak; flaws remain credibly self-destructive.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s embodied deafness and tactile pedagogy are vivid; her arc from numbness to renewed feeling is earned through the drum ritual. The interior contradiction—yearning for sound yet teaching through vibration—drives every micro-choice. Cost is palpable when tears absorb without echo. Only the brief Garrick interaction lacks full crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—protective secrecy vs. honest disclosure—drives every beat; the micro-choice to bury the tube enacts her renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“tasting iron silence”) grounds her solitude without therapy-speak. Motivation remains consistent: integrity through deferred disclosure. The final image of “wings not bound to pigeons” crystallizes her earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from broker to mourner is dramatized through micro-choices (uncorking the vial, tasting regret). The final renunciation carries visible cost—empty vial, evaporated weight—yet the epiphany “every scent is a seed” edges toward tidy wisdom, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drifted poet's internal contradiction between playful ethics and real moral weight is palpable; the embodied "tenderness that surprised him" as he reties knots shows earned contradiction. Micro-choice—retie or leave untouched—carries visible cost: the fugitive "not free but forgiven." Backstory integrates precisely: three layers of rope become visceral memories that alter his present stance. Motivation tightens with every loosened fiber; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensorially rich and embodied; the violinist’s contradictory impulses—renouncing music yet conducting silence—play out in real time. The final choice to return nightly as listener is earned by the causal chain of giving voice to the greenhouse. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of her bow and the hush that now “follows her like a well-trained echo.”

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drives the story; Vale’s detachment vs. leaking longing is shown in mirror-touch and final hand-clasp, shaping the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marisol’s contradictory impulses—shrewd broker vs. secret benefactor—are embodied in micro-choices (sealing envelopes like spice, pinning the returned photo). The final tear-salted realization carries visible cost and reconfigures her stance. Secondary characters (Theo, Marta) apply direct pressure that alters the trio’s operation. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior ache is embodied (“luminescent… pulsed”) and her contradictory desire for solitude vs. witness is dramatized through the weaving act; the final micro-choice (carving the reed) crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Fen and the newcomers apply immediate relational pressure, but secondary voices blur slightly. No unmotivated leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s need to finish her bestiary is clear and embodied throughout; each action draws from that motive, and the final stasis (carrying the birthplace in ink) is a costly renunciation of certainty when she listens for the giant’s next skipped beat. Interiority is consistent, concrete, and avoids therapy-speak. However, her secondary values or contradictions gain less visible exploration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat tightening, the glass eyes warming—yet the “mathematics of emotion” remains abstract, slightly undercutting the final renunciation. The Earned Stasis (keeping parentheses open) is credible, but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—hunger for visibility vs. self-erasure in walls—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (coaxing tape, pressing it under the board). The final act of giving away the fragment costs her the custodian’s literal voice, earning her a mirrored visibility; cost is felt but not yet paid in full, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her need for control and the storm’s refusal to obey is dramatized in every tactile beat. The final renunciation—setting the leaf down and naming vines aloud—earns its cost through prior micro-choices and accumulated grief. One minor slip: “reluctant metamorphosis” is named rather than fully dramatized in her body, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ishka’s exhaustion, paint ritual, and the mother-backstory brooch all serve her charged micro-choice—handing over the heirloom. One slip: the stranger’s “hungry eyes” and star voice edge toward stylized archetype rather than specific interior, damping full individuation, but the final beat still feels earned by prior yearning. Minor deduction capped at −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pilgrim’s interiority is embodied (boots humming, pulse doubling) and her micro-choice to press the pearl to the wall is causally rooted in her stated motive. Clairvoyant’s tear-fractured violet moment crystallizes his flaw and cost. Relationship crucible is minimal—only a sleeve-grab that fails—so relationship bullet not fully met. Earned stasis: both accept an open future, cost visible in the seer’s cracked voice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s exile-grief and archivist instinct are vivid in embodied beats (salt on lashes, sole-ripples), but the interior contradiction—collect vs. let go—stays lyrically asserted rather than forced into a single costly choice; the final “blew silence” is luminous yet feels arrived at more by spell than by prior micro-choices that foreclose an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—cartographic control vs. emotional surrender—are embodied in every beat; the scar, the backward-facing seat, the final inward-pointing arrows all dramatize her renunciation of mapping others and acceptance of mapping herself. The cost is visible when the fortress folds into the punch and the cracks heal, foreclosing her old habit. Interiority stays specific and sensory, avoiding therapy-speak. Only the mother’s translucent appearance edges toward convenient spectral exposition, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s skeptical stance is embodied early and tested by the tile’s memories; her micro-choice to kneel and transcribe crystallizes the shift from doubt to witness. The internal contradiction—yearning to flee yet choosing to carry grief—drives every beat. Final renunciation (leaving the tile but taking the song) costs her certainty and earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s boredom-to-renunciation arc is embodied in micro-choices (palm on wall, tracing fields, stepping onto prism). The final turn—choosing to turn back after seeing every goodbye—earns its cost through prior causal beats and the charged image of lanterns dimming. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “bored beyond the reach of words” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied rest compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—filial loyalty vs moral revulsion—are embodied in the ink pot’s weight and the chill of Alvarez’s wrist; her micro-choice to stamp the forged certificate crystallizes the cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final “borrowed shoes” image shows earned endurance with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the director’s flatness keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liang’s studious compulsion to “measure silence” and “collect textures” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—palming the lamp, annotating pitch, speaking textures aloud. The interior contradiction (panic vs. discipline) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation—accepting that invented histories are “lanterns”—carries visible cost as the lamp dies and silence thickens. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Trait-driven mistakes (abandoning the shop) compound and are not tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“lungs still bargaining with air”), but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational until the final image; the shift to “become the space between stories” is resonant yet feels slightly unearned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—“gloomy cheerfulness” shows contradiction in one breath. Micro-choices (bowing harder, adjusting pegs) reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation—accepting myth as tool—carries visible cost: “I miss believing.” Only flaw: mentor’s warning is summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s interior contradiction—drowned past vs floating present—animates every beat; her orderly intuition shows in tactile graffiti navigation, her final shout embodies hopeful desperation with earned cost. Tomasso serves as a catalyst rather than character, but Lila’s agency remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the inspector’s grief and curiosity collide in the micro-choice to embed the grain in the capsule. The final endurance—whispering a promise to the orchid—earns the Earned Stasis closure with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s embodied blindness, tactile craft, and maternal grief fuse into a single, urgent motive; the drone’s pulse against her cheek and the lullaby hummed at the end crystallize her interior stakes with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—cartographer’s precision vs. vanishing dread—are embodied in her tactile micro-choices (tracing condensation, tasting water). The final step onto moving water crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she forfeits the outpost’s safety for emergence. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One minor slip: “subtly confident” is asserted once without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tuner’s interiority is implied through deliberate action and silence, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; his patience is shown rather than tested, so the final renunciation (walking away) feels pre-ordained rather than earned at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory vs. surrendering it—are dramatized in the perfume-drop beat; the cost of letting go is embodied in the fading smile and heavier empty vial. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leif’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth while fearing its weight—are embodied in micro-choices (balancing on the railing, threading mirrors). The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: he “wears the hush like armor,” foreclosing escape. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the father remains off-page, limiting relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"her voice like wind through dead leaves"—but the ghost bride’s contradictory impulses (love vs betrayal) are summarized rather than enacted in-scene, keeping her final forgiveness slightly abstract rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—threads loosened by memory, body tracing paths while mind hovers—yet the shift from passive sleepwalker to decisive weaver is slightly under-cooked; the cost of her final stance (keeping both eyes open) is implied rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the diaspora returnee’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet fearing its ghosts—surface in her tactile handling of bones and roots. Motivation to “restore lost faith” is dramatized through micro-choices (speaking to bones, aligning the sundial) rather than stated. The final renunciation—leaving the orchard yet carrying its soil—earns its cost on the page. Voice remains coherent, though a few lyrical abstractions (“time learns to circle”) edge toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—chalk moon/sun date, refusal of glass nostalgia—but the final backward walk reads as gesture rather than earned renunciation with visible cost; contradictory impulses are present yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—foolish mask vs. lethal intent—are dramatized in every micro-choice (needle-prick cipher, giggle to mislead). The final renunciation of her own stitched future is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (blood-star beacon). Interiority is embodied and specific; no diagnostic label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—fierce tenderness vs. vanishing—are embodied in the shard’s dual role as weapon and balm; her micro-choices (cutting, kneeling, bleeding onto the blank letter) escalate under pressure. The final renunciation (“I choose to stay present”) is earned by the causal chain of embodied cost: blood, dissolution of letters, scarless sealing. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding therapy-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lin’s interior contradictions—the professional linguist versus the guilty sister—are embodied through tactile ritual (coral pressed to cast) and her micro-choice to offer the fragment to the doctor; the moment stakes “I’m translating you back to the tide” as earned renunciation with visible cost in her open palm.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s interiority and embodied emotion are strong (the “knowledge network” murmurs in her ears, the daydream folding like warm cloth), yet her final renunciation—walking away from the mural—reads as lightly cost. Lacks a visceral contradiction between joy and risk; the orchard’s warning is voiced by setting, not via an internal fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid—her “methodically playful” trait drives every micro-choice, from tapping the nickel to pressing it into the heart. The contradiction between restoring permanence and craving impermanence is embodied, not stated. The final renunciation—leaving brushes, walking lighter—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Only the hobo’s miniature scale strains embodiment slightly, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s contradictory impulses—smuggler’s bravado vs. caretaker of fragile language—are embodied in micro-choices (tongue-hiding seed, pitcher-plant flick) and culminate in the earned cost of grafting his spark outward. Interiority is vivid, but the “candidly cryptic” label is slightly external; still, the final renunciation of safety feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—tears tasting of magnesium, vine etching poems onto skin—yet the centuries-long arc compresses contradictory impulses into summary rather than scene, blunting the cost of the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—gloves “so thin the orchids seemed to breathe against her palms.” Motivation to save Liora’s name is clear and intensifies through micro-choices (climbing, cranking, coaxing). The final refusal to speak her own name is an earned renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: caretaker’s “pulse stuttered” is a stock bodily cue.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s three-month silence and the “carefully reckless” trait are embodied in her deliberate shattering of the ink well; the interior contradiction between fear and defiance is dramatized through micro-choices (writing promises, guiding melody to Arden). Cost is visible: she breaks the vessel that gave her power, accepting fragility. Relationship with Arden shifts from adversary to co-guardian under pressure. Minor slip: Councilman’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority—trembling certainty while the volcano "inhales"—gives subtle, embodied contradiction; choices align with her invented craft and mentor-haunted ethics. The late, unearned "harmony of stone and water" abstracts motive a hair; otherwise the arc carries the cost of silence bought with chain tension.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—preserving a lost music she can’t hear vs. rewriting her past—are dramatized in every micro-choice (sealing the skylight, forging papers, releasing the pigeon). The final renunciation of her violinist identity is earned by the prior cascade of lies and the returned feather’s promise. Monsieur Vidal’s quiet complicity supplies relational pressure without stealing focus. Interiority is embodied (dust on eyelashes, trembling paper) rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iona’s interiority is embodied and specific—kneeling, tracing grain, knees trembling—yet the father’s sudden reappearance and tidy exposition (“I built the maze to teach you…”) undercuts the earned cost of her three-year separation. The final silence is credible, but the reunion feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“shared exhale that fogged her helmet”); the final realization that she is the child who sent the bottle is earned through the city’s memory and the feather’s flare. Motivation (“learn the rhythm of belonging”) drives every beat, culminating in resonance rather than possession. No contradictory impulses are dramatized mid-scene, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her cheek against the shard, the salt on her tongue—but the only micro-choice that alters her path is the final whisper before planting the third seed; earlier beats are observational. The earned shift from searcher to carrier is credible and costs her the need to keep searching, yet the contradiction between passive witnessing and active decision stays under-dramatized until that last beat. Still, the embodied emotion and singular POV keep her above the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Finch remains an enigma of contradiction—sociable yet solitary, virtuoso yet vagabond—and the piece captures this in embodied micro-choices (squaring the bishop to chase starlight, spiraling marbles). His visibility of cost peaks when literal syrup becomes violet halos for three strangers, then crystallizes into Eden’s coordinates for the girl. One pass of filter-phrase (“silently asked to dance”) keeps it south of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysandra’s interior contradiction—yearning to dance against the law yet feeling the garden’s root in her heart—is embodied in every arabesque and palm-to-marble beat; the moonstone’s dissolution into bloodstream constellations dramatizes the cost of claiming memory. Her final “Remember” carved in starlight seals an earned stasis: exile becomes studio, with visible forfeiture of anonymity. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority stays specific and sensorily grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile handling of glass, the grit on her palms, the memory rings in the tide pool all reveal her values under pressure. The final choice to leave the flawed panes is earned by the prior communion with the tide pool and the refracted epiphanies she witnesses. The only minor drag is a touch of therapeutic self-labeling (“understood that every flaw was a fingerprint of time”) that slightly dilutes the embodied insight.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the need to forgive herself—is embodied in the ash moth on her scar and the prism of pain; every micro-choice (opening the box, speaking the childhood line, pressing the scar) is rooted in prior causality and carries visible cost. The scar itself shifts from shame to text, a credible renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s desire remains abstract; the “equation” is more motif than conflicted internal engine. Her epiphany arrives more as conceptual mirror-telescope than as painful renunciation—no true contradictory impulse plays out in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara's echo-mapping talent is vivid, but interiority drifts into thematic exposition; the diary revelation justifies her return yet feels summarised rather than lived. Sensory perception repeatedly enables action, satisfying the attribute, but one late epiphany is telegraphed.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid, particularly around the locket’s borrowed pulse; the transfer of heartbeat at climax registers as Earned Stasis with palpable cost. However, her backstory twin-sister beat is delivered in one expository line that summarizes without on-page cues, diluting motive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelia’s contradictory impulses—negotiator’s cunning vs. penitent’s surrender—are embodied in the ritual pacing and the silent kiss to the clipboard; Kelis’s presence forces a micro-choice that alters their shared status. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final renunciation (leaving the terrace lighter) is earned and carries visible cost. Only the “operative gentleness” label risks a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—profit-driven drought vs. secret tenderness for the egg—are dramatized in every beat; her final renunciation costs her empire and is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and character-specific. The micro-choice to pour contraband water visibly forfeits her leverage, sealing the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lys’s interiority is rich—her chastity as “blade” and refusal to sing reveal layered motive. The final absorption of the prism is earned by prior withholding and reverence. Yet the story keeps her essentially flawless; no misstep or internal contradiction surfaces under pressure, so the arc feels slightly pre-ordained rather than risked.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lucien’s serenity and calligraphic skill are embodied motives: every puppet and word is driven by his quiet need to undo past propaganda, turning silence into actionable ethical performance; interior contradictions flare in moments of mirror-script and recantation, costing him prop choices and shaping the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the “blushing stillness” and the tactile knotting of thread—yet her contradictory impulses (need to commemorate vs. acceptance of forgetting) remain slightly under-dramatized; the final renunciation is earned but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is embodied—guilt vs. need to restore names—yet the “technically gentle” refrain edges toward label-speak. Micro-choices (re-braiding rope, softening wax) align with motive and carry felt cost. Final renunciation of war-casting is earned. Still, the reflective blocks tilt past the 20 % allowance and momentarily stall embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Foresight evolves from observer to walker through embodied choices—gathering, shedding, redefining self in dream and sand. Flaws and wild emotions are dramatized, not labeled; final renunciation is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Naram-Sin’s austere inner life meshes twin poles of scientific detachment and elegiac longing; every action—fasting to save oil, tracing numbered corridors—springs from that paradox. The cautious empathy earned at the climax (signed covenant, surrendered star-charts) feels inevitable yet freshly painful. Voice commands tension with ember-quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory pacifist/schemer identity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing pin to sternum, touching stone) and her final renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, but the shift from “scheme” to “listening” is slightly compressed; more friction on the page would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirror maker’s interiority is vivid—her deliberate breaths, the warmth of brass on her lips—but the “why dreams flee” question is stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation feels earned yet slightly abstract, lacking a concrete cost on her body or craft.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mender’s interiority is vivid—her traded eye, the ribbon’s scent, the grandmother’s face in leaves—but the daughter’s feistiness is asserted rather than embodied in on-page choices, and the final reconciliation feels slightly under-motivated by prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-preservation—are dramatized in the orchard and bathroom beats; her final surrender is earned by the prior Möbius-loop logic and carries visible cost (memory erasure). Interiority is concrete, e.g., “vomited stardust,” avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “understood that the shell was not a key but a seed,” but it is immediately embodied in the planting action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her cross-legged research, the “carefully resourceful” refrain—but the epiphany about empathy gaps is narrated rather than dramatized, softening the final renunciation’s cost. Still, her shift from rescuer to gardener-librarian is consistent and carries felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ghost syllable I could not swallow”), but the final choice—“Go”—leans on lyric assertion rather than dramatized contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—“confusion was merely clarity waiting to be translated”—and her tactile micro-choices with rope and seal reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (door fading) carries visible cost: she files the seal under “Recovered Histories,” a new category that forecloses further access. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapkeeper’s interior contradiction—hoarding silence vs learning to release it—plays out in embodied micro-choices (closing fist, opening hand, scoring her arm). The final renunciation costs her the comfort of certainty and is earned by the preceding beats. Flaw: the energy being’s motivation remains abstract, slightly softening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the retrocognitive gift is dramatized through tactile contact and painful visions. Her contradictory impulse—trusting coincidence yet fearing its cost—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (leaving the prism, following crows) is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost: she abandons the tower’s safety to keep the beacon alive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat tightening at “thirty-three stones” crystallizes the cost. The contradiction between her desire to curate memory and her fear of betrayal is dramatized through the act of measuring shadows. The final renunciation—writing what chose her—earns its charge because the obelisk’s void has already forced her hand. Only a slight reserve keeps it from 9+: the micro-choice hierarchy could be even sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her chant, gait, and tactile handling of the rag knot reveal contradictory impulses (defiance vs. playfulness) that culminate in the cannon choice. The final renunciation—turning weapon into bouquet—earns its cost through prior causality and visible flame. Minor: no second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is textured and embodied; the moment he touches the cicada and memory floods sideways is a vivid micro-choice that reweights his stance. Mara’s arrival supplies relational pressure that forces a shared decision, altering their estrangement. The final renunciation—leaving the cicada undisturbed—earns its cost through prior sensory and emotional accumulation. Minor slip: “time feels like this, I think” edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in tactile image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for open sky yet clinging to bunker identity—are embodied in the porcelain doll and the tasting of silences; her final teaching moment with her father crystallizes a credible shift from isolation to shared hush, the cost being the permanent surrender of the doll/second heart.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s “teaching silence” motive is dramatized through embodied action—her choice to guide the child with breath-control, tactile contact with the storm glass, and gentle speech rooted in her vocation. Interiority is specific and un-cliched; she both steadies the child and disciplines her own grief in the same beat. The child’s weight change when stepping off proves the micro-choice altered stakes. Minor: no flaw, but the 20-year tenure is summary—just below full 9 intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lore-keeper’s contradictory impulses—archival rigor versus adventurous risk—fuel every beat; her micro-choice to press the ruby into stone re-orders options, while the climactic renunciation of rule (sitting to remember, not reign) earns closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (iron chill against sternum, burn on shoulder) but the character’s contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is credible yet its cost feels generalized rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal contradiction—relief at volunteering versus the old Mara who monetizes bread futures—grounds every beat; embodied details like inked fingers anchor her. The final renunciation feels earned by prior regret ("I volunteer to be the pressure") and visibly costs her any future monetization.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—duty to erase vs. self-preservation—are embodied in the micro-choice to keep cranking the gramophone; the final renunciation carries visible cost as she presses the handle into earth. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the “dynasty ender” label is stated more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—guilt vs. longing—drives every micro-choice; the unsnapping of the puppet’s helm is an embodied renunciation that costs him his solitary exile. Memory return is earned by the tactile grafting of silver cords, not narrated. Flaw (desertion) complicates the final step into branching dawns. Voice stays singular; no second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the button triggers a believable emotional cascade that anchors every beat. Micro-choices unfurl the past into present stakes without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her stillness under drones, the warmth of the key, the ember-banked fire—but the boy with pamphlets remains a missed crucible; no relationship pressure alters her stance. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the final renunciation (letting the boy go) is under-dramatized, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The saxophonist’s interiority is embodied in breath, reed, and silence; his micro-choice to exhale without tone folds the prophecy inward, costing him the solo he might have played. Contradictory impulses—music vs. hush—coexist in every beat. The final renunciation is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—his “mossy delight” and walnut-stained fingers ground him—but the final transformation is more mythic inevitability than earned choice; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—oil-and-regret rag, “beneath the ashes of every plan”—and his micro-choice to kneel and dip the compass reconfigures his stance with visible cost. The shift from mending certainty to teaching improvisation is earned, though the widow’s backward-running clock is more reported than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to transform it—are embodied in every micro-choice (mercury into the crack, coin alignment). The final act of sealing the drop beside her heart earns the shift from burden to ballast with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. One slip: “factually mystical” is a label, not lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The collector’s interiority is embodied in concrete micro-choices (pressing the tooth into the musician’s palm, uncorking vials) that visibly cost her centuries-old detachment. The contradiction between duty and emerging empathy is dramatized, not narrated. The final “Thank you” is earned by prior causality and carries audible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s embodied trauma and micro-choices (counting paces, deliberate grounding) are vivid and character-specific; the final integration of mercy feels earned through the strap’s weight and the spiral walk. Interior contradiction is present but slightly undercut by near-therapy phrasing (“mathematics of mercy”).

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority is tactile (“thumb-smooth”, “salt wind”) and choices reveal hierarchy of values (trading grandmother’s tremor for indigo boat). Still, some lines edge toward theme-declaration rather than dramatized memory, slightly thinning embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. compulsion—plays out in embodied micro-choices (tracing dust, pressing warm ceiling). Her final renunciation of the elevator trade is earned by the grandfather-haunted stakes and the visible cost of leaving the mainspring behind.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid—"bottled whispers clinked," "tasted like morning frost"—and the operator’s contradictory desire for perfection-through-rupture is embodied in every micro-choice. Motive intensifies cleanly from boredom to ecstatic sabotage, culminating in the irreversible act of drinking “Forever.” The single on-page character sustains pressure without headcount clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt over betrayal vs. drive to reimagine—are dramatized in her frantic mirror-covering and later refusal to hide; the final relinquishment of the vase carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emil’s interiority is vivid—hands “remembered every lullaby,” chip dims with doubt—yet the moment of self-doubt (“was he worthy?”) is narrated rather than embodied in micro-choice, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory—her “sensibly eccentric certainty” collides with the fear she tastes in rust. Micro-choices (trapping petrichor, clipping the compass to the rope) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—refusing to cross the membrane—carries visible cost (the compass released, the map now internal) and is earned by prior psychometric immersion. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “simply joyful scent” edges toward label-speak at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the slide, the hammer of her heart—but the older Mara remains a cipher, flattening the relationship crucible. The driftwood sculptor identity is embodied through action (carving, lashing) rather than label, and the final renunciation carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—need to paint the answer vs. growing witness stance—is embodied in micro-choices (grinding lapis, withholding candle). The final renunciation of understanding for witnessing is earned and carries felt cost. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the retrocognitive burden is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (arranging debris, pressing wet finger to page). Her final acceptance of responsibility is earned by prior beats of empathic risk. Minor drift: “solemn civil-rights archivist” is stated more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s refusal of false comfort is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (setting the bottle down, walking away). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—he leaves the only relic behind. One notch off because the “conceive a civilization” beat is slightly abstract, diluting embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interior contradiction—archiving emotion while deaf to the living city—is embodied in her micro-choice to whisper a new oath; the cost is the cracked cylinder and her renunciation of passive listening. The flaw (antiquarian deafness) compounds until it forces the climactic reciprocity. One slip: the “velvet disquiet” label edges toward diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the seed-saver’s contradictory impulses—yearning to open the spiral yet fearing its rupture—play out in micro-choices (placing seeds, touching the membrane). The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost: she seals the vortex and accepts stewardship rather than possession. One notch below 9.0 because the “texture of borrowed time” remains slightly abstract, blunting the cost’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tester’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his preference for listening over noise is embodied in the moment he “closed his eyes and listened to the absence.” Micro-choice (pulling the rope) crystallizes his arc and forecloses his old coastal life; the cost is the new responsibility coiled over his shoulder.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cosmic janitor’s interiority is vivid—his slow, root-like curiosity and willingness to let the void enter him are embodied in tactile micro-choices (kneeling, pressing forehead to floor, opening his chest). The final renunciation—breathing out instead of sweeping—earns its cost through prior vulnerability. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The recluse carries clear motivation—fleeing a broken covenant and seeking truth in ruin—yet interior contradiction remains muted; his final act of reading is less a choice than an inevitable reflex. Emotional cost registers on the woman’s propolis tears and the box’s tangible weight, implying character debt rather than dramatizing it on page. Still, actions and memories align with the revealed vocation and guilt, satisfying coherence under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the urn fragment and gear act as concrete extensions of her contradictory impulses. The final choice—accepting velvet time—earns its cost through the tactile memory sequence. Minor drift: the elderly woman’s arrival feels slightly external, not fully pressured by the protagonist’s prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"tasted salt and storm," "knees stippled with sand"—but the poet’s contradictory impulses (cling vs release) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the kite-string memory and the spiral’s erasure, with the felt cost of accepting perpetual incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied in every gesture—fingers tracing wire, synchronizing heartbeat with sap—while her contradictory calm under mortality pressure is dramatized through micro-choices that rewire the living temple. The final renunciation (ashes into the circuitry) is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. longing—drives every beat; the amber choice at the summit is earned by prior refusals and embodied cost. Micro-choices (tracing “Converge,” kneeling to the orchid) reveal hierarchy of values. Only the grandmother backstory drifts into summary, not scene, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Coachman’s layered contradictions—former driver of soldiers now ferrying silence, seed-planter who speaks only dead languages—embody both mourning and agency. Interiority is vivid in micro-decisions (kneeling to press ash into the crater, listening to gulls for rain), and his final smile at the blooming battlefield earns its cost against prior grief. Motives remain consistent: bind the dead reef’s memory through the living garden. The earned stasis of remaining “until the last light” without the coach ever leaving the jetty crystallizes the character arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bloodhound’s shift from passive observer to active translator of memory is embodied and earned; the moment he “presses his muzzle against the warm wax seal” crystallizes a cost—acceptance of a world where closeness is auditory, not territorial. Interior contradiction (yearning vs. resignation) is dramatized through scent-memory rather than summary. Grayson functions as pressure, not ornament, forcing the dog’s final stance. The pact remains largely unspoken yet legible in action.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“confusion pooling like ink”), motives (refusal to abandon refugees) drive every beat, and the final renunciation—sketching instead of stepping across—carries visible cost. The compass rose as inherited talisman threads memory and choice, grounding the arc. Minor slip: “blessed pariah” label feels slightly external rather than self-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—honor versus theft, fear versus wonder—play out in the moment he offers his birth-name. The embodied cost is visible when the dawn spills from the lid and he leaps, renouncing the old self. Lira’s sacred playfulness pressures him into the final choice. Only the birth-name reveal feels slightly expository, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is rich—survivor guilt, need to shed masks, and resolve to archive “small gestures” all concrete and embodied. Contradiction surfaces in real time: nostalgia vs ruthless excision of same. Final choice to enact STAY inside the improvised parliament earns its cost: “she no longer knew where she ended and the interregnum began.” Some over-tidy articulation (“theme of smallness”) drags it from 8+. No secondary character on page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the seer's contradictory impulses (to forget vs to speak) are asserted rather than dramatized in real time; the final choice to speak the language feels inevitable yet the cost is more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s guilt and need for atonement are embodied in micro-gestures (drumming openings, chilled ribs) and crystallize in the final seated renunciation. The prodigy’s wordless tipping of the invisible king is a perfect externalization of interior cost. One slip: “productive fidget” edges toward label-speak before it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysandra’s drive is clear and embodied in her choices—e.g., “pressed her charcoal-stained fingers against the pale spire”—but interior tension is stated rather than dramatized (“understood now the price of forgiveness”). The final refrain feels earned yet the moment of internal contradiction remains generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the apprentice’s contradictory impulses—fear of dissolution vs. compulsion to mend—drive every micro-choice. The final acceptance of endless quilting is earned by the prior causal chain of craters and gold. Yet the statue’s agency shift edges toward external rescue, blunting the cost borne solely by the apprentice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Painter’s regret and promise to himself are visceral, embodied in the brushstroke he withholds and the seashell he frees. He pivots from avoidance to acceptance once the oasis shows the betrayal of leaving. Interior contradiction surfaces in the same moment he kneels—enduring horizon theft while surrendering the sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority and embodied choices (pressing palms to stone, uncorking the vial, the final scream) are consistently vivid and specific; her contradiction between wanting to whisper and needing to scream plays out under pressure. The vial cork's dissolution into salt and her collapse against the railing supply a visible cost linked to her motive.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The navigator’s choices pivot every major beat—aligning shards by starlight and pulsing bronze heat—culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses reunion and frames grief as navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—her involuntary honesty vs her self-protective skepticism—is alive in every micro-choice; the glass-eye surrender embodies the earned cost of accepting stewardship, renouncing isolation after line “roots tightened around the glass.” Minor flaw: Dr. Kestrel’s motives remain slightly under-examined.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s contradictory impulses—guard duty vs. memory stewardship—are embodied in micro-choices (kneeling, pacing, pinning the flower). His final renunciation of isolation is earned by the tactile cost of accepting the stranger’s grief. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: the phrase “communal burden” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—promise vs. self-preservation—drives every beat; the final renunciation is earned by the tactile memory of Lila’s choice. Embodied tremor, moss-scent, and the warming chip keep emotion concrete. Micro-choice to pocket the chip and step back crystallizes hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: the cavern closes, path gone forever.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The queen’s interiority is specific—walking the lace of her own unease—and the contradiction between ambition and reconciliation is felt in her chest when she swallows flame; Earned Stasis is viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory desire to bottle time yet yearn for unconfined presence is embodied in micro-choices—aligning the shell, crushing the vial—each with visible cost. Relationship with Cael acts as crucible: the forehead press and final pocketing of the curl crystallize their shared arc. Interiority stays specific, avoiding label-speak; flaws (hubris of bottled suns) complicate the final renunciation. Only the “scientifically romantic” tag edges toward diagnostic shorthand, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vivid embodied interiority ("feral nostalgia clawed at her ribs") sharpens the chronicler's central split; micro-choice—burning the chronicle—earns final cohesion at a tangible cost of lost control and singular identity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertips “humanize” the glass, the screw’s ridges “bloom like dried placenta.” The final micro-choice—placing the screw into the clock—earns a credible shift from sensory absence to synesthetic hearing of scent. One minor slip: the grandmother’s aphorism (“When you lose one sense…”) edges toward folklore convenience rather than lived memory.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—scars crystallizing under stress, the itch of memory—but the final “soft skin” reset feels slightly too neat, muting the cost of transformation. Motivation is clear and embodied; micro-choices (holding breath, tapping quill) reveal hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in the same beat, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“voice roughened by sleepless nights and ether”), motives clear and intensify to the climactic choice; the apology is credibly rooted in prior guilt. The ghost’s pressure forces her to translate metaphor into action, showing contradictory impulses under stress. Cost is felt when she folds the requiem into the ghost’s pocket and walks away without looking back. Minor: archivist’s interiority is absent, but he is a witness, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Witness’s interiority is vivid—cedar/ozone scent, dictionary’s weight loss—but her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. dissolve meaning) are stated more than dramatized. Micro-choices (aligning “unify” with vacuum quill, pressing palm to lectern) are embodied and specific. Final swallow of the dot is a decisive renunciation with felt cost, yet the shift from observer to librarian feels slightly bestowed rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the shepherd’s contradictory impulse—precision vs. longing—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (letting the clock run slow) is earned by the prior discovery that clocks measure longing, and the cost is the silence he will face tomorrow. One hairline slip: “eminently peculiar” is asserted rather than dramatized until the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“felt the entire farm inhale, a vast collective sigh that pulled her grief out through her pores”), but the stranger’s motivation remains opaque, slightly undercutting the relational crucible. The final diffusion is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured—probability equations vs. father-shaped regret—and every bench message forces a micro-choice that escalates toward the roof. The lantern’s weight as “unfinished conversation” is embodied; her laugh “like wet leaves” shows emotion without label. The final renunciation (no more betting her heart) is earned by the breadcrumb trail and costs her the illusion of control.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—cultivating distance yet yearning to connect—drives every micro-choice; the final dissolution is earned because her earlier estrangement tactic is visibly exhausted. Embodied emotion (flicker with the bulb) and the ledger’s blank “Begin” column crystallize cost. Only slight under-dramatized shift from operator to self-subject keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the archivist’s contradictory impulses—grief, duty, longing—co-exist in real time. The final choice to stay and dissolve is earned by the mother’s precedent and the locket’s reweighting. Micro-choices (pressing the petal, capping the pen) reveal value hierarchy. Only the slight abstraction “haunted euphoria” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—logistician’s control vs. desperate surrender—are embodied in the juggling act and the ledger tear. Her micro-choice to relinquish the moon rock crystallizes her arc; the cost is the warm absence in her chest. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, never drifting into label-speak. The fox’s voice carries Mrs. Alder’s timbre, but the POV stays locked to Mara, so relationship pressure is off-page—hence not quite 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"quiet blaze of determination inside her chest warming the night air"—but the final epiphany ("she had been mapping herself all along") arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The interpreter’s contempt for certainty and reflexive edits reveal charged contradiction in scene; her renunciation of the pen and the act of witness anchor a credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—his “soundless laugh that shook his shoulders like a tambourine” shows contradiction between grief and joy. Motivation (translate silence into music) is clear and drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—walking away soaked, footprints fading—earns its cost. Only the “quietly charismatic” label is asserted rather than dramatized, a minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“volcanic tenderness trembling in her chest”), but the shift from arsonist guilt to sacrificial guardian is compressed into a single beat; the curator remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation is clear and stakes escalate, yet the final self-sacrifice feels slightly foregone rather than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradictions bloom through sensory percussion (“tasted someone else’s pearl wedding” vs “keep her own name”), and her renunciation of borrowed memory-ghosts lands with visible cost—her pulse on the rail the next morning. The rebellion is quiet but embodied: every drum tap forecloses one serum slot, and the final smile is the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her neon harness, the coin’s heat on her thigh, the hush between thunder and tide. The micro-choice to shorten her stride to match the guide’s rhythm crystallizes her motive under pressure. The final “remember” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the port city itself becomes her echo chamber. Minor slip: the grandfather backstory is a single cue, not a reflective block, so BRR is met.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The guardian’s silent vow and ritual precision create a credible, embodied interiority; the mirrored child scene crystallizes his cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, yet the final renunciation of speech and mirror feels earned. The flaw—absolute muteness—limits relational crucible but heightens mythic solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (obedience to the library’s hush vs. the urge to act) play out in micro-choices like tracing the grotto rock and slipping diagrams under doors. The final renunciation—teaching the rebellion quietly—earns its cost in the dawn fatigue and the promise of endless tomorrow. One slip: the “unspoken words” trait is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—grace as camouflage vs. grace as weapon—are embodied in every micro-choice; the final dance detaches her from fear with coral anklets as visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. One slip: the ex-pirates’ offer is voiced rather than tested, slightly blunting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The farmer’s interiority—grief muted by mandate—rings embodied and specific; the blank-faced performer’s motives remain opaque, but his micro-choices (whittling, petal placement) enact the stated goal. The cedar heart handed over at the end is a credible Earned Stasis that costs both men their remaining shields. Minor drift: the performer’s “blank face” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Luminous interiority and embodied contradiction (“ink bled upward from the stone”) tether motive to micro-choice; the poet’s shift from trespasser to translator is felt, costly, specific.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—longing for color yet trading memory—are embodied in her tactile sorting of glass and ivy; the final acceptance of blurred edges feels earned because every micro-choice (tucking the reed beneath the leaf, tasting metal) visibly costs her. Calder’s pressure is immediate and status-legible, but his interiority remains opaque, capping the relationship crucible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the bell ringer’s gentle power is dramatized through micro-choices (lifting the cracked lens, tapping the fork). Motivation to “discover the texture of connection” is consistent and intensifies to the final renunciation of departure. The shift from pilgrim to sanctuary is earned, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The maker’s grief is embodied in sustained sensory detail—beads weighting pockets, scent of damp earth, locket she “cannot finish.” The single on-page beat where she kneels and threads jet beads as mulch crystallizes irreversible renunciation: mourning gear re-purposed into garden feed with visible, felt cost. Internal contradiction—still love versus necessity of letting go—remains active until caretaker’s final line. No major slips, yet emotional beats occasionally drift toward poetic summary rather than concrete gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—ink-stained fingers, rain-distorted inches—yet the contradictory impulse (curiosity vs. nostalgia) stays mostly reflective rather than enacted in a decisive beat; the final renunciation (leaving the spiral) is earned but the cost feels lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The historian’s interiority is embodied in the saffron veil and her tactile avoidance of patterns; her contradictory impulse to both resurrect and purify memory crystallizes in the final choice to crack the core. The child-self memory anchors motivation and pays off in the Earned Stasis of irreversible truth. No secondary character pressure, but single-POV depth is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—cataloguer vs. resister—drives every beat; the stone’s pulse and the name-calling climax crystallize her hierarchy of values with embodied cost. The “luminous regret” final stance is earned, not declared. No head-count issues; single-POV discipline holds. Minor: the moment she “understood” is slightly abstract, blunting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling chest, cooled sweat, fierce smile—yet the “shedding layers” metaphor is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the shard yet seeking release—are embodied in the act of re-cutting her own scar; the cost is the final silence of the plants, a felt forfeiture of her lifelong telepathy. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The closure choice is earned by the entire 23-year accumulation of guilt and plant-murmured memory.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior motive—“find where unused love is stored”—serves as constant engine; each micro-choice (threading the film, singing the lost tune, leaving the quartz) springs from that need, culminating in her renunciation of literal pursuit and acceptance of internalised tenderness felt on page. Embodied contradictions (trembling palms, cracked voice) manifest mid-action, never abstract. The cost of no longer following Lin is explicitly paid by walking away from the station a second time, now carrying the melody that had hunted her.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—frost silvering lashes, sextant warming in gloved hands—yet the core contradiction (fear vs. surrender) is stated more than enacted in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the auroral crucible and the brass reflection beat, so the arc lands with cost. Still, a few abstractions (“creativity burst outward, not as fire but as snowfall”) edge toward performed epiphany, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The freight guard’s contradictory impulses—obedience to a vanished archive vs. the need to cultivate its discarded shadows—play out live in micro-choices. His embodied grief is revealed through tactile hallucinations (sand humming in teeth, lullaby shards lodged). Final stance crystallizes: he un-makes the archive to birth forests of erased dreams, accepting the archive’s disappearance as the cost. The memory of rain on absent leaves, gifted then pocketed, anchors the enduring loss beneath his triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the philosopher’s contradictory impulses (cling to identity vs. surrender it) play out in real time. The final renunciation—dissolving name, regrets, city—earns the blank savannah through prior causality and carries visible cost. Micro-choices (choosing DELUSION path, inserting gear) reveal value hierarchy. Only the “wild frontier” refrain edges toward label-speak, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s embodied authority and the boy’s trembling “Stay” crystallize contradictory impulses; the leash and star stamp anchor interior stakes. Yet the guides remain collective archetypes rather than distinct individuals, blurring micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"fingertips still numb," "first sting of returning nerves"—and the bellhop’s contradictory impulses (remain vs. leave) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the bolt’s whisper and the staircase’s bleeding mark, with visible cost: the fortress collapses behind him. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Flawed passivity is credible and complicates the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thimble’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “amber eyes” and “calloused feet” anchor centuries of burden—but the final smile reads slightly abstract, softening the felt cost of justice served.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied in tactile memory (ghost-white reef) and micro-choices (tapping the wall, kneeling to lift the page). Her motivation—discover why routes vanish—drives every beat, culminating in the descent and renunciation of data-logging. The cost is felt: she logs no data, anchoring herself to sky and abyss. One character only; no relationship crucible required.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“toes curling,” “soles tingling”), but the final renunciation—choosing to wait rather than fly—leans on a single beat of reflection rather than a sustained contradiction; still, the cost of remaining a stargazer is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—warrior’s secrecy vs. caretaker’s openness—play out in embodied micro-choices (hiding the bullet, cradling the amber). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits sealed certainty for negotiated destiny. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “destiny is a seed” leans toward label-speak, though it’s embedded in an object.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s embodied trauma and micro-choice to plant the photograph in the olive tree are vivid and earned; the “quiet talent” label is slightly abstract but her somatic markers ground it. Interior contradiction—grief beside hope—plays out in real time. Cost is felt when she re-folds the photo along new lines, foreclosing denial.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—painting memory while fearing erasure—drives every beat; her micro-choice to weave memory-threads into a new floor pattern visibly costs her blank self-portrait and anchors the ending. Embodied ache (“salt water kissed her ankles”) keeps emotion off the therapist’s couch. The final acceptance is earned by prior causality: only after she re-stitches reality can the walls retreat. Flaw: the keeper’s skeleton feels observed more than interacted with, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alba’s serene anger is embodied and consistent, driving every micro-choice; her immunity to panic and refusal to flee are credibly rooted in her physiology and seventeen-year history. The final decision to step through the doorway is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost—she forfeits safety to rescue the others. Interiority is specific and character-bound, avoiding diagnostic speak. Only the chronographer’s late appearance limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tatiana’s contradictory impulses—duty vs love—are embodied in the violet fingertips and deliberate heartbeat; the final act of broadcast is earned by prior stealth and carries visible social cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “bravely conflicted” is once label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s pacifist stance and continuity drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices (burying canvas, grafting cuttings) that foreclose violence; the final gift of the rose is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory—she both fears and understands her father’s possible arrival. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“continuity was not the same as loyalty”) that slightly blurs the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s cool-headedness is embodied in her deliberate zigzag path and calm heartbeat; the surrender of that trait to house the goddess’s echo is dramatized through the rail-spike bargain and her final burning resonance. Interiority stays concrete—salt ache, net patience—without diagnostic labels. The cost is felt: she forfeits the very trait that defined her. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Octavia’s contradictory impulses—obsession with legacy vs. need to erase it—are embodied in micro-choices (adjusting telescope, tasting meteorite ink). The final renunciation of the nib lands with visible cost, though the journalist’s presence dilutes interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tattooist’s guilt is embodied in the looping cry and the amber pulse; her choice to tattoo her throat is a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete (“guilt shrink to the size of a freckle”), though a touch of diagnostic self-awareness creeps in. Motivation stays consistent, and the final quieting of the cry feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the artist’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remember yet choosing release—play out in micro-choices (widening the ring, pocketing flake and nub). Motivation stays rooted in her perceptual stance and culminates in an earned renunciation with visible cost: she accepts the silence and leaves the mandala behind.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Azim’s interiority is textured and embodied; the retrocognitive flash anchors motive. Leylah’s presence supplies relational pressure, but her arc is under-sketched. The final act of pressing the tessera is earned and costly, yet Azim’s “gentle radical” identity is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ghost’s bow-craving interiority is vivid but the only micro-choice—dancing while gathering memory-ovations—reads as external orchestration rather than character-driven. No interior contradiction or genuine flaw shapes the climax; her fusion with dust feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s contradictory imperatives—preserving versus releasing the unknown—are embodied in the fossil’s final fusion; renunciation feels earned. Interiority remains character-specific (sensor trembles, not abstract labels) and flaws (her passivity at threshold) compel the ending. The visible cost—she is mapped in gold and left voiceless yet responsible—scales to micro-fiction and resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hourglass turner’s interiority is embodied and specific; contradictions surface in her quiet awe versus urgent task. Micro-choices—selecting buttons, pressing the seed pearl—reveal value hierarchy and cost. Final renunciation (leaving jar open, scattering buttons) is earned by prior causality with visible emotional price. Slight reserve: no secondary character on page limits relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“unused courage…slow ember he had banked”), but the final reconciliation with Mara feels slightly under-motivated; her trust pivot is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Coachman's grief is embodied in every oar-stroke; the palimpsest promise is a lived contradiction that forces the final surrender of memory. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the micro-choice to hand over the smile is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kiran’s interiority is embodied and specific—his palms open to the thrum, his choice to weight the blooming footstep—but the final renunciation (“continuous, careful turning”) is more asserted than dramatized with visible cost. The contradiction between stillness and motion is present yet not fully mined for tension. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her knees creak, her throat tightens, her palms cup a match-flame of hope. The contradictory impulses (pragmatism vs. wistful planting) are dramatized in the moment she whispers “Not yet,” choosing to shield rather than smother the green bead. The final touch of the gauge tooth against the bud crystallizes her stance with visible cost: she has foreclosed sleep and risked heartbreak to keep the rose’s song alive.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her aching joints, the taste of ozone, the copper-rain chord—yet the final leap off the balcony feels slightly under-motivated; the brass whale’s promise of “possible futures” is abstract, not a concrete cost that forces the choice. Still, her contradictory impulses (cling to memory vs. release it) play out in scene, and the renunciation of the library is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arin’s interiority bristles with contradictions—her desire to offload secrets while hoarding them on her person—and embodied choices (offering the twig, stepping into the prismatic hush) drive every beat; her final release is both earned reconfiguration and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—fear vs. hope—drives every micro-choice; the trembling finger on the chart, the sweat-slick fader, the marker equations all embody stakes. Mentor’s last words anchor motive without backstory bloat. Final renunciation (leaving transmitter running) costs her vulnerability to future retaliation—earned, visible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in micro-choices (counting steps, mapping exits) and collide with her need to reach the organ; the fused key and final “I’ll map the sky for you” crystallize earned change with visible cost—her mother’s ghost released and her own fear unhooked. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. One slip: the phrase “spatial mutiny” is diagnostic shorthand rather than embodied perception, a hairline nick.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s face-blindness and methodical numbering of brushstrokes embody interior contradiction; the ribbon reunion forces a micro-choice that visibly costs him his anonymity and detachment. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The final handing-over of the canvas is an earned renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s “nervously confident” refrain is embodied in trembling fingers yet sure drawer-shuts; the copper nail warms, anchoring ancestral dread in her palm. The final substitution beats—stepping aside yet keeping the blunted nail—crystallize a hierarchy of values (lineage over self-preservation) with visible cost. Interior contradiction is sustained: she wants rescue but accepts exile, shown not told. Only the ancestor’s silent question leans on label-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fiddler’s interiority is embodied and specific—her noticing scaffold-wrap Morse, the flake vibrating against wood—yet the “never” she renounces remains abstract; her final step onto the bridge earns the change but the cost is more luminous than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic caretaker vs. time-robber—surface in embodied micro-choices (folding peso into boat, lighting euro). Interiority is specific, but the father-robber lineage is asserted more than dramatized, softening the final renunciation’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fear of emptied dreams and her healing-by-witnessing both manifest in concrete micro-choices (aligning the telegram, naming the drowned). Corin’s grief is embodied in his trembling finger and unguarded smile, but his arc is slightly less textured. The final renunciation (offering guilt and fear) is earned and costly, though Corin’s offering feels briefly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"frost-numbed fingers," "taste of her own unspoken truth"—but the conjurer’s resurrection feels slightly under-motivated; his return is granted rather than earned by her micro-choices. The druid’s contradictory impulses (guard vs. confession) drive every beat, culminating in the thorn-pierced feeding of the plant. Cost is visible: blood, confession, and the plant’s death. Still, the conjurer’s solidity is more gift than consequence, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. memory-loss—are dramatized in the seed-offering beat; the cost (surrendered dreams) is embodied in the wrist-scar reconfiguration. Interiority is specific, but “anxious elation” recurs as label-speak, blunting peak emotion. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—reckless grafting vs. fierce gentleness—are dramatized in every beat; the final choice to stay and become root-memory is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (her foreclosed futures). Interiority is embodied (sap “like blood,” warm bark) rather than labeled. Status shift with Ardan is subtle but legible. No slips touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elliot’s interiority is textured and embodied—gut twisting, cloth pressed to chest—but “confidently uncertain” is declared rather than dramatized. The final micro-choice (cloth in pocket, search for singer’s sister) is earned, carries visible cost, and grows from prior grief.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s interiority is precise and embodied—her boots stick, her palm tingles, her whispered line carries the weight of ten years. The haunted ambitions are shown thinning “like morning fog,” a concrete micro-choice that reweights her motive. The final refusal to pick the fruit is earned by the seed’s root asking permission, crystallizing her arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The librarian-figure is vividly embodied—brass exoskeleton clicking, creel rustling—but the causal path linking her two migratory identities to the final choice is mostly image-driven; we witness the layering of contradictions rather than a single motivated decision. Emotions are sensory-anchored (“brass joints singing”), avoiding abstraction, and the cost of carrying the burning furnace is felt but articulated via imagery rather than explicit internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—sealer of vaults vs. dissolver of walls—is embodied in the warming pearl and etched confessions; the final abdication carries visible cost as she steps barefoot into grass, crownless. Interiority stays concrete, but the “reluctant monarch of silence” phrase edges toward label-speak, blunting the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—river vs. medication—drives every micro-choice; the accordion as confessional tool embodies guilt and agency. The final renunciation (tearing the map, leaving the station) is earned by the embodied cost of speaking her name aloud. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    The veiled dreamer's inner contradiction—hunger to hear her mother's lullaby vs. dread of the price—grounds every beat. Her choice to trade the moment she first believed is embodied, trembling, and visibly costs the confidence man's signature. The veil’s loss and cracked watch register as irreversible external stakes. However, her interiority is occasionally too cleanly explanatory (“understood her role”), blunting the raw struggle at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—preserve vs. thaw—are embodied in micro-choices (touching the seed, bowing the violin) that foreclose the empire’s offer; the felt cost is the caged future she refuses. Interiority is concrete and plant-telepathy is never therapy-speak. Only the grandmother backstory drifts into summary without altering present tactics, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mortician’s contradictory impulse—clinging to the sparks of the dead while yearning for release—plays out in embodied micro-choices (pressing the chip, releasing it). The final renunciation carries visible cost: her empty palms and the map of faces etched in air. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no therapy-speak intrudes. The smile at the end is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific; the antique hairpin anchors her contradictory impulses (guilt vs. caretaker oath). The final choice to guide her sister home is earned by the ghost-mother beat and costs her the heirloom. Minor slip: “kindly decisive” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—mercy vs betrayal, certainty vs nuance—are dramatized in real time through micro-choices (testing the cloak, handing over the shard). The final compromise is earned by prior interior struggle and carries visible cost: the cloak’s new weight of shared grief. Minor slip: “conscience for hire” is asserted rather than shown in prior jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara-Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between teaching presence while practicing absence is dramatized in the trance. Micro-choice—releasing the stone only after the last ring kisses shore—earns the final vanishing with visible cost. The backwards-aging trait is more label than lived experience, slightly blunting the flaw’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"pulse left wandering through her ribs"—but the character’s choices are largely symbolic rather than concrete, softening the arc. The final transformation is earned by the accumulative pattern rather than a single decisive act, so the cost feels diffuse. Still, the voice is distinct and the emotional stakes are palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—his contradictory impulses (yearning vs. failure) are embodied in the keystone and the act of unstrapping crampons. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the keystone becomes “nothing more than stone.”

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miren’s interior contradiction—ritual precision versus emotional need—drives every micro-choice; the filed key tag embodies her vow and forces tactile decisions. The final renunciation (letting the tag sink) costs her the tool that defined her nights, earned by the library’s revelation. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority crystallizes under pressure; “quietly enthusiastic” re-energizes during the coin-circle moment, grounding her final decision. The coins weight = heartbeat crystallizes the felt cost of acceptance. Minor slip is the backward-prophecy echo feels briefly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The reaper’s interior contradiction—wanting to forget yet compelled to remember—drives every beat; the crystallized names literally refill his hollow ribs, a visceral cost. His micro-choice to press the atlas to his chest seals the arc with earned stasis. Backstory is woven through present-tense cues (wax cylinder, prism shards) that tilt his stance without summary drift. The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority and micro-choices track character conflict despite sparse dialogue; Calen’s decision to trade the bell-first loyalty is made breathably specific, though his flaw compound feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lila’s interior contradiction—guilt versus duty—drives every beat; her micro-choice to lay the father-boot photo at the mirror crystallizes the arc with visible emotional cost. Embodied emotion (“wet with lake spray”) avoids label-speak. The final renunciation of sole guardianship is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of solitary silence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her loosened hair, the tear that crystallizes—yet the final dissolution is slightly too lyrical to feel like earned cost; the alchemist’s contradictory impulses (rigor vs. wonder) are dramatized in scene, not stated, and the renunciation of self carries visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zev’s embodied vigilance and tactile memory anchor every beat; the micro-choice to re-weave the release sequence crystallizes his arc. Interior contradiction—pride in past fix vs dread of future failure—drives the scene. Cost is palpable in raw palms and the moonlit dummy. Only the rookie anecdote drifts into summary, blunting the flaw’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the numbness vs. thaw is visceral. The twin Kaels’ contradictory impulses—ownership vs. surrender—play out in real time on the tatami. The final co-stewardship choice is earned by the shared admission of numbness and the cost of re-sensitization.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—guard vs. evolve—are embodied in micro-choices (locking the seed, nightly vigils, whispering “Grow”). Her final surrender of proprietorship is earned by the corpse-flower’s living blueprint and her felt fear-to-tenderness shift. Interiority is concrete, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“understand then that…”) keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to reanimate laughter—are embodied in every micro-choice (grip on cord, throttle modulation). The final smile is earned by the causal chain of her risky séance with the blower. Interiority stays concrete and idiosyncratic; no therapy-speak intrudes. Minor cap: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible is moot.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motives remain abstract—the guardian simply “waits” and “practices.” The acolyte’s return offers a late emotional beat, yet his transformation feels narrated rather than earned through visible interior struggle. No contradictory impulses act in-scene; the guardian’s interiority stays lyrical rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s stoic sensitivity and heretical resolve drive every micro-choice. The final surrender of blood and memory feels earned, with visible cost (bleeding palm, emptied past). Minor drift: “hopeless” label is asserted early but not dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s grief-driven quest is embodied in concrete micro-choices (climbing, tuning by shedding assumptions, tucking the sphere over his heart). The interior contradiction—yearning to replay death yet accepting its echo—culminates in earned stasis when he walks away vibrating with the next story. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cass’s resilient positivity is embodied in micro-choices (polishing rail, steady radio voice) and charged by the cost of eternal guardianship; the hourglass’s sideways sand literalizes her internal contradiction. Motivation to merge timelines is declared early and paid for in the final image of the ghost timetable only she sees. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—palms tingling with “rational enchantment,” the lullaby memory folding fear like paper—but the final surrender reads slightly abstract; the cost is felt more as concept than embodied consequence, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; grief as pressure is palpable. The anchor link’s evolving meaning charts a credible arc from memento to compass. Final choice to dive and teach carries visible cost—she leaves the known grid forever. Only minor: wife’s voice is reported, not dramatized, so relationship crucible is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s curiosity and reluctant heroism are embodied through tactile micro-choices (adjusting the hearing-aid dial, kneeling, repeating names aloud). The contradictory pull between mapping grief and becoming a conduit for the dead is dramatized in-scene; the final vow carries visible cost. Minor slip: “incidental heroism” is named rather than fully enacted, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is embodied in metallic groans and pulse-counting; her micro-choice to sing the binary lullaby crystallizes her shift from escape to stewardship. The gold fleck’s warmth in her palm at the end shows earned cost. Interiority stays specific, though “fierce tenderness” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—heartbeat counting, ink on skin—but the “ghost in the wires” premise is asserted more than dramatized; the final fusion with the dome earns the change yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single POV delivers embodied interiority and micro-choices (naming textures, lifting arms) that escalate under pressure; copper veins hardening into grammar-map is earned cost. Motivation rooted in childhood keeps stakes personal; final renunciation of ancestral resonance carries visible price. No contradictory impulses on-page, but interiority is more lyrical than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vale’s contradictory impulses—grief for Orion vs. scientific detachment—are embodied in the arrowhead and crystallize when she chooses to become the cosmic joke; the cost is her lost humanity. Interiority is specific, embodied, and escalates under pressure. Minor slip: Orion’s off-page status weakens relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Violinist’s contradictory impulses—fear vs. duty to reawaken beauty—are embodied in micro-choices (pressing shell to pulse, funneling fear into the final note). Interiority is concrete, but the teacher’s vanishing is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly blunting motivation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Six’s interiority is vivid—storm bottle pulses against ribs, copper token warmth merging with heartbeat—yet the “respectfully rebellious” label is asserted more than embodied; Lila’s barefoot postcard moment crystallizes shared orphaning of trust, but her agency is off-stage after the hatch.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carpenter’s interiority is embodied in tactile sanding, pocketing the halo, and the first sung note; his contradictory silence vs. song drives every beat. The final renunciation—stepping onto the swan while mouthing unheard words—earns the cost of permanent voicelessness. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mireille’s eccentric gait, scarf-guided obedience, and final smile embody a coherent, if lightly sketched, interiority; the micro-choice to shelve the copper book after reawakening stories shows a cost (bearing their weight) that earns her quiet guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The librarian’s contradictory impulse—yearning to possess the dream yet gifting the palette—drives the final renunciation; the embodied cost (shadowless exile) is legible and scaled to the piece. Interiority remains concrete and character-specific, though a touch more micro-choice under pressure would lift it to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his ribs fluttering with trapped melody, the scent of cedar and thunderstorm on the ribbon—but the final exchange with Aelira is slightly too tidy, muting the cost of his seven-year quest. His contradictory impulse (to free the idea yet fear its release) is dramatized in the disorientation beat, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “chronically curious” trait drives every micro-choice, from prying shards to pressing the scarred mushroom. The contradiction between her hunger for knowledge and the cost of lost years is embodied, not labeled. The final renunciation—leaving the shard—earns its poignancy because we have felt the weight of the returned years settle “heavier now.” Only the mother’s voice remains slightly abstract, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs. exile, tenderness vs. combat—are embodied in her backward steps and the trembling glass; the final choice to drink reverses exile with visible cost (loss of ghost-weight). Interiority is concrete, but the younger self remains more symbol than autonomous character, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s interior contradiction—joy in surplus vision curdling into fear of loss—drives every beat; the marrow-cost is embodied in silvering hands and accepted in a final micro-choice (knife planted blade-down). Motivation stays rooted in the creative trait and escalates to sacrificial graft. Minor slip: “insatiably creative” is stated more than dramatized in early lines.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her breath frosting, ribs pressed by silence—yet her contradictory impulse (absorbing grief vs. releasing it) is dramatized only in the final third. The earned renunciation of carrying new silences is credible, but the micro-choice hierarchy could be sharper earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shielded openness” and tactile curiosity drive every beat. The moment she presses the torn map to the wall is a micro-choice that crystallizes her arc and costs her certainty. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate stays closed.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressure mirrors the one pressing against my ribs”), but the protagonist’s analytic stance keeps emotion at a cool distance; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—silence vs. song—is embodied in the spectral child and the bolt plate; her micro-choices (painting the door, following the ghost) enact a credible renunciation of muteness with felt cost. The ghost-child’s plea “I was the song you stopped singing” crystallizes the internal conflict without therapy-speak. Motives remain character-bound; no knowledge leaps. The final silence “full instead of empty” earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs. preservation of memory—are embodied in micro-choices (catching the goggles “softly,” fitting them to her own eyes). The final gesture of placing them on the captain earns the shift from servant to co-witness of reclaimed flight, with visible cost in her relinquishing control of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—guilt for Dr. Vasquez threads every cloud choice, and her final embrace of mnemonic weather-logging is earned; flaw, motive and on-page cost coalesce. Minor therapy-speak once (“carry the weight of grief”) stops short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira’s face-blindness, micro-choices, and embodied hesitation at the coin create an interior spiral that justifies every pigment and star; her final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible conceptual cost as the mural fractures into seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing chalk, pressing the warm square—that escalate to irreversible commitment; the final whispered line crystallizes her cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “oddly stranded” abstracts what the body already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the locksmith’s contradictory impulses—fix the world yet accept personal erasure—are dramatized in the final fusion. Motivation is rooted in childhood loss and sustained through tactile micro-choices. The cost is palpable when the brass key fuses to her skin, foreclosing escape. One notch below 9.0 only because the “rhythm of repair” refrain edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Luma’s altruism is embodied in every spectral gesture; Kiran’s arc from machine-raised orphan to orchard-keeper is dramatized through micro-choices (tracing chalk, lifting the bell). Interiority is sparse but character-specific, and the final renunciation—Luma dissolving into perpetual dew—carries visible cost. Minor: the mechanic, twins, and archivist are sketched more as functions than individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interior contradiction—wanting to save yet forced to erase—drives every beat; the climactic self-emptying (“pane dissolved into her bloodstream”) costs her voice and future agency, grounding the lyrical arc in embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nadia’s reluctant caretaker role is embodied in micro-choices—crouching under the limb, cracking the nut, guiding with silence—each revealing layered motives. Interiority is concrete and contradictory: duty to the orchard vs. need to escape. The final renunciation (walking away without touching) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary characters (hikers) remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The polymerist’s interior contradiction—science vs guilt—remains embodied on every beat, culminating in the micro-choke when she decides to bind resin to stone; that choice costs the option of total erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vendor’s interiority is vivid and embodied—counting absences, feeling the bottle tug—but the motivation to “serve stories” is stated rather than dramatized; the final renunciation of the vendor role earns a credible stasis yet lacks prior stakes to make the cost sting.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s interiority is precise—tasting remorse, holding it “like a too-hot spoonful”—but reliance on lyrical summary in lieu of dramatized impulse makes the final ingestion read more ritualistic than struggled. Slight over-calibration smooths the cost of bearing the lord’s grief, blunting the flaw-driven tension that would push this to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sora’s interiority is vivid—her empathy is embodied in tactile handling of the cuckoo weight and in the polyglot lullabies she sings to iron and seed. The decisive act of pressing the weight into the silo seam is earned by prior care and carries visible cost (rust, isolation confessed). Minor slip: “empathetically decisive” is once label-speak, not dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"cold glass bite into skin"—but the engineer’s contradictory impulses remain mostly aligned; no moment where one desire visibly collides with another. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she walks away carrying the mirror whose cracks now map her neural re-wiring, so the change is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s singular, prism-minded drive is embodied in every micro-choice; the moment she presses the seed into mercury and accepts the dragon into her own thoughts crystallizes an earned cost. Interior contradiction is implied but not fully dramatized in scene, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“throat aches with borrowed sorrow”), but the sculptor’s contradictory impulses remain largely implied rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat; the final renunciation of force in favor of invitation is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied; the dented stone anchors contradictory impulses (shame vs. hope) that crystallize in the final placement of the knight. The keeper’s brief appearance supplies relational pressure that reframes exile as preparation, forcing a visible stance shift. Cost is felt when the dent deepens—an earned, tactile price. Minor slip: the prince’s failure is summarized, not dramatized, slightly blunting motivational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s pacifist identity drives every significant micro-choice and the final renunciation of violence is embodied in her literal touch on the blank page—earned and costed by prior causality. Internal contradiction (near-strike memory) is dramatized in real time, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ari’s sensory gift and ambition are embodied in every micro-choice; the seed’s handling, the doodle-journal, and the nightly rituals all spring from her trait-driven motive. Interiority is vivid (“taste every petal…”) and her final realization—story over soil—earns the closure with visible cost (tearing the petal). The only minor slip is the grandmother’s warning delivered as summary rather than embodied memory.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse surfacing “like distant surf” under the whirling silence. The arrow-tip memory flash is a sharp micro-choice that re-weights her motive from data-gathering to stewardship. The final pocketing of the tip and the smile of recognition show earned endurance with visible cost. One minor slip: “memorial, each tree fed…” drifts toward label-speak, blunting the embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The investigator’s interiority is spare but embodied—her gait adjusts to the shifting maze, her fingers release silk to map breath. Motivation (“cultivate foresight”) is dramatized when she volunteers to tend the sphere, trading places with Mara at visible cost. The patch’s return as a “badge of borrowed duty” crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses retreat. Minor: we never feel her flaws or limits; she adapts too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; synesthetic perception drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—releasing her guarded silence—carries a felt cost that forecloses her path. Motivation (“to certify wonder as essential”) is dramatized through tactile action rather than stated. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulses—clinging vs. letting go—are dramatized through the spiral of driftwood and the flute fracture. Motivation is rooted in past failure yet evolves in-scene toward a new stance. The final renunciation of “wall” for “song” carries visible cost: the guardianship scar and the fracture acknowledgment. Minor slip: “avalanchingly quiet” repeats without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—she both clings to and doubts the borrowed astronomer persona; embodied micro-choices (locking reversed type, pressing halo to heart) reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation to “solve emotion” is dramatized through tactile risk, not label. Final renunciation of borrowed identity carries visible cost: halo cracks, workshop dissolves, leaving unborrowed uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s courier identity and jittery reflexes are embodied in every flick of the pendant and click of her knees; the final choice to pass the pendant onward rather than surrender it crystallizes her shift from anonymity to myth-bearer with visible cost—she forfeits her mentor-shaped safety. Interior contradiction pulses in the tension between practiced lies and the craving for wonder. The only cap is that the mentor’s absence is more asserted than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's arc is specific—vision of driver’s fear refracted through prism redefines her hypothesis—but interior voice occasionally slips into lyrical exposition rather than prising open contradiction under visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her tactile grief, the swallowed thorn, the pulse of the bead against her breast. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (selling the loom, kneeling at the basin, pressing the bead into the puzzle). The final renunciation—accepting one-way hope—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “stoically sparkling tears” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interior contradiction—clinging to grief yet forging lattices—drives every beat; the memory-for-strength trade is embodied in the wrist-tightening silk and the hollow after the azure exchange. Her quiet determination is dramatized, not labeled, when she lights the cold forge. The final recognition that memory is “alloyed, not erased” lands as earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—cartographer vs. pilot—drives every beat; the shard’s pulse forces micro-choices that escalate cost. Embodied emotion (“tears freezing”) and the final renunciation (pressing the shard into the floor) earn the change. Minor: younger-Lira beat is summary, not dramatized, slightly diluting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence and embodied vigilance are vivid; the contradictory pull between stoic duty and the ache to “bottle the balm” drives every micro-choice. The final sealing of the flask crystallizes a renunciation with felt cost. Minor: the widow’s pressure is more spectral suggestion than crucible, so relationship dynamics stay thin.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—laughter as both joy and weapon—are embodied in every micro-choice (trimming wick, spinning mirrors). Motivation is consistent and intensifies toward the climactic release of the storm. The final renunciation of human form carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s permeability arc is embodied in the heart-sync moment; the final vow carries earned cost. Interiority is vivid, but the “second sun” cliché and one stock phrase (“quietly explosive”) keep it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulse—measuring grief while seeking living witness—drives every beat; her tactile handling of the sextant and the oak root anchors interiority. The final reassembly is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she forfeits the original instrument for a new tool of witness. No stock interiority; each micro-choice (tracing fracture lines, pressing the wall) reveals hierarchy of values. Character remains flawed and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—“pulse of a heart that was not hers” grounds empathy in tactile contact. Motivation (save the orchard) is clear, but the final scattering of her own memories feels slightly under-motivated; we don’t feel the cost to her identity until the last sentence. Micro-choices (kneeling, tying the blossom) reveal hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so 9+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her shift from outward compassion to inward mercy is dramatized through the mirrored books and the self-shelving volume. The final renunciation (writing an invitation to no one) costs her the map she once fled along, earning closure. One minor slip: “compassionate recluse” risks label-speak early, but the scene quickly grounds it in sensory choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific; the noticer’s catalogue of vanishings grounds her vigilance. Emotional cost is embodied—“her spine rigid”—while contradiction surfaces in her wish to uncloak. Renunciation is enacted through planting; the cost of letting memory dilute into seed is palpable. Dialogue convergences are minimal and voice stays coherent; no label-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her trembling fingers, crystallized veins, and the lantern’s warmth spreading through her arm embody the stakes. The contradiction between her duty to preserve and her vow to release is dramatized in the moment she opens the window. The cost of letting her own vow melt into her skin is visible and irreversible. Minor slip: “gently meticulous” is repeated as label rather than enacted in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—familial loyalty versus undercover betrayal—drives every micro-choice; the erased recording is a credible Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (tasting wind, metal memory) and motives clear, but the skeptic’s shift to “no longer a skeptic” feels compressed; more contradiction in-scene would raise this. Embodied emotion (ring warming, taste of bergamot) supports character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the charcoal artist’s contradictory impulses (flight vs return) are dramatized through tactile micro-choices. The final renunciation—wearing the lock as locket—earns its cost via the mother-memory sequence. Minor slip: “auroral sorrow” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysandra’s interior contradiction—truth-telling vs. self-protection—drives every beat; the moment she speaks her withheld apologies to the vapor, the cost (loss of safe silence) is embodied in the brightening mist. Micro-choices (pocketing the postal plate, planting vials) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible stakes. The shift from gilded ink to plain rice paper crystallizes earned change. Minor slip: the “brother’s last letter dissolved unanswered” is summary, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mute bell-tuner's interior contradictions—silent voice yet wide ears, need to preserve wonder while destroying its source—act in every beat; his final bow acknowledges mutual vulnerability between maker and made. Embodied shame and joy appear in frost-rimmed lashes, palms open, heartbeat-like tear. Micro-choice to offer bronze petals directly alters the orb's fate and costs him his last material buffer. Silence deepens into earned renunciation: he carries wonder's seed but no spoken word ever.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lumen's contradiction between machine coding and learned longing is dramatized in micro-choices—pouring childhood fears into the trough, cupping the transferred flame, sealing the beads against his chest—each action showing an embodied cost; the final renunciation carries the visible price of powering down into "quiet listening" that forecloses escape.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “listening” gift is embodied in tactile beats (keys on fountain, palm on mailbox). The final act of hanging the locket is earned by her prior micro-choices and carries visible communal cost. One minor slip: the phrase “pulse felt urgent” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra's embodied choreography, bodily micro-choices, and encrypted motivation hold across every beat; cost is felt in the bite of shard on sternum. Her contradiction—stealing to liberate—stays etched in silence rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s longing for erased memories is embodied—knees buckling under heavier gravity—yet her interiority drifts into “a blade behind her ribs,” edging on stock. The final gesture of tasting lemon-memory feels earned because it literalizes the mother-presence and costs her the comfort of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“quiet heat became a tranquil blaze inside her chest”), but the summoner’s contradictory impulses—silence the world vs. listen to it—are stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The earned shift from silencer to listener is credible and carries felt cost, yet the micro-choices leading up to it are generalized rather than specific to her.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority blooms in concrete threads: the unnamed narrator’s guilt-laced curiosity about the ghost mail anchors every escalating choice. Flaws—courtship hesitancy, architectural longing—compound into real stakes. The final acceptance of the seal’s weight proves earned and irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—clinging to memory while fearing its loss—drive every beat. The final gesture of cupping the shell mirrors her mother’s and crystallizes her earned independence with visible cost. Minor slip: “charmed skeptic” is asserted rather than dramatized early on.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. survival—are embodied in the thorn’s dual role as weapon and pen; her final micro-choice to bleed onto the treaty is earned by seventeen years of forged signatures and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The renunciation of forgery is a credible Earned Stasis that forecloses her former life.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is richly textured and embodied; the grief-tuned “antenna” conceit is character-specific. The final choice—to preserve rather than silence the echoes—carries visible cost in the stranger’s dissolution and the singer’s solitude. Motivation remains consistent yet deepens through progressive disclosure. Only the stranger’s late arrival keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nadia's emotional interiority—"wreckage of her own mind," "salt-stiff hair"—is embodied and specific, yet her contradictory impulses (cling vs release) are only implied. Her micro-choice—breathing on the globe—catalyzes a cascade, but the leap from salvaging a childhood desire to ghost-collector ethics feels lightly driven by prior material. Backstory/Reflection stays within the 20 % cap and lands via the final rescue; still, her flaw (obsessive collection) is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The net-mender philosopher’s quiet rebellion against decay is compelling, but her interior monologue drifts from concrete action into lyric abstraction in key beats; a sharper micro-choice under pressure would lock her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s contradictory impulses—truth-seeker vs. protector of fragile peace—are embodied in the moment she folds the compass into the Apple and replants it. The interiority is specific, never diagnostic; her heartbeat registering with the orchard is a lived, bodily cost. The final renunciation is earned: her father’s letter predicts her arrival, so silence is both betrayal and mercy. Only the courier’s death feels slightly external, not fully filtered through her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cassia’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her solder-burned sleeves, her ear pressed to ozone—but the shift from lone visionary to communal prophet happens off-stage; the congregation’s arrival dilutes the cost of her final choice, keeping her just shy of a fully earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The penny poet’s interiority is vivid—his contradictory impulse to hoard yet release memory is embodied in the act of sealing and uncorking jars. Micro-choices (winding the box, whispering “Stay”) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—leaving the loft lighter—earns its cost through the prior accumulation of captured sound. Only the backstory about the deaf woman in Marseilles feels slightly grafted, not fully digested into present motive.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—logic vs. heart—drives every beat; the key hand-off and final “Rest” crystallize her arc with felt cost. Motivation stays rooted in protecting the artifact and is tested by the sonic ritual. Minor: the crypt keeper remains more emblem than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s drive, interior friction, and embodied choices feel vivid; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the elders and children remain off-stage sketches rather than crucible, slightly diluting relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between Kellerman’s detachment and her growing entanglement is dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling, striking the match, speaking aloud). The final renunciation—choosing resistance over data—earns its cost by the father’s revealed sacrifice. Minor slip: “watchfully calm” is repeated as label rather than embodied in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s guilt and Elias’s refusal collide in embodied micro-choices (handing over the heart, the wrist-grab), but the chaplain’s interiority flirts with therapeutic summary (“people deserve more than wind”). The cost is felt—Rowan leaves the heart behind—yet Elias’s turn feels slightly under-motivated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ludo’s yearning algorithm is an embodied, contradictory pulse that steers micro-choices (spiraling to slice clouds into music, striking silence for resonance). Flaw-curiosity propels visible risk; final silence-with-cost earns. Orrin’s hunter voice remains consistent pressure, but his interiority stays surface-true: functional yet not deeply mined.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her heartbeat syncing to “117” crystallizes her stakes. The choice to lie and smuggle the patch is earned by prior grief and the discovered betrayal. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she understood then…”) that slightly blunts the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“taste emotions the way others tasted salt”—and her micro-choices (angling mirrors, tilting fragment) visibly reweave relations. The final acceptance carries cost: the fragment dulls, treaty germinates in winter soil. Minor slip: “calmly intuitive” flirts with label-speak but is immediately dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet staying to listen—are embodied in micro-choices (offering the parasol, trawling darkness). The final renunciation to “stay and listen” is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost: she shoulders the labor of endless storms. Interiority is concrete, e.g., “fold in patience…inside her ribs.”

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is character-specific (sentinel noticing vines’ slowed sap), emotions embodied in taste/smell. One flaw: the “passionate subtlety” ending smile feels authorial label rather than earned. Otherwise single POV holds throughout, contradiction between holding on and letting felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The walker’s shift from mourning to stewardship is embodied in the glove-removal and pulse-counting beat; interiority is specific, but the monks remain off-page furniture, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation (preserve the echo) is clear and drives every beat; the cost—surrendering control—is dramatized in the silent shard distribution. No stock phrasing; emotions are tactile (salt on lashes, warm hinge). Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: diagonal line → clearing → shard offering.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Archivist’s interiority is rich—her “perceptively calm gaze” and tactile ritual with the child’s photograph embody motive—but the arrival of secondary characters dilutes her agency; the final renunciation (emptying the case) is earned yet shared with the collective, softening individual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scholar’s interiority is textured—his shift from decoding to surrender is embodied in the tactile handling of crystals and the single spoken word “Mother.” Yet the arc is more revelation than choice; the decisive renunciation (leaving the library) feels lightly motivated, reducing the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Precisely drawn prophet whose precognitive forgetfulness becomes causal engine: it forces each morning search and the spiral ritual, which drives the climax. Interior contradiction is embodied, not described; the cost is the tide of erased memories pressing against him. Concrete embodied flaw justifies every choice, leading to Earned Stasis in the pearl of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s internal arc is coherent: the impulse to “repair” becomes the acceptance of impermanence with visible cost (the empty film canister). Interiority is sensuous—trembling fingers, luminous ache—rather than diagnostic. Micro-choices (not stopping the hand but tilting the lens) tether motives to action and foreclose the former goal. The emotional contradiction is embodied early and paid later, satisfying the earned-cost clause.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied in tactile choices—pressing vinyl to wrist, fitting shards—showing decisive kindness under pressure. The contradiction between clinical detachment and emotional investment is dramatized through micro-choices, culminating in the costly act of completing the circle with her own pulse. No stock phrasing; every beat advances motive. The final renunciation (letting the record rest in dawn) is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning for reunion vs. fear of the cost—surface in micro-choices (pressing the sundial, inserting the spoon). The final merger with the silhouette is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slippage: “quietly deliberate” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivy’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. yearning to believe—are dramatized in the garden when she presses the tooth into the skeleton’s hand; the embodied cost is the widening “cleft in certainty.” Micro-choices (pocketing the tooth, humming the lullaby) reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—handing the opalescent tooth back—earns its poignancy through prior causal beats. Only a slight over-articulation of “turning mistakes into constellations” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—embodied trembling, salt taste, memory flashes that tilt her present tactics. The polishing micro-choice sequence reveals a hierarchy of values: memory vs. hope, silence vs. light. Final renunciation (leaving the pearl) carries visible cost: she forfeits sole guardianship of the sky. One slip: “weight she had carried for years” edges toward label-speak before the salt-taste grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—public silence vs. intimate grafting—drives every beat; the micro-choice to splice the rose into the rack crystallizes her hierarchy of values (forgiveness over vindication) with visible cost (kneeling, thorns, peat). The amber pendant’s final flare is earned by prior tactile attention, not deus-ex-machina. Minor slip: “protected vulnerability” is named rather than embodied in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The novelist’s contradictory impulses—using beauty to evade truth—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (pressing the shell, speaking names) that culminate in a costly renunciation. Each ghost’s gift forces a visible shift in stance, and the final release of characters is earned by prior confessions. Interiority stays embodied and specific; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s mix of tinkering brilliance and lyrical empathy feels organically her own; her reluctance-shed-of-burden transition is visibly paid for by the dirge that costs both breath and tears, foreclosing silence with golden afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s embodied patience and micro-choices (heel-to-toe steps, pulse-mapping) are vivid and consistent; the interior contradiction between grief and precision is dramatized through her refusal to hurry. The final renunciation—accepting the orchard’s death while stealing its memory—carries felt cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (mother memory) stays within BRR and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlen’s interior contradiction—wanting to trap wonder yet remaining “peripherally focused”—is embodied in every micro-adjustment of dial and flame; the final renunciation (sealing wonder in the cellar while hearing its reverse-tick) carries a felt cost of exile from immediacy, earned by the preceding angle-by-angle surrender of lived echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.4)
    Deep embodiment: her ribs "calcify without breaking," her collarbones feel "wet wool." Internal contradiction sustains—she both gathers and surrenders burdens. The avalanche failure is dramatized not explained; its weight absorbs flame in the climax. Micro-choices (tilting burner, pursed exhales) scale motive. Earned stasis: calcified bones decide she can leave but remain permanently alloyed to grotto. All high-band tests met.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the blank vs. compressing it—play out in embodied micro-choices under the kettle’s ticking clock. The final renunciation (carving becomes portable absence) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the carving is “already gone” yet pocketed. Interiority is concrete, specific, and avoids therapy-speak. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “harvested from the nights” edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the camera wheel vs releasing every story—are dramatized in real time; the final renunciation costs her the very tool that defined her scavenger identity, an earned stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s curiosity and functional-creative nature are repeatedly enacted—kneeling to feel vibration, aligning sextant fragments, sketching star-chart schematics. Motivation scales believably as each rerouting act costs physical stamina and widens emotional orbit. Interiority is specific and embodied, e.g., “felt the old instrument remember voyages it never took.” Final renunciation of recovered terminal as a static memorial carries earned cost under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—fear of the world’s noise vs. longing for silence—is embodied in micro-choices (kneeling, palms open, pressing forehead to stone). The final renunciation of saleable brass for memory-built gears is earned by the garden’s patient refraction and carries visible cost: the sphere absorbs the drawing, sealing the dream inside. One slip: “excruciatingly gentle” recurs as label rather than embodied sensation, softening peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots soft on planks, the dial burning into skin—yet her contradictory impulses (clinging to certainty vs. embracing deception) crystallize only in the final mirror scene. The paper-rope micro-choice and the cutting of the tether earn the renunciation with felt cost. Earlier beats lean on evocative summary rather than dramatized struggle, keeping the score shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hara’s interiority is embodied in trembling hands, salt-tongued whispers, and the rope’s warmth; his contradictory impulses—hunger for knowledge vs reverence—drive every micro-choice. The final renunciation (to weave, not store) is earned by the tactile ordeal and the weavers’ charged lesson, with visible cost in the glowing coil he now bears. Flaws (naïve faith, fear of loss) complicate the coaxing and remain unresolved, yielding Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"tasted explained absences in it"—but the final renunciation feels slightly under-motivated; the thread’s warmth is vivid yet the cost of letting go is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Halric’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the egg yet choosing to leap—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing the shell to his ribs, stepping to the window). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the palace falls, his wings burn. Interiority is specific and character-bound; no stock phrasing. Flaws (naïve faith in artificers, grief paralysis) complicate the climax without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—daughter of an arsonist turned firefighter—grounds every beat, but the gift of the coin to a stranger she just met edges close to un-earned epiphany; cost is visible (the coin is gone), yet the emotional calculus could plume more sharply in the handshake moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory flicker of doubt at the seventh fountain crystallizes the moral cost. The micro-choice to press the shard against the box is earned by prior beats and visibly alters her stance. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Skepticism-to-belief arc is credible and specific to her perceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sentimentalist’s grief is embodied in luminous, tactile detail; her micro-choice to leave the gear behind crystallizes a costly renunciation. Interior contradiction—yearning to break the cycle yet fearing the loss of lineage—surfaces in the sync of heart and gear. The final dispersal into photons feels earned by the prior pattern of generational burning. Only the ancestors’ brief apparitions lack individuated pressure, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting to fix grief in stone yet learning it must flow—drives every beat; the embodied moment of touching the glowing ribbon and deciding to carve a single line shows earned change with visible cost. Her flaws (inability to “lift” grief alone) shape tactics and final stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Slight reserve: spectral mentor’s guidance edges toward convenient wisdom rather than earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip “worn smooth,” the rake handle’s weight in her pulse—yet the ethical diligence trait is asserted more than tested until the final beat. The incremental absolution covenant is dramatized through micro-choices (accepting fractions of guilt), and the final act of inserting the handle into the bob shows earned change with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously in scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the warm sovereign case, the creaking knees, the tug of threads on her sleeve. Her contradictory impulses (join the forgiving morning vs. tend the graves) collide in the final beat, and the choice to name “Tomorrow” costs her the immediate reunion. The single on-page character is fully individuated; no relationship crucible is required. One minor slip: “blithe” is asserted rather than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cartographer’s interior contradiction—yearning to create yet fearing the cost—drives every beat; her micro-choice to sketch equations in frost embodies the trait “groundedly imaginative” and forecloses easier miracles. The final renunciation (accepting limits) is earned by prior modeling and carries visible cost: the quill dulls, the spire seals. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV interiority is specific and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    The copyist’s drive—“to teach dust to tell stories”—is anchored in every micro-choice: bending over brittle scores, coaxing motes, vial next to heart. Her interiority is vivid without label-speak; the single contradictory fear (silence vs release) underpins the final choice. Relationships are absent, so crucible tests are moot; the earned stasis—carrying the luminous vial away—carries visible price of ongoing vigilance. Minor slip: tears+taste on cheeks lands as slight cliché in an otherwise tactile final image (-0.2 for register drift).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—ash on fingers, porcelain cutting cheeks—yet the contradictory impulses (guilt vs. unfinished love) remain mostly atmospheric rather than forcing a visible micro-choice until the final mask-removal. The renunciation is earned and costly, but earlier beats lean on lyric summary more than pressured action.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Philosopher-protagonist’s interiority is vivid, contradictory in scene, and every choice is specific—covering maps in wax, clasping the frost-warm cog, deciding to dig with patience. The final act of leaving seeds on the parapet is earned; cost is felt in salt-taste and exile.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ms. Vale’s interior contradiction—teaching harmony while nursing a barbed slur—is embodied in her tactile handling of the rosette; the micro-choice to press it to her sternum seals an earned renunciation with visible cost. The child’s silent acceptance extends the crucible, but the girl’s agency is off-page until the coda, capping relationship pressure at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s contradictory impulses—grief for her grandmother’s loss vs. the imperative to plant memory—are embodied in the act of pruning; each snip releases a memory that re-weights her next choice. The final graft of the knowledge seed onto the dead vine is earned by every preceding micro-choice and carries the visible cost of renouncing simple restoration. Interiority is chef-specific (tongue, flavor, recipe) and avoids therapy-speak. One slip: “informally wise” is stated rather than dramatized in the single spoken line.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marisol’s involuntary truth-telling trait is dramatized early and shapes her final, costly admission; her embodied climb and the warm coin in her hand give tactile cost. Interiority stays specific to her, though the “wonder” epiphany edges toward label-speak. The earned stasis—accepting that the tower’s song has changed key—feels proportionate to the 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—“the shard warmed against her palm” grounds motive in tactile detail. The final renunciation—leaving the shard—earns its cost through the prior accumulation of hushed absences. Motivation remains consistent: witness, not purify. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurele’s interiority—stone nerves threaded with private fears—embodies contradiction; the telepathy that once promised certainty now demands mercy. The micro-choice to thread foxglove memory into its own fracture shows a visible cost: bronze warms, stone bleeds color, and the statue’s prior rigidity is renounced. Motivation is rooted in the flaw that rigidity wounds; the final stance crystallizes with felt price. Only the absence of a second on-page figure keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the dice as scar anchors motive. The final reach through the boundary crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor drift into abstract self-diagnosis (“regret is simply the integral…”) slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s insomnia and hope are embodied in tactile choices—twirling the brush, painting glyphs—rather than labels. The final refusal to sleep carries cost: the brush dissolves, a visible forfeiture. Interiority is specific and sensory, not diagnostic. The only gap: the janitor’s sudden tearful confession feels externally supplied, not filtered through Mira’s strained perception.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysandra’s fierce “yeast” motivation and embodied micro-choice—kneading initials into bread—propel the climax and demonstrate genuine struggle; interiority remains vivid, even as speech pattern convergence slightly softens individual edges.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marrow’s refusal of “fate’s metronome” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—prying the stone, threading the yoyo—each action revealing a hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction surfaces as he relives his father’s strike while still pressing forward, the pain “licks but also clarifies.” The final asymmetrical smile earns the renunciation with visible cost: the lighthouse beam now “zigzagging…in absurd Morse,” a derangement he both authored and must live with.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s contradictory impulses—hunger to outwit fear vs. dread of the cursed photo—are embodied in micro-choices (hand on Polaroid, lunging for the black mirror). The final renunciation of the frame is earned by prior causal chain; cost is the eternal advisor trapped in the clasp. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the advisor’s motives remain slightly abstract, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific; her heartbeat literally carves the plank, linking fear to action. Motivation (turn obstacles into instruments) is dramatized through micro-choices—tapping, carving, stepping onto the branch—each escalating risk. The final laugh and spiral trace show earned endurance with visible cost: the orchard is now “conducted,” a path foreclosed. Only minor drift: no contradictory impulses voiced in scene, slightly smoothing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Neris’s obsession with mapping and her quiet drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices—climbing the ridge, pressing the whistle to the crack—each action tightening the stakes. The interior contradiction between curiosity and dread is dramatized when her lips bleed into the reed, a visceral cost that forecloses retreat. The lost explorers serve as pressure rather than relationship, so relationship crucible is waived. Final renunciation—walking through the gate—earns its cost by the prior bodily toll and the city’s tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The historian’s drive to rescue truth is internalized and embodied from the first line; the blood drop at the end literalizes the cost of her rational composure. Each micro-action—prying the lid, etching the copper lines—reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible risk to credibility and body. Her self-command remains intact, yet the thorn-prick forces an embodied wince she cannot rationalize away.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her fingertip tracing “grief pressed into mortar” shows stoic sensitivity in action. Motivation (archeologist of absence) is dramatized through micro-choices: dropping ink, measuring hollows, writing notes. The final whispered promise earns a resonant cost, though the heartbeat-in-the-wall moment edges toward convenient epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—logic versus wonder—drives every beat; the stamp in her palm crystallizes her choice to abandon certainty. Embodied emotion (“reclaimed stillness settle on her shoulders like silt”) anchors her arc. Final renunciation of digital verdicts costs her institutional authority and is earned by prior tactile discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—trapping light yet releasing grief—are embodied in the folding of cranes; the final smile is earned by the visible cost of relinquishing the memory-sphere. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—shrapnel ribs, violet seams mapping futures—but the final broadcast gesture feels slightly abstract; the cost is legible yet not fully dramatized in her body. Motivation stays coherent: grief transmuted into perturbation hunt. Micro-choices (sealing half the geode, thumbing the console) anchor stakes. Still, the shift from private ritual to external broadcast could use one more embodied beat to earn the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to slot the chip into the drone’s “injured bird” heart crystallizes her arc. The pilgrim’s silent pressure and branded wrist create a credible crucible without head-hopping. Only the pilgrim’s vanishing feels slightly convenient, trimming the top edge.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt, embodied in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, sifting, digging, replacing the hand), drives every beat; her renunciation of silence in the final paragraph is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the public tear of her notebook page into the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is precise—her micro-choice to hold silence until the guard stills reveals status mastery—and her final exhale carries visible cost. The prisoners’ regrets are embodied (trembling fingers, whitening knuckles) rather than labeled. Only the boy’s “voice cracking like thawing ice” edges toward cliché, keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensorily embodied ("salt-stained palm," "rasp of conscience"); micro-choices under pressure (paddling toward fog, surrendering compass) reveal a lucid value hierarchy. The final hand-in-hand image renounces but keeps the ache, meeting the 9+ quick test yet capped at 8.7 because the “backlash = love” line skirts diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“slate still smelled faintly of gunpowder and regret”), but the amnesia conceit blurs the link between past crimes and present choice; the final act of rescue feels more symbolic than causally compelled by the character’s contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ayla's contradictory impulses—grief vs. the vow to trade her shape—are embodied in the tremor of her palms and the deliberate steadiness of her pulse; the final surrender of her human name carries a felt cost that is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation crystallizes in the impossible bargain to “gather back” lost time; embodied emotion in the frost-breath and the stylus that “stole a sliver of her warmth” grounds interiority. Contradictory impulses—flight vs. surrender—co-exist in the same beats. Final renunciation (accepting the scar) is earned and carries visible cost: the thread she cannot grasp. Minor slip: “willingly perplexed” is label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lin’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—peeling photos gently, stitching with salvaged thread—yet the interior contradiction between mercy and necessary sacrifice is dramatized only once, when she offers the tear. The final renunciation is earned and costly, but the emotional layering could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting to give yet being emptied by it—drives every micro-choice; the final release of the last bug crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost (the glass handprint). Reflection stays anchored in present action and alters her stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile attention to the quill holder and the “conspiratorial wink” of silence reveal layered motives. The final bow with glinting bronze shows earned duplicity and cost. Minor: her flaw (obedience vs rebellion) is stated more than dramatized in mid-scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The herder’s grief-propelled quest is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to shift the stone sequence crystallizes interior contradiction. Yet the mother-vision functions more as oracle than relationship crucible, so the relational pressure feels one-sided. Still, the final endurance—scattering the rocks while cradling the jar—pays the visible cost the arc demands.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“furiously tranquil” hands, scars on palms), but the poet’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Micro-choices (slipping fragment into developer, pressing it to lens) are present yet lack visible cost until the last beat. Still, the character’s refusal to finish the vigil until the storm completes the circuit earns a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysandra’s contradictory impulses—intellectual detachment vs. visceral need to bury the overture—surface in micro-choices (aligning needles, flipping the card). The envoy’s diplomatic ferocity pressures her into the final renunciation, costing her the secrecy she once guarded. Interiority is embodied in brass clicks and gear-song rather than labels. The mechanical arm is more ornament than flaw, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lark’s molting trait and Mira’s counter-gift of “Anchor” create a credible interior struggle that charges the final renunciation; the wrist inscription crystallizes the cost of remaining Lark. Relationship pressure is intimate and stakes are scaled to the word count. Minor slip: the molting is told more than dramatized in body.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pianist’s longing is embodied in micro-choices—threading the reel, lifting the single frame—each action tethered to the frozen clock and the lost lover. Interior contradiction surfaces as he both rewrites the past and accepts its cost when the clock shatters into a lily. The final smile is earned because every prior beat has rehearsed renunciation; the cost is the exploded timepiece and the postponed night.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tasting of stories, the pollen on her lips—but the “empirically whimsical” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile with “luminous doubt” is earned yet the cost feels slightly under-registered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Helini’s interiority is embodied and specific; the compass-under-tongue beat crystallizes her renunciation with felt cost. The withheld apology and final drift toward “blue beyond apology” trace a credible internal arc. Only the apprentice remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction (studying violent collapses yet seeking quiet erosion) drives micro-choices like spectral analysis of wings; humility feels earned through embodied details ("brushed soil from her knees") not abstract epiphany. Final renunciation of "loud endings" crystallizes with visible cost in the ashen specimens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority concretely embodied in frost-reading and shard-handling; final renunciation earned through mentor's "follow the pause" motif. Slight thematic echo in "purpose hides in pauses" edges toward abstraction but stays anchored in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Exceptional embodied emotion (fear as crimson, wonder as gold) avoids label-speak; micro-choices like angling glass reveal value hierarchy. Lacks contradictory impulses in climax—final chord feels inevitable rather than contested—missing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "inadvertently stubborn" refusal to let memories unrested, embodied through micro-choices like writing his own name despite hesitation. Bleeding ink-and-salt fingers reveal cost, but brief backstory about burying villagers lacks concrete present-moment impact on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lila’s embodied leadership shines via micro-choices (kissing the bell, flour-dusted touch) and the iron/honey taste of her declaration, but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments—resilience remains unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (fearing love's finitude vs seeking healing) drive choices, but "spiritually curious" label lacks embodied tradeoffs; epiphany risks abstraction though grounded in breath mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "spreading curiosity" amid disintegration, but "becoming the question" edges toward abstraction. Micro-choices like pressing the halo to the willow root motivation, though the crayon maze callback lacks concrete emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Embodied contradiction shines: strategic calm ("counting heartbeats") clashes with raw desperation, driving micro-choices like arrow notch for chain escape. Mother's lullaby memory earns planting motivation without diagnostic labels. Minor depth gap in backstory integration prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority grounds abstract motivation through synesthetic embodiment ("forge’s orange hummed like a distant trumpet"), but brother’s memory revelation edges toward convenient epiphany without sufficient prior causal tension in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in the thief’s duality—stealing portraits yet releasing them—with embodied emotion (jar as "second heartbeat") and micro-choices like the spiral flower code. Final renunciation feels earned through her realization that portraits are "questions posed to the dark," avoiding epiphanies via stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction (abandonment vs staying) embodied through glassblower's tactile perception; final choice earned by prior causality (bookmark history, thawing rhythm) with felt cost in "wet and gleaming" heart. Slight abstraction in "wanderers" motivation prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "phobia screamed but I was firmly adaptive" as micro-choices (decrypting cast, climbing stairs) reveal hierarchy of values. Twin's thin motivation slightly weakens relationship crucible despite strong embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "mildly obsessed" is labeled not embodied. Final renunciation (tearing sleeve) earns closure but motivation remains singularly focused without internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses (denial/rage/acceptance) manifest physically during amalgamation; "burned with recognition" embodies cost without diagnostic labels. Final choice to carry violin as "lens" earns irreversible change through prior looped micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction ("honesty hurts because it adds nothing") and embodied emotion ("feeling strangely unmasked") deepen motivation, but predecessor's sudden appearance lacks full causal grounding for his change, slightly weakening earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's embodied contradictions shine: pragmatic marble-polishing ritual reveals her value hierarchy under pressure, though the queen's internal shift lacks sufficient micro-choices to fully earn her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in "obliging sky mechanic" vs private urgency; embodied cost crystallizes in nexus spelling brother's name. Minor friction: moth-whales' agitation slightly externalizes her emotional arc without deepening micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in Mara's liminal existence ("between stage and audience, sound and silence") driving her to disrupt the legend she's drawn to; embodied choices like reading silence as language and playing the clarinet bell against water show earned agency without diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority shines via embodied choices (Elias' graphite-smudged glacier revision) and contradictory impulses (oracle's margin-hugging method vs. final confession), but oracle's passivity slightly dilutes agency; micro-choices earn the hand-hold closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s religious skepticism versus Saint Jude medal, with micro-choices (rotating the wheel) revealing her truth-seeking hierarchy. Jonah’s off-page presence limits relationship pressure, slightly diluting the crucible effect at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "grips reality loosely" stated not dramatized; final chronicle inscription shows earned endurance yet no visible micro-choice under pressure during key moments like the earthquake observation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses shine: Lila’s guarded hope ("cautious exuberance trembling") vs. maternal grief embodied in the curl’s warmth. Rowan’s muteness broken by music—not words—earns closure with visceral cost (the tear). Flaw: Marisol’s distance lacks active friction beyond postcards.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines via "curator vs courier" realization; embodied emotion in "heart ticking like a clock" avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: no visible struggle between collecting compulsion and courier duty during pivotal diary reading.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lin's interior contradiction (craving change vs. fear of lost control) drives the burn-and-broadcast pivot with embodied cost ("tears that tasted of brine"). Mara avoids stereotype through regretful agency, though Lin's shift from burning film to proposing broadcast lacks sufficient friction in the crucial micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "muffled clarity, syllables wrapped in felt yet sharp as glass shards," but demon’s hesitation lacks embodied emotion; micro-choices under pressure (palette lift, pedal taps) earn closure yet emotional progression feels abstracted at peak stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through mapping urgency vs. exhaustion; embodied emotion in "metal and pine" memory taste. Micro-choices like rotating the shell for dawn light reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to lower the shell is earned through accumulated sensory anchors, though the eight-year-old's sudden comprehension lacks prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction manifests in simultaneous impulses: retracing to land yet propelled by the wish that made her weightless. Final surrender of the tablet earns endurance with visceral cost ("gravity claiming her at last"). No therapy-speak; emotions embodied through concrete action like kneeling on the hospital marble.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)

    Interior contradiction ("beauty to avoid truth") and embodied emotion (boots in ink-smelling mud) drive choices, but "conflicted novelist" archetype borders on stock despite strong micro-choices like naming release.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora's motivation ("restore sacred practices") is clear and embodied through micro-choices like winding the crank, but lacks contradictory impulses; her flawless execution under pressure feels unearned for high-band entry despite strong sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in "grief was a kind of hurry" as Lira suppresses emotion to sustain ritual; embodied choices like heel-to-toe movement reveal character under pressure without therapy-speak. Slight underdevelopment of alchemy specifics holds back full 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels with embodied burdens ("pressing against collarbones like wet wool"), but "boundary-lessly trapped" lacks causal friction; calcification as earned endurance compensates with visible cost during sphere transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.7)
    Interior contradiction embodied in "afraid any knife stroke would release the roar" versus compressing absence; final pocketing of carving shows earned endurance with visible cost in "weight you can carry without bleeding." No diagnostic labels—grief manifests through thumb-presses and wood grain.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elian’s fear of "the world would break it" versus his graphite-redrawn silent mechanism; embodied emotion in "palms open, letting chill enter skin" avoids labels. Slight causality gap in crystal’s whisper initiating action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses crystallize when naming self-lies aloud while sundial burns spiral onto skin—embodied cost of self-deception confronting truth. Flawed motivation (trading decade of notes for myth) intensifies to becoming part of the map without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority leans poetic over contradictory; "reverence" dominates without counter-impulse during decoding. Final choice to "plant knowledge with gestures" lacks prior micro-choices showing struggle against abstraction, though "trembling with cold and reverence" hints at embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's contradictory impulses (fear/duty, pain/compassion) act simultaneously in scene; final coin gift earns closure through prior causality with visible cost ("unstrung the red thread").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. hope) drive key choices under pressure, notably at the seventh fountain where her doubt crystallizes into action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's embodied emotion ("throat tightened," "voice steady as winter iron") and contradictory impulses—carving stone versus understanding migration—drive authentic choices. Micro-decisions like unspooling the ribbon tie to her grief arc, though off-page family members lack pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws feel genuine in her need to "shape that motion into stone."

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction ("blithe" vs grave duty) shown through humming and creaking knees, but "feels the weight of every seed" edges toward abstract reflection rather than embodied choice under pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction evident in "guilt and unfinished love," but motivation for ash-weaving ritual lacks concrete roots; "crystallize fleeting emotion" remains abstract without specific biographical anchors. Micro-choices like whispering "lies shaped like syrup" reveal value hierarchy yet flaws don't compound causally.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marisol's "involuntarily truthful" trait drives micro-choices (e.g., "I don’t know, but I hope so" to travelers) and crystallizes her final declaration with embodied cost; no diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes realization.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction ("certainty cracked harder than marble") and embodied emotion ("fingers that cannot bend yet ache with antique mercy") avoid therapy-speak. Final choice to thread filament earns change through prior telepathic vulnerability, but single-POV limits relationship crucible assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "grim optimist" who walks to prove existence while seeking escape; embodied emotion in "texture of missed opportunity grind against my skin" avoids labels. Secondary character limited to visions weakens relationship crucible despite poignant dice exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "methodically hopeful" exhaustion vs creative urgency; embodied micro-choices (resisting sleep to witness proof) earn closure. Minor credibility dip in 71-hour insomnia not tested under pressure until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lysandra’s motivation to rescue dying arts manifests in concrete micro-choices: abandoning passive lens-refraction for active bread-baking, her "L" initial sharing space with Amara’s "A".

Final choice to lunge for the black mirror earns endurance through prior causality. Minor competence overreach in instantly grasping recursion weakens struggle slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s manufactured memories vs. her hidden guilt; embodied emotion in "palms against stone balustrade" and "breath fogged the tin" avoids labels. Micro-choice to dig for truth earns final voice choice with felt cost: abandoning her trade.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction embodied through physical actions (paddling "merrily melancholic" amid regret), micro-choices like counting utility poles as "rosary beads of regret," and no diagnostic labels. Final renunciation earned by tactile cost: "compass glass cut him" and "scar" traced.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (hiding/using baseball) and embodied emotion ("hollow where cruelty had lived") power micro-choices under pressure; time traveler detail lacks causal integration with empathy arc, slightly weakening motivation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in "surrender could feel so much like flight" and the preemptive hand tracing—a ghost of future she might steal back.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    No contradictory impulses visible; Mara’s reflective consistency lacks internal friction. Strength: embodied epiphany through sand/grit/sting avoids therapy-speak. Weakness: no struggle between competing desires during releases.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira's "simple and fierce" motivation slightly told; "luminous doubt" blind spot shown through micro-choices (tasting flat tales, planting depth as lullaby) but internal contradiction needs sharper embodiment during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction lacks sufficient simultaneous tension; the "unspoken sigh" echoes but micro-choices like sealing the lace box don't actively wrestle with competing impulses.
