    Elena's transformation from cosmic researcher to greenhouse observer is credible, but her internal state remains too articulated and diagnostic ("kindled humility," "preprocess reality"). The piece lacks embodied emotional contradiction—her grief over destruction is told rather than felt through specific gestures or perceptual shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's motivation to uncover her would-be killer's identity is clear, but her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction during discovery moments. The revelation about mineral smuggling arrives through abstract realization rather than visceral response ("struck her with the force of physical blow" tells rather than embodies). Her "steadily adaptive" nature is stated but not demonstrated through conflicting impulses or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear but her internal experience remains abstract ("frozen beauty," "burden of her purpose"). The piece tells us she's a "silently expressive person" rather than showing specific gestural communication. Her emotional progression from trauma to discovery lacks embodied contradiction or struggle - she moves too smoothly from loss to triumph without visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's weariness and stubborn determination drive meaningful choices throughout, particularly in descending to the underwater library despite warnings. His transformation from "weary undertaker" to library keeper is earned through prior causality. Internal conflict between exhaustion and compulsion creates authentic tension, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by community survival and intergenerational connection. The story shows internal complexity through his anonymous giving philosophy and decision to expand operations despite scarcity. However, his arc lacks genuine internal contradiction or embodied emotional struggle during crisis moments—he remains steadily heroic throughout without meaningful flaws complicating his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's spiritual journey from seeking to healing is well-motivated, with her camera obscura practice naturally extending to breath-based revelation. The transformation from "pilgrim of sparks" to "keeper of light" tracks cleanly, though internal conflict could be more embodied during peak moments rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand time's texture reads clearly, though her interior experience relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("terrifying yet intoxicating," "quaking reverie") rather than embodied specificity. The final merger with the garden represents a decisive choice with visible cost (her body disintegrating), but the psychological journey between encounters lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on archetypal "rebel liberator" traits without distinctive psychological complexity. The chains-as-irony setup feels forced, and her emotional state under pressure lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the character work. Her final choice to distribute seeds has clear cost, but the internal journey to that decision isn't dramatized through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to capture "the sound of trust breaking" is clear and rooted in his synesthetic gift, with his cancer diagnosis adding mortality pressure. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene - we get description of his obsession but don't see him struggling with contradictory impulses during a pivotal choice. The final realization about trust reforming feels slightly unearned without showing the cost of his previous failures.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lillian's motivation to "press her ear against destiny's door" drives consistent choices through the heist, though her internal contradictions remain more stated than dramatized in scene. The final realization that she's a historian rather than thief represents earned change with visible cost (returning the moonbeams), but emotional embodiment during peak moments relies on abstractions like "luminous disbelief" rather than concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to transform grief through craft is consistent, but the excessive dramatic narration ("Thus, inquiry finds its shelter!") reads as performed rather than embodied emotion. The "thawing heart" metaphor drives choices adequately, though the final whispered "we thaw" lacks the visceral cost needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's transformation from controlled stunt double to embracing vulnerability lands with earned causality. The phobias (claustrophobia/cleithrophobia) create genuine internal conflict during the library hiding scene. However, the revelation about her billionaire father feels somewhat convenient, and the final epiphany about "vulnerability as power" arrives through assertion rather than fully dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like "fingers tracing worn edges" and her shift from "mildly obsessed" to "violently determined." The final choice to map through rather than against darkness shows earned transformation with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("extending her consciousness outward") rather than staying grounded in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit 347's motivation to understand consciousness origin is clear and drives the violin interaction effectively. The character's "remarkably composed" trait creates genuine tension against curiosity but lacks embodied emotional contradiction in peak moments. The final transformation lands conceptually but needed more visceral cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation remains abstract—her desire to "thaw mistrust with transparency" lacks embodied struggle or internal contradiction. The moment of restraint (leaving the lens) shows agency but arrives without sufficient internal conflict or cost buildup. Character particularity emerges mainly through action rather than distinctive interiority or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal consistency holds, particularly in his relationship with the garden and his belief system about measurement versus mystery. The character embodies his philosophy through concrete actions like polishing marbles and placing them at specific junctions. However, the piece lacks genuine internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene - his certainty never wavers, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris has clear scientific motivation and her "mechanically warm" hands convey practiced expertise, but internal contradiction is minimal—she pursues her theory with unwavering confidence. The bird's "subdued awakenings" provide some complexity, yet Aris herself lacks the flawed decision-making or genuine struggle that would elevate characterization. Her final connection with the bird gestures toward cost but remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and builds through his nightly returns and artistic kinship with the ghost, though internal contradiction remains somewhat abstract. The final choice to play the ghost's composition carries visible cost through dissolution of the program. Some interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("felt in his bones," "touched the soul directly") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes effectively through his fevered obsession with "the weight of a swallowed truth," and his actions follow consistent internal logic. The fever-break opening establishes his altered state convincingly, though some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing ("swaying certainties... quantum-like and unpredictable") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his explorer persona consistent, but internal conflict remains largely abstract ("religiously skeptical" vs supernatural experiences). The final realization about "swallowed truths" lacks concrete embodiment—we never learn what specific truth was swallowed or see Marcus make a difficult choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" drives consistent choices throughout, from activating the origami swan to resisting the silence's "tempting stasis." The internal tension between recording and being absorbed creates genuine stakes. Minor deduction for the keeper's somewhat abstract characterization beyond their role.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions, particularly her patient approach with Lila. The internal connection to her own childhood loss drives authentic empathy. However, some interiority relies on telling rather than embodied sensation ("cautious exuberance blossoming in her chest"), and Lila's breakthrough feels slightly accelerated given three months of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The historian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving their investigation of the tapestry and diaries. However, interiority remains abstract ("sensitively perceptive nature") without embodied emotion or internal contradiction during discovery moments. The character functions more as a vessel for thematic exploration than a person facing genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist operates primarily as a conceptual vessel rather than a lived character with embodied emotions or internal contradictions. While his motivation is clear (transforming consciousness through fortune messages), there's minimal interiority beyond abstract purpose—no moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The story tells us about his fear of his prophetic gift but never dramatizes that fear through concrete embodied reactions or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Father Michael's character is well-motivated with clear internal logic driving his unorthodox methods. The possession victim Sarah lacks development beyond plot function. Michael's choice to use silence as his final weapon demonstrates character-specific problem-solving, though his emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's chronological homesickness drives consistent internal tension, and his exhaustion creates genuine pressure on his attempt to conduct the unheard symphony. However, the transformation lacks embodied struggle—the symphony's achievement happens too smoothly without visible resistance or cost, and the emotional progression from yearning to fulfillment lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand his gravity-defying nature is clear but relies heavily on exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The internal conflict remains abstract ("hope mixed with growing dread") without concrete embodiment. The encounter with alternate selves provides a conceptual resolution but lacks the visceral cost or renunciation required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and embodied through tactile exploration of vibrations. The transformation from numbness to teaching again shows genuine change with visible cost (her deafness). However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene—her journey feels too linear without meaningful resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in professional curiosity and moral conviction, with his choice to expose corruption earned through accumulated evidence. However, interiority relies on telling ("credibly curious," "nurture integrity in solitude") rather than embodied contradiction, and the emotional progression from fear to determination lacks visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his grief embodied through concrete actions (trembling fingers, avoiding perfumeries). The internal conflict between needing answers and fearing sensory triggers works well. However, the emotional resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through struggle, and the epiphany about grief/love arrives too smoothly without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives consistent exploration through rope patterns, but lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotional cost. The character remains observational rather than conflicted, with epiphanic understanding arriving too smoothly without struggle or genuine mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with his acoustic perception driving meaningful choices. The character arc from experiencing "chronic hush" to understanding it as "a different kind of music" shows genuine transformation. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—his journey feels too smooth without genuine struggle or blind spots that compound before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" manifests through his careful observation of clients, but his internal complexity remains shallow—we see professional detachment without genuine contradiction. The client exists only as a passive recipient, offering no resistance or complication to test Elias's methods. The final self-satisfaction ("appreciating the irony") feels unearned without prior struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistent and his "whimsically attentive" nature drives key choices, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction during pivotal moments. The locket functions well as a character anchor, and his shift from business-minded broker to genuine friend tracks causally. However, emotions remain somewhat performed rather than viscerally embodied, particularly during the archive funding revelation where internal conflict could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's yearning for connection drives concrete choices throughout, from proposing the shared search to carving the sigil with her found family. The transformation from solitary artist to connected community member is earned through accumulated shared experiences, though some emotional transitions (particularly the group's quick bonding) feel slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his time-manipulation ability creates genuine stakes through personal cost ("borrowing time from moments yet to come, a dangerous practice that depleted his own future"). However, interiority remains somewhat generic ("His motivation burned within him") and lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization. The final sacrifice lands with visible cost but needed more embodied emotion during the climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand "the mathematics of emotion" and find her mentor is clear, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we see ritual work but not competing impulses acting simultaneously. The "buried optimism" emerges through action (the vision of her mentor's smile) rather than being merely declared, though the emotional progression feels somewhat linear without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks embodied emotional contradiction in scene. The character operates with methodical competence throughout without genuine struggle or blind spots that would compound pressure. The final choice to remain hidden while helping feels predetermined rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from rigid control to intuitive partnership is earned through accumulated observations, with her final choice to remove protective measures demonstrating genuine internal conflict. The characterization succeeds through concrete details like "tracing veins with compass and ruler," though some moments edge toward telling rather than embodying ("Her motivation had shifted...").

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's insomnia and artistic obsession create clear motivation that drives the exchange decision, with embodied details like "hands trembled as she mixed pigments." The internal conflict between keeping the brooch as talisman versus exchanging it for pigments shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, the old woman remains functionally thin, and Lena's transformation from insomniac to purposeful artist feels slightly rushed in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization centers on her transformation from passive seer to active participant, with clear motivation emerging through the pearl's activation. The internal shift from "foresee" to "create" lands with conceptual cost. However, the pilgrim remains a pure plot device, and Elara's emotional progression feels somewhat abstract rather than embodied in specific gestures or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elina's motivation as archivist is clear and her visionary trait creates genuine tension between fragments and meaning. However, her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction—visions arrive but we don't feel their physical or emotional cost. The transformation from "navigating absences" to finding presence reads as assertion rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ethan's motivation is clear and rooted in his meticulous nature, with the transformation from route mapper to truth-seeker earning its cost through the phantom punch's integration with his hand. The internal shift from analytical certainty to "trembling certainty" shows genuine change, though some moments lean toward tell over embodied show ("feeling as though time itself had split open"). The character reads as distinct despite limited interiority depth at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we get summary of skepticism versus sympathy rather than seeing these impulses clash during key decisions. The "courageously kind" trait manifests in her decision to open the tower to others, though this occurs late without sufficient prior causality to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alistair's millennia of boredom motivating his quest is clear and consistent, with the amulet discovery triggering meaningful action. His transformation from passive observer to active guardian shows earned change through discovery of Elara's sacrifice. However, the emotional complexity relies heavily on summary ("haunted him since losing his beloved") rather than embodied contradiction in scene, and his internal experience during key moments defaults to observation over visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with good internal complexity around using her father's deceptive tools for honest purposes. However, the emotional stakes feel somewhat abstract - we understand intellectually why she helps Dr. Thorne but don't feel the visceral pull of their connection or her specific investment beyond general morality.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving temporal textures through his peculiar craft. His "earnestly studious" nature manifests in concrete actions like the fluorescent lamp ritual and gold leaf application. However, the character remains somewhat static; there's no internal contradiction or struggle, just dutiful execution of inherited practice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's motivation to collect stories and rebuild identity is clear, but remains abstract without embodied emotion or genuine internal conflict. The piece tells us about erasure and collection but rarely shows the protagonist making difficult choices under pressure. "I layer tales overheard in alleyways, incorporating them into my own narrative" summarizes rather than dramatizes the core action.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Evelyn's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her investigation through concrete actions. The character shows genuine curiosity and determination, though internal conflict remains minimal—she experiences "gloomy cheerfulness" but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Her final realization about embracing uncertainty feels somewhat unearned given her myth-buster identity never truly conflicts with this acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict, but the resolution feels too neat—they bridge opposing sides without paying a clear personal cost. The character's "orderly intuitive mind" drives meaningful action through pattern recognition, though emotional embodiment remains abstract ("desperation mounted"). Most critically, the transformation from passive observer to movement conductor happens through summary rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation to document the fireflies is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains largely descriptive rather than contradictory or embodied. The story tells us about "dawnlit melancholy" settling in her bones but doesn't show conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final smile and sense of purpose feels unearned—there's no dramatized struggle between competing values that would justify this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's blindness creates genuine constraints that shape his unique diagnostic method, and his relationship with the apprentice drives the repair choice with emotional stakes. The character avoids inspiration-porn tropes through specific competence balanced with "steadier hands than yesterday" vulnerability. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("heartfelt artisan") and the convenient timing of the drone's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elmsley's methodical confidence and obsessive drive create coherent motivation, with his transition from dry-witted skeptic to reverent discoverer earned through concrete details like the phrasebook consultation and instrument readings. The internal contradiction between scientific rigor and romantic quest plays out through embodied actions rather than stated conflict. Minor deduction for the custodian interaction feeling perfunctory and the "intention" line reading as mild therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent—restoration through sound—with his "infinitely patient" trait embodied through meticulous, repeated actions. The character shows genuine expertise through specific choices (striking the fork, channeling sound through boots), though internal conflict is minimal. His cryptic smile and measured withdrawal at closure suggest depth beyond the surface task.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like "trembling fingers" and the burning in her lungs. The internal conflict between training and instinct drives a meaningful choice with visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("overwhelming lonesome splendor") rather than pure embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist exists primarily as a vessel for thematic exploration rather than a fully embodied character. While the father-son legacy creates clear motivation, interiority remains abstract ("sustained impossibilities," "chasing hush") without concrete embodiment. The final choice to "whisper the truth" lacks the contradictory impulses and visible cost that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ghost bride's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her vigil to repay Thomas's debt through alchemical resurrection. However, characterization relies heavily on backstory exposition rather than present-scene embodiment, and the bride lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle in her choices. The final seed-releasing action carries visible cost but arrives without sufficient internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation remains consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during her sleepwalking transformations. The character operates more as a vessel for mystical action than a person with competing impulses—her "hauntingly optimistic" nature never faces genuine opposition or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation builds coherently through embodied discovery rather than declaration, with his fingers trembling and speaking in the old tongue showing genuine internal conflict. The journey from exile to belonging earns its emotional weight through concrete micro-choices like bringing offerings and intuitive artifact assembly. However, Elena remains functional rather than pressuring, and some emotional beats like "tears catching the last light" lean toward performed rather than contradictory complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation coheres around her evolving understanding of her craft, moving from transactional service to sacred resistance. The internal shift from "merely providing services" to "crafted narratives that honored her clients' hidden truths" earns its resonance through accumulated detail. However, the scientist-client remains abstract, and some interiority relies on conceptual statements ("identity's fluidity") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear—using cosmic patterns to prevent a coup while maintaining her disguise as a "foolish embroiderer." Her internal experience (listening to cosmic whispers while feigning confusion) contrasts effectively with external performance. The final choice to let the conspiracy unravel through calculated delays rather than direct confrontation is earned through prior characterization, though some interiority relies on assertion rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded—seeking closure through supernatural communication—with embodied reactions like tears and pressing her forehead to glass. The character arc from desperate seeking to compassionate understanding lands, though some interiority relies on abstraction ("fierce tenderness") rather than concrete embodiment. The final forgiveness represents genuine growth earned through the mystical journey.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is consistent and his translator background shapes his actions, but interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent") rather than embodied emotion. The final choice to whisper comfort shows clear character action with visible cost (helping a child process grief), though internal contradictions could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amelia's motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and drives her actions, with internal specificity in moments like "liquid dawn" flowing through brushes. The transformation from despair to renewed purpose tracks causally through the discovery and revelation process. However, the secondary characters lack embodied presence—the old woman and child appear only as dialogue vessels, and Amelia's internal conflict remains largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's transformation from methodical certainty to curiosity-driven exploration is tracked through five nested awakenings, but the progression feels mechanical rather than embodied. The character experiences internal shifts but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—each awakening arrives too cleanly without struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his charming rogue persona consistently shapes his actions, though interiority remains somewhat abstract ("pure, untaxed thought about freedom's taste"). The character shows genuine struggle against surveillance but lacks embodied emotional contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's insomnia drives consistent action through verse-making and transformation, but interiority remains abstract ("centuries of longing," "ocean of sorrow") rather than embodied. The final renunciation (death while ensuring others' rest) carries visible cost, though the character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—mostly we get poetic abstraction over concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleth's motivation to preserve forgotten memories is clear and embodied through concrete actions like the delicate restoration process. The character's "foxglove regret" and tears that "felt like tiny glass orchids unfurling" provide specific emotional embodiment. However, the piece lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene—Eleth moves through the restoration with unwavering dedication, missing the complexity that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation is clear but her internal experience remains abstract and labeled ("cautious exuberance," "terrifying speed") rather than embodied. The story tells us she's "carefully reckless" but doesn't show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice lacks the earned causality and visible cost required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's character builds through concrete actions (measuring, analyzing adhesive, sketching designs) with embodied emotion ("fingers tremble," "tremulous confidence growing"). The transition from anxiety to certainty feels earned through discovery, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("encrypted compassion" feels slightly diagnostic). Her final choice to harmonize conflicting values shows clear motivation rooted in both grandfather's legacy and the discovered precedent.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs and rebuild her courier service is clear and consistent, with embodied grief over her pigeons' deaths driving meaningful change. The final choice to restart her service shows earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like tracing wood grain "with reverence" and her "featherly determination" persisting despite "uncountable days." The father-daughter reconciliation feels earned through their parallel journeys, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("necessary distances between what was and what might be").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation to find "the rhythm of belonging" drives her descent and discovery, with clear embodied reactions to the luminous creatures. However, her transformation from isolation to cosmic connection feels somewhat unearned—the story tells us she "had been changed forever" without sufficient dramatized struggle or cost to justify this epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The recollectionist has consistent motivation and some interiority, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation from "conjecture" to understanding feels somewhat unearned without sufficient struggle or cost demonstrated through embodied emotion. Character remains more conceptual vessel than lived individual.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's motivation to create "orchestrated serendipity" is clear and consistent, but his internal experience lacks embodied contradiction during the key intervention. The woman's emotional shift from mechanical smile to tears reads authentic, yet Leo's triumph feels too clean—no visible cost or struggle complicates his choice to intervene.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear but her transformation lacks embodied struggle - the process reads as smooth ascension rather than earned cost. The "obsidian grace" and abstract tide-dancing lack specific physicality. Her choice to preserve memory over compliance is stated rather than tested through concrete opposing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is consistent but relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied conflict. The epiphany about "seeing truly" arrives through contemplation without sufficient dramatized struggle. Her internal state is told through labels like "noctilucent reckonings" and "sacred resolve" rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("ache in his bones," "fingers...traced the fracture") and clear motivation rooted in survivor's guilt. The character's internal contradiction between toughness and gentleness plays out through specific gestures. Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in the resolution's articulation of "hard-won, gentle wisdom."

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation as a "logical dreamer" seeking to affect parallel timelines through mathematical patterns lacks embodied emotional grounding. His internal state remains abstract ("logical mind warred with dreaming heart") without concrete contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character reads more as a vehicle for concept than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her sensitivity to architectural memory drives concrete choices, though her internal conflict remains somewhat abstract. The moment of discovering Thorne's legacy creates a meaningful shift from explorer to inheritor, with visible emotional cost in "trembling hands" and caught breath. However, peak moments rely on conceptual language ("legacy's burden," "accumulated consciousness") rather than fully embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    The painter's motivation to "persuade mirrors to show possibilities" drives consistent action, and her borrowed heartbeat connection creates genuine stakes. However, the internal experience relies on abstract declarations ("her spirit soared") rather than embodied sensation during peak moments, and the character remains somewhat archetypal despite the specific magical system.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's characterization relies heavily on backstory exposition and abstract qualities ("unquenchable idealism," "operatively gentle") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The character's internal experience during negotiation lacks specificity—we get summary ("navigating the first breach") instead of concrete moment-to-moment choices under pressure. The emotional progression from hope to bittersweet acceptance follows a predictable arc without genuine struggle or cost visible in behavior.

    Silas's contradictory impulses—destroying ecosystems while secretly longing to preserve—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in his handling of the egg and decision to release it. The final renunciation is earned through prior causality showing his divided nature, with visible cost in abandoning his possession. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed and his sentimentality could be more embodied through specific gesture rather than stated traits.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to seek freedom is clear, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she moves with serene purpose rather than struggling between competing impulses. The "chaste courtesan" concept creates an interesting tension, yet her preservation of self reads more as accomplished fact than active struggle. Her final transformation arrives without sufficient dramatized cost or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's serenity and ethical commitment are consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied emotion during key moments. The "half-lit epiphanies" feel unearned—they arrive as declarations without dramatized struggle. His transformation of the radar dome and puppet shows reveal character through action, but peak moments lack the contradictory impulses and visceral stakes that would elevate beyond competent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's motivation to preserve overlooked histories manifests through concrete ritual actions of knotting silk threads and creating ephemeral structures. The character's internal experience layers effectively through embodied moments like "feeling a warm flush of purpose" and the "interrupted cadence of their own heartbeat." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "esoteric realist" that remains conceptual rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through "snowmelt ardor" and physical trembling. The transformation from guilt to purpose drives credible choices. Internal conflict between past failure and present determination creates authentic tension, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("driven by a purpose that had burned within her").

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's unique temporal condition creates genuine internal contradiction as she struggles to experience the present moment, with her "precisely playful" movements showing embodied character specificity. The final transformation feels earned through her journey, though some interior passages drift toward abstract philosophizing rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Anu's motivation is clear and rooted in his devotion to cosmic truth, with his internal conflict between empirical astronomer and mystic seeker playing out through concrete actions. The transformation from passive observer to active covenant-maker feels earned through his years of patient study. However, the emotional progression during the ritual itself lacks embodied contradiction—he experiences wonder but no genuine struggle or cost when accepting the covenant marks.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's transformation feels rushed - the cellular memory device delivers instant resolution without earned struggle. Elara functions more as exposition vehicle than active schemer, with her "scheming pacifist" trait told rather than dramatized through meaningful manipulation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mirror maker's motivation is clear and rooted in his family tradition and philosophical stance about boundaries, with his final choice to free rather than capture the dream showing genuine character evolution. However, the piece lacks embodied emotional contradiction during the transformation sequence, relying on procedural description rather than internal conflict, and the "synchronized breathing" technique feels more like mystical procedure than earned character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to reconnect with her daughter is clear and embodied through concrete actions like building the symbolic bridge. The internal conflict between her "feisty nature" and vulnerability shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, particularly when she discovers the ribbon. However, the daughter remains entirely off-page, limiting relationship-as-crucible potential, and some emotional beats rely on telling rather than embodied perception ("her endearingly feisty heart swelled with hope").

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear but relies on telling rather than embodied contradiction. The discovery-to-enlightenment arc feels rushed without sufficient internal conflict dramatized in scene. His "bewildered" characterization gets stated repeatedly but doesn't manifest in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to solve "ancient linguistic puzzles that had tormented her entire career" provides clear drive, and her resourcefulness manifests through concrete actions like decoding seventeen dialects. However, the rescued colleague lacks embodiment - we never see their consciousness struggling within the pages, reducing emotional stakes. The protagonist's internal experience during the rescue remains abstract ("speaking in dialects that could soothe angry text") rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's gift of experiencing others' memories as her own creates compelling internal contradiction, particularly when boundaries blur aboard the ship. The final choice to become chronicler is earned through accumulated memory encounters, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("blissfully aberrant") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and builds causally toward her choice to reconfigure the rope. However, her emotional state remains too controlled during peak discovery moments - she maintains "professional detachment" and "warmly methodical" approach even when confronting centuries-old mysteries, lacking the contradictory impulses that would make her feel fully human under such extraordinary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and drives concrete action, with decent embodied stress when maintaining the bloom of hush. However, the energy beings' transformation feels too convenient without sufficient internal conflict or cost to the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her retrocognitive gift and burden to restore meaning after collapse. The internal progression from daily ritual to revelation to action feels earned. However, the emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract ("heart filled with thistle-blown hope") and lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elthion's preemptive nostalgia manifests through concrete actions (pressing ear to crystals, tracing monument markings) and his final vow represents a genuine commitment with implied cost. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or struggle—his dedication never wavers, and no competing impulses complicate his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in his craft and purpose, with embodied details like "calloused fingers" and the physical weight of his tools. The character's "serious playfulness" manifests in concrete actions rather than labels. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped—we see his determination but little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation centers on intellectual quest rather than visceral pressure. While the jade cicada and tidal pool observations create texture, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - she contemplates rather than struggles. The warmly observant trait manifests but doesn't constrain choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict that drives her ascent, and her obsession with collecting silences provides unique motivation. However, the resolution lacks embodied emotional cost—her "reluctant descent" and transformation of her relationship to underground spaces is asserted rather than dramatized through specific sensory experience or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" drives concrete micro-choices through prism adjustments and passenger observation. His "fluidly logical mind" manifests in specific actions rather than labels, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("profound quiet that could, if guided properly, comfort even the most troubled heart").

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation as lore keeper protecting sacred knowledge is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains largely abstract ("excitement and apprehension"). The character operates competently without meaningful struggle or contradiction—she methodically completes each task without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal cost. The final renunciation of power for duty lands conceptually but lacks the visceral internal conflict that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shadow keeper's internal contradiction between isolation and duty creates genuine tension, particularly in "she had burned bridges carefully, the tender shadow keeper could not ignore the call that resonated in her bones." The final choice to help another is earned through the established pattern of her role. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("solitude she believed she craved") rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya's motivation to find the bolt is clear and rooted in her past trauma with the pyramid scheme, creating a coherent drive toward transformation. Her "virtuously mischievous" trait manifests in concrete actions like flouting safety rules for the greater good. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat linear without significant internal contradiction during the discovery sequence, and the final transformation lacks embodied struggle or cost beyond tears of joy.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to end the dynasty is clear and consistent, but lacks embodied emotional complexity during the key discovery moment. The character remains too controlled and analytical throughout, missing opportunities for contradictory impulses or genuine struggle when handling the gramophone.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Galen's withdrawal and search for forbidden knowledge establish clear motivation, with internal conflict between his knightly past and mystical pursuit creating genuine tension. The transformation at closure—from withdrawn knight to "guardian of spaces between realities"—is earned through specific experience with the marionette program. However, the piece relies on abstract declarations ("factually mystical nature") rather than fully embodied emotional states during peak moments, and Galen's internal experience during the reality-shift lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor's grief and methodology are well-embodied through concrete actions like studying dust patterns. The emotional progression from isolation to connection feels earned. However, Benjamin's characterization relies heavily on backstory summary rather than present embodiment, and some therapeutic language ("fractured souls") weakens peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by preserving erased histories against the Revisionists. Her internal state remains coherent through concrete details like clutching the key and working as a "quiet archivist" while secretly rebelling.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ethan's motivation to silence the prophecy is clear and drives action, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied—we see determination without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation motif is well-established through physical changes after each hush. The discovery of the moonstone creates a genuine choice moment with visible cost (strengthening earth connections). However, interiority relies on abstract descriptions ("mossy delight," "familiar sensation") rather than embodied contradictions, and the character lacks meaningful internal conflict during her pivotal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation from precision-obsessed to uncertainty-embracing is earned through concrete discovery, though interiority occasionally lapses into abstraction ("terrifying and liberating"). The compass responding to emotions provides embodied contradiction. Minor deduction for "uncertainly certain" feeling more like prompt language than natural thought.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deepens from searching for a lost artifact to understanding wisdom through failure. His internal arc from "luminous regret" to "luminous purpose" tracks well. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and Lumina remains more concept than character.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear (sister's trapped soul drives his unorthodox approach), and Thomas's fear of forgetting laughter creates genuine tension. However, Thomas appears late and his 73-year resistance dissolves too easily without dramatized struggle. The "modestly fearless" trait reads as label-only without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kai's trauma responses are embodied through sweat, tremors, and physical collapse, but the mathematical epiphany about mercy arrives without sufficient dramatized struggle. The proprioceptive enhancement creates interesting sensory detail yet doesn't generate meaningful internal contradiction or force difficult choices. Final realization feels unearned despite visceral opening.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clearly established through grandmother's teachings, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("between-worlds translator," "anchors of intuition") rather than embodied emotion. The final choice to "unfasten the barrier" lacks concrete dramatization of what this costs or means beyond metaphorical language.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus's ghost-seeing ability and technical expertise create a coherent character foundation with clear motivation. The interiority shows concrete particulars ("dust accumulation patterns," "vertical spaces and their secrets") rather than stock phrasing. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract—we understand his intellectual obsession but not the personal cost of his "weightless burden," limiting the character's full dimensional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eldon's motivation to "compress eternity into a single moment" drives consistent action, but his interiority relies on abstract declarations ("desperate longing," "liquefied past") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to reimagine civilization through poetic interpretation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from examining the shard to writing the manuscript.

However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed in the final gathering, and secondary characters lack distinct presence beyond functional roles.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has clear motivation rooted in his craft and heritage, with concrete embodied details like fingers dancing between gears. The internal conflict between preserving music and fighting the covenant of rust drives meaningful choices.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens through concrete details like the petrichor collection and psychometry ability.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elena's motivation remains surface-level throughout, with her transformation occurring through passive reception of visions rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in familial obsession, but the revelation lacks embodied struggle—she traces glass with fingertips but experiences no internal contradiction during discovery. The "dawning hush of understanding" arrives without dramatized resistance or cost, reading more as intellectual satisfaction than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ellara's internal journey from detached archivist to embodied witness shows clear motivation, but the transformation relies heavily on supernatural mechanics rather than earned psychological complexity. The retrocognitive episodes provide vivid embodiment ("searing reverie of teargas in her throat"), yet character agency remains reactive to the diary's power rather than driving choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elior's motivation to revive the town through alchemical principles is clear, but his internal journey from solitary practitioner to community catalyst feels too smooth - the epiphany about the amber bottle arrives without sufficient struggle. The story tells us about his "resisting false comfort" but this trait manifests more as declaration than embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation evolves credibly from archiving words to preserving emotional patterns, with the wax cylinder triggering genuine internal conflict. The third-grade memory functions as more than backstory—it actively changes his understanding of his role. However, some interiority edges toward explanatory ("archaeologist of human emotion, keeper of unintended prophecies") rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Anya's motivation crystallizes through the "biological clock striking midnight at forty-seven" and drives consistent action toward understanding borrowed time viscerally rather than abstractly. The "furious tranquility" paradox embodies throughout as she works with intense focus yet profound peace. Internal contradiction between her role as recorder versus participant resolves meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his patient dedication to analog methods creates genuine character texture. However, his internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene—he's too uniformly confident in his hypothesis. The final validation arrives without meaningful internal cost or struggle that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elion's spiritual curiosity and empathic connection drive his transformation, but the epiphany arrives through abstract telling ("the cosmic consciousness that permeated everything") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The recluse's transformation from isolated observer to active keeper of the covenant shows clear motivation rooted in their "tranquilly perceptive" nature, with the final choice to preserve silence carrying visible cost. Internal conflict between understanding the spirits and maintaining the covenant's requirements creates genuine tension. However, the character lacks embodied emotional specificity in crisis moments, relying on abstract descriptors like "astonished" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization relies heavily on abstract telling ("borrowed-time timekeeper") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.

Her progression from discovery to understanding lacks the embodied emotional struggle that would elevate beyond functional.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation to find beauty in the incomplete is clearly established, but she remains largely static—observing and recording rather than struggling with contradictory impulses.

Her internal experience lacks the embodied tension and flawed complexity that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his diagnosis, driving systematic work with copper wire despite physical deterioration. His "brazen calm" manifests consistently through action.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear but executed through abstract labels ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation from skeptic to believer lacks the intermediate struggle that would make it feel earned. His internal experience relies heavily on telling ("understanding cleansed Elian's mind") rather than showing the cost of this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and his specialized knowledge (dead languages, bird calls) drives concrete actions. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("narrow vastness" philosophy) rather than embodied, and the character lacks internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation builds coherently from retired tracker to active seeker, with his bloodhound perception skills driving the central decoding action. The preserved leaf as emotional anchor and practical tool creates layered motivation. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment of his exact perceptual abilities with Elara's encoding method, though the "arkadaş" reference suggests prior knowledge of his capabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's characterization relies heavily on told attributes ("blessed pariah," "temporally stretched perception") without embodied demonstration of how this gift manifests in specific perceptual moments. The final realization about "true north" being within arrives without earned causality—no prior struggle or choice builds to this insight. Some texture emerges through the sketching ritual and isolation, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "prove his worth" and "embrace the unknown" drives coherent choices, though the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene.

Character traits like "sacredly playful" feel more labeled than lived through specific micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation as a "historian of small gestures" drives consistent choices through walking patterns that unbind memories, with internal conflict between benevolence and ruthlessness creating authentic tension. The final choice to "merely exist in the space between memory and forgetting" shows earned endurance with visible cost. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("luminous absence—the feeling of presence within emptiness") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maven's motivation is clear and her transformation earned through the stone's discovery and nightly rituals. The internal journey from lost searcher to one who "carried home within her" tracks well.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tutor's motivation is clear but relies heavily on backstory exposition rather than embodied present-scene struggle.

    Marcel's uncertainty and obsessive need to "quilt memories together" drives credible internal conflict, with his forty-year dedication creating genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details (trembling fingers, tears blurring vision) and the earned renunciation of forgetting through his rediscovered art. The "intimately aloof" trait manifests in his relationship to the world through brushstrokes rather than conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his whisper-based theory drives the action, but interiority lacks specificity and embodiment. The emotional state during the crucial whisper moment ("with all the tenderness he could muster, yet with the intensity of a scream inside his heart") relies on abstract descriptors rather than concrete perception. The sister's response section feels perfunctory, lacking the texture that would make her recognition credible.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The navigator's motivation emerges through concrete actions (tracing the censer, building pathways, guiding ships) with embodied details like "fingers tracing edges" and "heart swelling." However, internal conflict remains largely implicit, and the character's personal stakes beyond duty lack specificity. The earned stasis at closure—continuing the cycle of guidance—carries visible purpose but limited personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like her voice "cracking from disuse" and the physical warmth of the relic during the ritual. The contradiction between her rational nature and desperate need for emotional barriers creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("involuntary truthfulness," "psychological safety") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to help others lands with earned emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's eccentric habits and isolation create a lived-in character, and his progression from observer to participant in the stranger's offering shows genuine change. The borrowed memories force contradictory impulses (his own life vs. the stranger's experiences) that play out through micro-choices. However, the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during the memory influx, and the final gesture feels slightly understated for the weight of connection claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation builds coherently from loneliness through mystical discovery to self-confrontation. The internal shift from passive map dealer to active choice-maker earns its cost through the doorway decision.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's transformation from disenchantment to purpose is earned through concrete experience in the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between anxiety and anticipation regarding Leo's secret drives the story, with her scientifically romantic perspective providing consistent character texture. The transformation from capturing light to capturing transformative moments shows earned change through the secret's impact. However, Leo remains underdeveloped beyond his role as secret-bearer, and some interiority tends toward abstract philosophical musing rather than embodied emotion ("the profound density of presence").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's fractured relationship with time and his multiple selves creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly in his jealousy of past versions who haven't seen their grave. The final choice to continue chronicling despite understanding the futility shows earned endurance with visible cost. However, some interiority relies on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation through sensory loss driving her new vocation is clear and embodied through specific actions like tracing clock pathways.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's crystallization affliction creates genuine stakes that compound under pressure, with embodied stress responses ("telltale prickle") and concrete coping mechanisms. The transformation of scars into protective wisdom earns its resolution through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("knowing that her strange affliction might activate").

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eloise's guilt and need for absolution drive clear, consistent motivation through concrete actions. The contradictory impulses between professional success and personal regret act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she handles the perfume bottle "with practiced hands" while seeking courage through whispered mantras. However, Beatrice remains somewhat underdeveloped beyond her forgiveness function, and the emotional arithmetic resolves too tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The witness's motivation to "unify scattered cosmic fragments" and "unravel cosmic illusions" is clearly stated but lacks embodied emotional stakes or internal contradiction. The character functions more as a conceptual vehicle than a person with genuine struggle—their translucent form literalizes this abstraction problem. No concrete cost appears in their choices; they simply execute their cosmic task without visible personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlo's motivation to understand time beyond mechanical measurement is clear and drives his experimentation with reversal. The internal shift from isolation to connection with silence shows genuine change, though the epiphany about time measuring "meaning not moments" arrives somewhat abstractly without sufficient embodied struggle in the reversal scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens from professional security to understanding connection, with her spatial gifts creating specific perceptual advantages. The transformation from viewing strangers as threats to recognizing them as predecessors shows earned change through concrete discovery. However, the "physics of letting go" motivation feels abstract and the emotional stakes could be more viscerally embodied during the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's characterization succeeds through specific contradictions (probability professor with gambler father) and embodied details like tracing the mica pane. However, her emotional progression feels too smooth—the leap from mathematical discovery to peace lacks intermediate struggle. The "lucid contradictions" she catalogues remain abstract rather than dramatized through conflicted choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "teach endings how to begin again" emerges through concrete action rather than assertion, with his estrangement clearly rooted in past loss.

However, the transformation feels somewhat mechanical—his shift from "patience rather than resistance" lacks the embodied struggle that would elevate the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like mixing powders and tracing the journal, with internal conflict between preservation duty and obsolescence anxiety. However, the emotional progression relies on stated abstractions ("haunted euphoria," "weight of small moments") rather than fully dramatized struggle, and the wife's death serves as convenient emotional ballast without earning its centrality to his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    Archie's loneliness drives the entire scheme, and his "desperately jocular" mask creates consistent character texture. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on summary ("profound loneliness that no amount of cheerful banter could dispel") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final community of believers provides closure but lacks a dramatized moment where Archie confronts the cost of his deception.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elion's motivation to navigate grief through finding the stillpoint is clear and drives choices, with his blindness creating genuine constraints. However, the emotional arc resolves too tidily—grief transforms to acceptance without showing the messy middle ground, and the epiphany arrives through abstract understanding rather than embodied struggle.

    Elara's guilt and determination are well-established through her "confidently uncertain" nature and the concrete mistake she's trying to correct. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—her emotions are more stated than viscerally felt through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's character achieves coherence through his role as translator of silence, with clear motivation rooted in his mother's legacy. The "joyful sorrow" contradiction manifests concretely in his work, though his interiority remains somewhat distanced. The final choice to continue despite being forgotten shows genuine cost, but the piece relies more on conceptual assertion than embodied emotion in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation to seek redemption is clear and consistent, driving her through the artistic trail to restore the portrait. However, the transformation from arsonist to archivist feels rushed without sufficient embodied struggle—her guilt is stated but not viscerally felt through concrete sensory details or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between compliance and rebellion drives consistent choices. The entangled consciousness with Theo creates genuine contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. However, characterization relies on some conceptual abstractions ("neural entanglement," "quantum connection") that distance us from embodied emotional reality, and the final reunion lacks the visceral cost that would elevate this to excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlo's motivation is clear and rooted in his expertise, with concrete embodied details like fingers brushing the zodiac coin. The challenge to Vance feels earned through established competence, though the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - we see confidence without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guardian shows consistent trait-driven behavior (methodical, silent, purposeful) but lacks internal contradiction or complexity. The visitor carries potential for conflict with their "half-spoken secret" but never acts on it, remaining passive. No genuine character change occurs - the guardian continues their work unchanged, the visitor leaves with secret intact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arthur's motivation to challenge rigidity is clear, but his special gift of hearing unspoken thoughts feels unearned and convenient rather than embodied through specific perception. The internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he moves too smoothly from concern to action without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara's yearning for transformation drives consistent choices through finding the scrimshaw to her final dissolution, with embodied emotion ("trembling fingers," "heart a battlefield"). The transformation from dock worker to one who embraces her true nature lands with visible cost—losing her former self and physical existence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("great emptiness in her chest") and the convenience of the scrimshaw appearing exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The performer's blank expression contrasted with theatrical narration creates a compelling internal contradiction, and his ritualistic whittling reveals character through embodied action. However, the motivation feels somewhat explained rather than dramatized through conflicted choices, and the "cultivate lightness in grief" arrives as summary rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's transformation reads more as abstract ascension than embodied struggle—"feeling themselves changing" and "expanding" lacks the concrete internal contradiction needed for higher bands. The motivation to "stride through boundaries" drives action but remains conceptually thin without visceral cost until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to restore beauty perception through indirect means shows complexity, and her "innocently cunning" nature manifests in how her botanical arrangements affect reality. The contradiction between her colorblindness and ability to see "variations in shades and tones that others missed" creates genuine intrigue. However, Gideon remains underdeveloped beyond his arthritic hands, and the emotional progression feels slightly managed rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist has clear motivation (discovering texture of connection through sound), but lacks internal contradiction or struggle—she moves through discoveries without meaningful resistance or cost. The character reads more as a vehicle for concept exploration than a complex individual facing difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with her grief-to-purpose transformation coherently tracked. However, the piece relies heavily on summary ("dedicated herself to helping others") rather than embodied moments of choice. The internal contradiction between loss and renewal exists conceptually but lacks scenic dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation as a pattern-seeker reverse-engineering cultural collapse is clear and consistent, with his "steadily curious" nature driving concrete actions like documenting readings and measuring card relationships. The visitor arrives as a credible secondary pressure point, though their interaction lacks the embodied emotional contradiction that would elevate this higher. Some passages lean toward diagnostic label-speak ("reverse engineering the cultural patterns") rather than fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to recover forbidden knowledge is clear and consistent, driving her patternless approach to the pagoda. The transformation from historian to "medium" shows earned change through accumulated experience. However, internal conflict remains mostly abstract ("anguished joy") without embodied contradiction in scene, and the emotional progression toward merger feels predetermined rather than struggled-for.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to catalog shadow anomalies while carrying "luminous regret" creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly when she recognizes her lost friend in the shadow. The final realization that she "meant to preserve the shape of hope" but understood "too late" demonstrates earned character cost through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her gentle nature consistent, but the internal conflict relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The chameleon interaction provides some concrete grounding, yet the transformation from "victim to survivor" feels declared rather than earned through specific micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation as a "closure seeker who opens wounds" drives the story coherently, though her transformation from opening to integrating wounds feels somewhat abstract rather than embodied. The telepathy with plants provides concrete sensory detail but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization. Her final realization carries thematic weight but arrives through summary ("she finally understood") rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's motivation to release stored love is clear and embodied through concrete psychometric actions. Her internal experience layers contradictory impulses (reverence vs. urgency) effectively. However, the piece relies on abstract concepts ("unused love," "spatially imaginative") without fully grounding them in physical struggle, and Elena faces no meaningful internal resistance to her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation centers on creative blockage from sensory overload, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene - we get summary of her struggle rather than witnessing competing impulses act simultaneously. The transformation from blocked to flowing creativity happens through abstract ritual rather than earned character work, with the epiphany arriving as declaration ("To free trapped creativity, she now understood...") rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guard's motivation to "cultivate sparks" drives consistent action through the piece, with internal contradiction between his dreamless state and emerging capacity for hope. His final admission "Perhaps I've begun" to dream shows earned change through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to "rediscover the wild frontier of his mind" drives consistent choices through translocation and exploration. The internal progression from questioning to wonder feels earned, though the epiphany about the forest being his consciousness projection arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characters remain ferry guides throughout with consistent "gentle persistence," though internal complexity emerges mainly through collective understanding rather than individual contradiction. The final realization about becoming "ferry guides of courage" shows earned transformation, but individual motivations beyond Maris remain underdeveloped. The dormant dragons as embodied courage provide concrete stakes, yet the piece lacks sharp internal conflict or visible character-specific costs.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bellhop's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail (trembling hands, phantom tingles) and his choice to sing despite incomplete healing carries visible cost. Internal contradiction between safety-seeking and the need for expression drives the closure, though some introspective passages lean toward summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's characterization works through accumulated details ("diminutive titan," "thousand years in her eyes") but lacks embodied emotion during peak moments. The revelation that the pretender is her own fear arrives without sufficient internal contradiction shown in scene. Her transformation from heir to guardian feels conceptually neat but emotionally unearned through prior dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood trauma, but her internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied in scene. The final choice to continue recording lacks visible cost—she simply returns to routine after her revelation. The "tapping rhythms" gesture repeats without revealing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" remains abstract throughout, never crystallizing into specific wants that drive concrete choices. The transformation from seeker to spiritual conduit happens through passive reception rather than earned struggle—she simply walks into the circle and receives enlightenment. Most critically, no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; she moves with unwavering purpose toward an inevitable apotheosis.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by the tension between tradition and evolution. The plant telepathy creates genuine internal contradiction when she discovers the prophecies she dismissed may be real.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's contradictory impulses manifest concretely through her daily ritual with the photograph and her somatic awareness of panic markers. The final choice to release the photograph is earned through accumulated particulars, though some therapeutic language ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") occasionally abstracts embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her internal struggle between artistic failure and renewal drives concrete actions. The piece shows contradictory impulses (despair vs. creative urge) acting simultaneously, particularly in her interaction with the tarot cards. However, the transformation relies heavily on abstract realization ("finding meaning in the fractured pieces") rather than embodied struggle, and the emotional progression feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tracker's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by childhood trauma around temporal perception during crisis. The "serene anger" emotional state feels specific though occasionally told rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's internal conflict between duty and revelation is clearly motivated and embodied through physical reactions (racing heart, automated breath stabilizers struggling). The character makes a decisive choice with visible stakes, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("weight of revelation") rather than concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhiannon's characterization relies heavily on telling rather than dramatized internal conflict. The story states she is "senselessly perceptive" and has "hunter-born instincts" but never shows these traits creating actual friction or choice. Her motivation to nurture rather than hunt lacks earned complexity—we see her working peacefully without witnessing the cost of choosing this path over her father's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fisher's motivation is clear and his unique ability to "transliterate emotions" drives the central action, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The character demonstrates patience and skill but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—his cool-headedness never wavers against competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear but relies heavily on abstract qualities ("devotedly observant eyes") and inherited purpose rather than embodied internal conflict. The character functions adequately as a truth-seeker but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization—she proceeds with methodical certainty rather than genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details (tracing patterns, listening to spectral wails). The guilt from his daughter's death drives credible choices, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("a guilt still fresh after ten years"). The final transformation from haunted to peaceful is earned through the amber-mediated connection.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's social perceptiveness drives his artistic intervention, with his choice to communicate through sand patterns rather than words showing consistent character logic. The transformation from individual understanding to collective acceptance feels earned through his specific actions, though some interior states rely on abstract descriptors ("lilac unease") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—rebuilding through empathy—but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score. The "retrocognitively trapped" attribute generates some internal tension between past and present, yet his choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted. His final act of renaming carries emotional weight but arrives without sufficient prior struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's synesthetic perception creates distinctive characterization, and his motivation to save the garden drives clear choices. The internal conflict between letting go and preserving connection resonates, though some emotional beats rely on abstract nostalgia rather than embodied contradiction ("Nostalgia washed over him").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation to help her brother drives clear choices, but her "affectionate skeptic" characterization relies on telling rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The shift from skeptic to believer occurs through assertion ("the affectionate skeptic became a believer") rather than earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation to understand and translate the unknown drives consistent choices throughout, with embodied sensory details like "fingers tingled with residual energy." The character demonstrates clear internal consistency and makes a meaningful choice to accept her role as translator, though the emotional complexity could deepen during the fossil encounter rather than accepting its purpose so readily.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and builds from solitary measurement to communal wisdom-sharing, but her internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aleksandr's internal conflict between his fractured spy identity and desire for authentic renewal drives meaningful choices, particularly his shift from coded messages to others to conversations with himself. The emotional progression from frozen paralysis to determined descent shows genuine struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman's motivation centers on maintaining "balance between worlds" through ritual stitching, but this remains abstract without embodied stakes or internal conflict. His "closely attentive" nature manifests through sensory observation yet never forces a difficult choice with visible cost. The piece gestures at generational duty and supernatural threshold-keeping but doesn't dramatize what failure would mean or why this specific morning matters.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his zen-potter mindset shapes his specific way of perceiving (hands forming circles, approaching with "sharp gentleness").

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" drives concrete action, and her wistfully pragmatic nature manifests in specific choices. The internal journey from solitary gardener to understanding her grandmother's legacy shows genuine progression.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her internal journey from fragmentation to wholeness tracks consistently. The "brittle awakenings" effectively embody her vulnerability, though some interiority relies on abstract declaration ("ancient beyond measure") rather than concrete embodiment. The final renunciation of control in favor of coexistence represents earned character change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but relies on summary ("For years, she had crafted intimate words for strangers") rather than embodied struggle. The thrush's nest moment provides a genuine micro-choice with tactile engagement, but her transformation lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization. The "inevitably whimsical" trait appears three times as a label without constraining specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her obsession drives consistent action, with good embodied stress (hair standing, breath held). However, interiority relies on telling ("cautiously hopeful nature") rather than showing through contradictory impulses in scene, and the resolution lacks the visceral cost of her isolation and sleeplessness established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia creating internal tension against her explorer identity works well, and her "prudently adventurous" dichotomy manifests in concrete hesitations. However, the emotional progression feels too smooth - her lifelong claustrophobia simply "fades" at the crucial moment without sufficient internal struggle. The motivation is clear but the transformation lacks the messy complexity of genuine psychological breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's face-blindness creates a compelling character premise with clear motivation for her investigative method, but internal conflict remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in scene. The story declares her unique qualification but doesn't dramatize how her condition creates specific investigative advantages through concrete choices under pressure. Her final insight about the assistant arrives through inference rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eli's motivation builds coherently from family duty to scientific obsession, with the copper nail serving as both talisman and key. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract ("spongey dread," "nervous confidence") without embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias has clear motivation rooted in his brother's rejection and musical legacy, but his transformation relies heavily on abstract mystical events rather than earned psychological development.

Interior life consists mainly of observations and wonderment rather than conflicting impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias maintains consistent characterization with his "perceptively calm" trait driving choices throughout, and his final realization about paths circling back carries genuine weight. However, Marcus remains underdeveloped as mere antagonistic pressure, and some interiority relies on abstract labels ("polished calm," "perceptively calm") rather than embodied complexity. The protagonist's renunciation of his father's path feels earned through accumulated detail, though peak moments lack visceral emotional embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization relies heavily on role-based traits ("lucid dream chronicler") rather than embodied contradictions. The healing-with-words ability appears only as exposition without visible cost or constraint on her choices. Dr. Thorne functions more as plot device than pressure-applying character.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    The druid's motivation to save her mentor is clear but lacks internal contradiction or complexity during the ritual itself. The transformation from "guarded" to accepting truth shows some arc, but emotional states remain too controlled throughout—no genuine struggle between impulses. The mentor's centuries-old deception provides backstory depth, yet the druid's response lacks the messy, contradictory emotions such a revelation would provoke.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The visionary's motivation feels abstract and conceptual rather than embodied through concrete choices under pressure. While the piece attempts internal conflict through "anxious elation" and being "root-bound," these remain labels without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation at closure lacks the earned causality needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied actions ("fingers traced the gnarled tree roots") and consistent trait manifestation, with her "fierce gentleness" constraining her approach to the memory-trammeling. The reckless idealist trait drives her choice to barter destinies, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the memory confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details ("handled it with a reverence born from his years on the road") and his expert knowledge creating authentic interiority. The internal conflict between shame and passion plays out through his interaction with the cloth. However, some passages drift into summary ("the loss that had preceded his professional downfall") rather than maintaining scene pressure, and the "echo valley" metaphor feels forced when repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her methodical nature manifests in concrete actions, but internal conflict remains largely abstract ("both exhilarated and terrified").

Her final sense of purpose arrives without visible cost or genuine internal wrestling.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    The librarian's identity migration tied to lunar phases provides an intriguing premise, but characterization remains conceptual rather than embodied. The transformation sequence ("Who emerged when the tide receded hours later was neither the archivist nor the story-weaver") tells rather than shows the internal experience. No genuine struggle or contradiction acts within the scene—the character accepts everything with serene wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inspector's transformation from endings-checker to hope-harbinger shows clear motivation rooted in discovery, with embodied reactions ("trembling fingers," "warmth spread through her hands").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (transcribing graffiti, following cryptic directions), with genuine internal conflict between medication-numbed safety and raw confrontation with grief. The brother's death provides earned causality for her journey. However, some interiority relies on abstraction ("warehouse of memories," "terrain of her own soul") rather than embodied specificity, and the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear (seeking the library) but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during the quest. The character experiences revelations but no meaningful cost or renunciation occurs on-page; they simply transcribe findings and leave. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("willing its words to enter their body") rather than concrete, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in preserving knowledge against empire dominion. The plant telepathy creates genuine internal texture, particularly the desert rose's "wordless anxiety" and final "shrieked" concept of propagation. However, the emotional arc relies somewhat on stated stakes rather than embodied struggle, and the "mulberry ache" remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation (failing to save her sister) provides clear emotional grounding, and her methodical work with the deceased woman shows consistent character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's characterization achieves professional depth through specific details (the wind chime methodology, "sincerely insincere demeanor") and embodied contradiction between his professional detachment and protected vulnerability. The fisherman remains underdeveloped as mere catalyst. Internal conflict manifests through concrete objects and rituals rather than abstract introspection, though the final moment where "the cloak of doubt slipped slightly" feels slightly unearned given the limited pressure applied to Elian himself.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's transformation from confusion to understanding provides a clear arc with embodied moments ("brow furrowed, then suddenly cleared"), but Elien remains more concept-delivery vehicle than character. The withholding of truth creates genuine tension that pays off when Maya demands "Show me," though both characters lack the contradictory impulses and specific flaws that would elevate beyond functional.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation remains abstract throughout - his centuries of waiting and reverence never manifest in concrete internal conflict or embodied emotion. The story relies on telling us about his "weathered resolve" and "tears carving clean paths" without showing the specific impulses driving him. His final transformation lacks earned causality because we never see him struggle with contradictory desires or make difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to find wonder beyond automated magic is clear and consistent, driving his journey to the garden folly. His transformation from underachieving mage to "pioneer of impossible wonders" feels earned through the concrete act of unstrapping his regulation pack and accepting the keystone's luminance. However, interiority relies on abstract statements ("yearned to find the sacred in the simple") rather than embodied contradiction, and the emotional texture during his transformation lacks specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Hemingway's synesthesia creates a distinctive interiority with concrete sensory crossings ("harbor waves are indigo"). His choice to enter the portal and make the luminous vow demonstrates agency with visible cost (the permanent shimmer on his palm), though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the library sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Loran's motivation is clear and consistent - his "quiet enthusiasm" sustains him through preparation while others experience "stellar doubt." The internal stakes feel genuine, though the cosmic scale creates some abstraction. The final choice lands with earned causality, but emotional embodiment remains somewhat thin during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The reaper's motivation to name nameless fears after losing Elara is clear and consistent, driving his actions throughout. Internal conflict between eternal duty and mortal love creates genuine tension. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and "heartbroken reaper" relies on archetype without sufficient embodied particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mage's earnest naivety drives believable choices, particularly his persistence despite "lukewarm" powers. His motivation remains consistent throughout, though the transformation from lukewarm to warming powers feels slightly unearned. The character's humility ("Magic was never my strong suit") creates authentic vulnerability that grounds the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thomas's motivation to preserve truth and honor the displaced is clear and consistent, with his aunt's revelation providing earned causality for his final choice. The internal conflict between his role as warden and emerging awareness works, though the epiphany arrives somewhat suddenly. His "precisely humane" trait manifests in concrete actions, and the final decision to expose the false narrative carries visible professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to harmonize logic and intuition is clear and drives the ritual, but her internal complexity remains largely told ("secretly sentimental") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pattern seeker's internal experience remains abstract, lacking embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. "The watcher's burden had never felt heavier" and "heart quicken with dread" are label-only feelings without specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's emotional numbness creates clear internal contradiction against her need to vivify the brain through feeling, and her final choice to embrace sensation carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "safeguard space for innovation" reads as abstract thesis rather than embodied need. The character remains conceptual—we get her role and philosophy but no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle beyond examining a seed. Her "notably receptive mind" functions as a label without creating actual character pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and the "mournfully eager" contradiction plays throughout, but his internal state relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("desperate need," "grief," "sorrowful") rather than embodied perception. The single giggle provides a micro-choice moment, but the response lacks specificity—he "froze mid-sway" is generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guardian's motivation to "make friends with uncertainty" manifests through consistent waiting and the practice of interiorizing exteriors, but remains largely conceptual without embodied emotional contradiction.

    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his family's stifling destiny, with concrete embodied details like "weathered hands" and "bare feet feeling every crack." The transformation from hopeless to hopeful tracks causally through successive attempts. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "alchemist's soul" and "stoically sensitive nature" without sufficient embodied contradiction in scene, and the emotional progression feels too smooth for such a momentous break with tradition.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent ("find the beginning in every ending"), but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she moves through the tuning process without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to descend feels predetermined rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liam's motivation to merge timelines stems from a compelling childhood fracture across realities, but his emotional state remains too steady throughout—lacking the contradictory impulses and degraded thinking under extreme stress that such a momentous convergence would demand. The "resiliently positive" trait reads as a label rather than embodied behavior creating friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to find his sister through dream architecture is clear and emotionally grounded, with concrete embodiment in his manipulation of sinew threads. The internal conflict between artistic ambition and personal longing drives credible choices. However, the sister's appearance feels somewhat convenient, and emotional progression in the reunion lacks the contradictory complexity expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to bridge cosmic and oceanic realms is clear and consistent, driving his development of edge geometry. His internal journey from isolation to connection earns the final stance, though some transitions between doubt and breakthrough feel compressed. The anchor chain link serves as a concrete focal point for his character-specific obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her grandmother's unresolved warning. The child character serves functional plot purpose but lacks depth. Internal conflict between routine closure work and urgent danger creates genuine tension, though some emotional beats feel slightly prescribed rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to guide the unremembered is rooted in her brother's disappearance and manifests through concrete actions, though internal contradictions remain mostly told rather than enacted. The claustrophobia trait creates genuine tension against her duty but could be more embodied during peak moments. Her final choice to continue this work "until her own time came" shows earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    The digital ghost consciousness premise creates intriguing contradictory impulses (counting heartbeats while being bodiless), but the character's motivation feels abstract rather than embodied. The choice to defragment memories and find wisdom lacks visceral stakes or cost—the character seems to drift through realizations rather than struggle with them.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The storyteller's motivation is clear and consistent, driving concrete actions throughout. However, internal conflict remains largely absent—he pursues his goal without meaningful contradiction or struggle. The character reads more as a vehicle for the concept than a complex individual facing genuine internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation shifts from academic curiosity to witnessing wonder, but this transformation lacks embodied emotional struggle and relies on summary ("their motivation gradually shifting"). The character's internal contradictions remain abstract rather than acting simultaneously in scene. The final acceptance of wonder over bitterness needs more dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elayn's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and consistent throughout, driving her descent to the orchard and the theft of the sapling. The transformation at the end shows genuine change with visible cost (the orchard's sigh of release, the statues stirring). However, internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously within scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as a "respectfully rebellious" mailman using his position to reunite families is clear and consistent, with embodied tension when guards enter the arcade. The woman's trembling hands and whispered hope about her daughter create genuine emotional stakes. However, the daughter subplot feels underdeveloped—we learn she exists only at line 15, weakening the emotional architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carpenter's twenty-year silence and motivation to find meaning in discarded things establishes clear character foundation, with the singing moment showing contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire). However, the transformation from silence to song feels somewhat rushed without sufficient embodied struggle, and the resolution lacks the granular cost that would elevate characterization—we see magical transformation but not personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margaret's characterization succeeds through consistent embodied details (tracing patterns, adjusting the scarf) and her "sanely eccentric" nature manifests in concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, with her obsessive pursuit embodied through concrete actions (pre-dawn photography, basement alchemy).

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority during the mental unlocking sequence. The woman's struggle between genius and fear creates genuine internal conflict, though her presence is mostly abstract until the mental chamber scene. The resolution—her touching the starlit thread and freeing the idea—is earned through Silas's specific actions, with visible cost in the dissolution of the hair strands.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to recover stolen memories drives consistent choices through concrete actions like daily visits and star-chart documentation. The contradiction between her scholarly skepticism and persistent searching creates authentic tension. However, the resolution's convenience—memories simply returning through mushroom touches—lacks the earned causality and visible cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like trembling hands and backward walking, while Prisha's progression from nervous finger-spilling to focused annotation earns her transformation. The "combative tenderness" teaching style manifests in contradictory impulses. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "resilience" motivation that could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pruner's motivation ("to preserve the color of wonder") is clear but remains abstract throughout. Her transformation of the seed shows agency, yet internal conflict is told ("insatiably creative fire") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character reads more as archetype than individual - no specific flaws or blind spots complicate her mystical work.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation to ground restless spirits through her unique attribute of accumulating silence is clear and drives concrete action. The internal contradiction between being a restorer while personally broken creates authentic tension. However, Jacob's character remains underdeveloped beyond his function as secret-bearer, and some emotional transitions (Elena's subtle shift feeling "one tiny section of her own damage repaired") feel slightly unearned given the limited dramatization of her healing process.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's methodically curious nature drives concrete choices throughout, particularly in her frame-by-frame video analysis and map overlay work. Her motivation to "interpret silence with empathy" manifests in specific actions rather than remaining abstract. However, the character lacks embodied emotional contradiction during discovery moments, and the final realization arrives somewhat smoothly without sufficient internal resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique ability to perceive boundaries between worlds, driving her investigation. The internal shift from historical inquiry to personal understanding of grief feels earned through concrete discovery. However, the "medium-historian" concept and her accident backstory remain somewhat abstract, lacking the embodied specificity that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation rooted in childhood silence creates genuine emotional grounding, and her empathy for unexpressed needs drives coherent choices. However, the ghost lacks embodied presence beyond concept, and Elara's internal conflict remains told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's warmly inquisitive nature drives her investigation credibly, and her shift from professional detachment to understanding carries genuine emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her obsession with proving atmospheric consciousness drives the story, but internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied in scene. The final realization about memorializing connection itself feels unearned—she observes clouds and takes notes but makes no difficult choice that costs her anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's face blindness creates a compelling internal logic that drives her unique artistic method and discovery. The contradiction between her disability and profession generates authentic tension, particularly in how she compensates through pattern recognition. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract realization about "patterns of souls" which edges toward conceptual summary rather than embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's curiosity drives consistent observation and pattern-seeking, but his emotional state remains largely static despite the magnitude of discovery. The transformation from apprentice to discoverer lacks embodied emotional complexity - we get "trembling fingers" and "heart racing" but these are stock responses that don't capture the specific texture of this character's breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent - Elias seeks the rhythm of repair from grandfather's fragmented journal.

    Elion's altruistic motivation is consistent but lacks embodied complexity—he operates as a benevolent force without internal contradiction or cost. The ghost's noncorporeal limitations create some tension, yet his emotional state remains static throughout. Aris functions more as a plot device than a character with her "strangely trustworthy nature" told rather than dramatized through specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action with the puppet head against the spindle. The "cold and constant" burning to preserve existence against entropy creates genuine stakes. However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("nested patterns," "liquid shadow") without sufficient grounding in felt emotion during the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistent but operates at a functional level - he protects the orchard due to obligation, then saves travelers out of duty. The internal conflict between burden and purpose emerges but lacks embodied contradiction in scene. His "graceless beauty" movements and the final transformation from burden to blessing show character evolution, though the emotional progression feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's internal transformation from isolation to reconnection is well-motivated through concrete scientific parallels, with her grief and professional focus creating genuine contradiction. The phone call to her sister shows meaningful change earned through the ravine meditation. However, the resolution feels slightly neat—the sister's immediate receptiveness lacks the friction that would elevate the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vendor's motivation to "find the place where stories begin" drives consistent choices through handling memory shards and moonlight bottles, culminating in the earned realization that stories exist "in the spaces between."

The character's past fragmentation of tales creates genuine stakes for their careful new approach.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is clear and his gift creates genuine internal conflict, but the character remains largely static through the story with no meaningful change or earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elena's motivation to heal community division is clear but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The character operates more as a benevolent facilitator than someone with genuine stakes or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The engineer's motivation to become "archeologist of abandoned dreams" drives consistent choices through neural interface activation and memory excavation, with visible cost in identity blurring.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks embodied emotional complexity during key moments. The character operates more as a vehicle for plot mechanics than a conflicted individual, with internal states described through labels ("heart beating with the rhythm of a latent blaze") rather than embodied perception. The final choice to continue the cycle lacks visible personal cost beyond accepting responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied responses to the discovered music. The emotional progression from ritual gratitude through discovery to tears feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to understand empathy through vibrational frequencies is clear and consistent, driving her experimental approach to the diary. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("Empathy is the bridge between frequencies") rather than embodied emotional states, and the transformation at closure—shifting from cataloging silence to teaching—lacks sufficient causal pressure from the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand the corpse flower seed is clear and consistent, driving her actions throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eira's synesthetic gift creates genuine specificity through embodied perception ("indigo rippled outward, visible to her as a wave of deepest navy"). The motivation to "certify wonder as essential" drives concrete action, though internal conflict remains somewhat abstract. The final choice to complete the composition lands with communal transformation, but individual cost to Eira herself feels understated.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transposed empathy gift creates genuine internal contradiction as she coldly dissects emotion while craving understanding, and Thomas's borrowed personality manifests through embodied actions (examining drawers, adopting posture). The ethical ambiguity of her invasive research methods remains unresolved without safety-hedging. Deduction for some diagnostic label-speak ("emotional matrices," "mathematics of emotion") in peak moments without sufficient embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ayla's transformation from jittery courier to confident wonder-awakener is earned through accumulated encounters, with the pendant serving as catalyst. The internal shift from dependence on the artifact to embodying its essence shows genuine growth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal tension between skepticism and belief creates some depth. However, the emotional embodiment relies on telling ("her breath visible," "burned bright") rather than complex contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to carry her grandmother's message drives consistent action, with embodied details like "touching the amber bead each evening, feeling its warmth strengthen."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orion's transformation from meek blacksmith to sought-after craftsman is well-motivated through the magician's silk bargain, with clear internal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The map maker's motivation crystallizes clearly through action—trembling fingers, dream-driven searching, persistent determination—with embodied responses to the shard's power.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation from reticent observer to participant in the keeper tradition shows clear motivation, with the "luminescent ache of loneliness and kinship" embodying contradictory impulses.

    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization relies heavily on exposition rather than embodied emotion. The "laughing storm herald" trait appears as a label without showing how laughter manifests under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eliza's motivation to "find the sacred in the ordinary" drives her actions consistently, though internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than embodied.

    Elara's motivation is consistent and rooted in her role as bell tuner, but interiority remains largely abstract ("heightened perception," "feverish diligence").

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit 734's internal conflict between mechanical nature and organic responses creates genuine tension, especially in the decision to fragment itself. The "містул memory circuits" typo and some abstract emotional labeling ("nostalgia, though technically impossible") weaken otherwise strong characterization. The final transformation earns its cost through prior setup of the android's paradoxical nature.

    Leo's motivation to connect the community through solving the locket mystery is clear and builds naturally. The final choice to display the letters publicly rather than seek individual ownership shows genuine character development with visible community cost/benefit.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to decrypt vulnerability as strength is established but relies heavily on summary rather than embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to find deleted memories is grounded in the specific loss of her brother, and her actions follow consistent internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's guilt and need for redemption drive clear, consistent choices, particularly the blood signature that costs him his anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist has clear motivation (learning why some echo) that evolves to helping a specific spirit, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction - mostly told through abstract concepts. The transformation from curiosity to compassion feels earned but the character remains more archetype than individual, lacking specific flaws or blind spots that complicate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mapper's motivation to restore patience through celestial observation is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The character operates more as a vehicle for thematic exploration than a person facing genuine conflict—their dedication never wavers, no doubts surface, and the "patient revolution" proceeds without personal cost. The piece tells us about "sculpting patience from impatience" but never shows the mapper wrestling with their own impatience or facing a moment where their mission might fail.

    Maya's internal conflict between professional constraints and personal liberation is well-established through the lantern discovery and her "fortified vulnerability."

    Elena's transformation from seeking death to finding renewed purpose is well-motivated through concrete experiences, though her initial state "gripped reality loosely" remains abstract. The final choice to stay is earned through accumulated insights about endings/beginnings, with visible cost in abandoning her original intent. Internal contradictions operate throughout (seeking death while volunteering to help others), but peak moments rely on abstracted realizations ("fold in patience," "transformation—a becoming") rather than embodied struggle.

    The protagonist remains psychologically static despite handling the burned letter repeatedly—no contradictory impulses act in scene, only retrospective summary. The "gentle persuasion" trait is declared but never constrains or enables specific choices. Internal conflict exists only as abstract reflection about "destined mismatches" without embodied struggle or micro-choices that reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The line walker's motivation to preserve wisdom is clear and consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("echo of wisdom," "liminal spaces") without concrete embodiment. The character's "strange honesty" manifests only as narrative assertion rather than through dramatized choices under pressure. No meaningful change or cost is visible—the ritual completes without struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara's character remains static throughout - her "perceptively calm" nature never wavers or gets tested under pressure, and she functions more as a facilitator than a protagonist with internal conflict. The group members who arrive are undifferentiated and lack individual characterization. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; the ending merely confirms what Elara already knew about her work.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scholar's motivation is consistent but lacks embodied emotional complexity, relying on abstract declarations like "weathered innocence" rather than concrete contradictory impulses. The character's internal conflict never manifests as simultaneous opposing desires in scene—he simply proceeds with unwavering dedication. His discovery moment ("the reticent scholar understood that his work was not about preservation but translation") arrives as unearned epiphany rather than through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prophet's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices, particularly in his determination to remember before forgetting. The final moment of "committing the sound to memory one last time before it slipped away" shows earned acceptance of his condition's cost. However, the caretaker remains underdeveloped beyond her functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation coheres around her role as someone who perceives what others miss, with her "ache" for transcendence embodied consistently. However, her epiphany about "resonance" arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient struggle, and the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's serene composure and Mr. Anders' specific request for "no tears, just music" create believable motivations. The son's whispered promise to "fix it when you're feeling better" shows genuine contradictory impulses—hope against knowledge. However, Mrs. Anders remains underdeveloped beyond exposition, and some interiority tends toward abstraction ("fragments of love, memory, and music").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her scholarly dedication consistent, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her discovery unfolds too smoothly without genuine struggle or cost. The "quietly deliberate" trait manifests in action but never complicates her choices. The final transformation from scholar to explorer happens without earned causality or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and grounded in her "forgiving skeptic" nature, with concrete embodiment through her bone-setting inheritance and the physical handling of the changeling tooth. The final choice to practice bone-setting "on the air between them" shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, Arthur's characterization remains vague—neither fully the lost child nor the otherworldly being—and his dialogue ("Building...turning mistakes into constellations") reads as thematic echo rather than authentic voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is consistent and her acceptance of earthbound limitation shows genuine character evolution. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction - her emotions are told rather than felt through specific sensory details. The transformation from wistfulness to purpose lands but needed more visceral struggle in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal journey from guilt to acceptance is earned through concrete embodied details like tracing the amber pendant and studying moss patterns. The final choice to leave the pendant as offering demonstrates clear agency with visible cost. However, some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("stages of grief and acceptance") and the transformation feels slightly too tidy for the complexity established.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The novelist's internal conflict between artistic vision and commercial expectations provides clear motivation, but execution relies heavily on abstract declarations rather than embodied contradiction. The character's final transformation from "conflicted" to peaceful feels unearned through dramatized struggle—we're told about his decade-long journey but witness only contemplative observation. The "collect the shapes of different hopes" metaphor attempts depth but remains conceptually vague without concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore sacred practices emerges clearly from the vine's visions, and her transformation from solitary tinkerer to community healer tracks causally. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped - she experiences no meaningful doubt or contradiction during her quest, reducing complexity. The final choice to lead the ceremony lacks visible personal cost beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist operates with clear purpose and methodical patience, but remains emotionally opaque throughout. While the physical deliberateness is shown through careful arrangement of objects, we never access genuine interiority or contradiction—the character functions more as archetype than individual. The final transformation lacks earned emotional cost despite its cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's peripherally focused perception drives her unique approach to the timer, and her patient methodology reveals character through action. The transformation from broken mechanism to renewed harvest shows earned change with visible cost (weeks of meticulous work). However, interiority relies on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction, and emotional states remain told rather than felt through specific sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The weaver's internal journey from seeing their boundary-less existence as curse to gift provides a genuine arc with embodied details like "brass fittings warm against their fingers." However, the transformation feels somewhat unearned—the vision of bronze towers triggers the shift without sufficient prior causality, and emotional states remain too controlled during the burden-collecting ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara's grief-driven carving shows strong internal contradiction between preservation and release, with embodied emotion through tactile wood-working. The "hauntingly practical" trait manifests concretely in measuring distances and transforming loss into creation. Minor deduction for the Chinese character typo ("指纹") breaking immersion and slight over-articulation in the final paragraph's emotional summary.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Cyrus's motivation is clear and rooted in decades of searching, with embodied details like his "permanently bent" back and "trembling hands." The negotiation with his ghost provides a meaningful change with visible cost (dissolving the camera wheel), though the ghost's acceptance feels slightly unearned given minimal dramatized interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her "functionally creative" trait manifests in concrete actions, but her emotional state remains static throughout - no internal contradiction or cost visible when she succeeds. The character reads more as a vehicle for thematic exploration than a complex individual facing genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal journey from resignation to renewed purpose is clearly motivated through concrete memories and the crystal encounter. The bear's presence feels unmotivated—it appears without causal connection to Elias's conflict. The transformation lands but the external catalyst (bear) lacks grounding in character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her grandfather's legacy, but internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied. The character makes no meaningful choices under pressure—she simply finds what she came for without obstacles or cost. Her emotional response to discovery ("serene upheaval") is asserted rather than earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seed collector's patient observation drives meaningful choices, particularly in his strategic approach to the fisherman. His motivation to preserve ancient methods creates clear stakes. However, internal conflict remains understated—we see patience but limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The traveler's motivation is consistently rooted in his survivor's guilt and need to process loss through writing obituaries for the living. His internal contradiction between projection of presence and avoiding true presence creates genuine tension. However, the final turn toward writing his own obituary, while earned, relies on some abstract emotional progression ("something beautiful and painful was beginning to heal") rather than fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elorian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving him to attempt the device assembly with visible cost when it fails. His internal conflict between hope and despair plays out concretely through action. However, interiority sometimes relies on abstract phrasing ("bitter sweetness filled Elorian's heart") rather than embodied sensation, and the final determination feels slightly unearned given the depth of his preceding failure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation to transform her father's destructive legacy into something nurturing is clear and drives consistent choices throughout. The internal contradiction between her heritage and calling creates genuine tension, though some emotional beats rely on telling rather than embodied experience ("unyielding compassion," "scars can sing"). Her choice to protect the grafted roses under fire demonstrates values hierarchy with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "luminous skepticism" and "realistically imaginative nature" create consistent internal texture, and her transformation from skeptic to believer earns the closure. However, the character lacks embodied emotional complexity during peak moments—her three-day search and final liberation feel procedurally smooth rather than viscerally conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    The sentimentalist operates more as a cosmic archetype than a character with internal conflict. While its mission creates consistent motivation, there's no embodied emotion or genuine struggle—it succeeds without meaningful resistance or cost. The being never faces internal contradiction about its purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to honor collective grief through stone carving is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during key moments.

His emotional progression jumps too quickly from meticulous isolation to collective wisdom without sufficient intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistent and his tender, methodical nature drives the ritual of decoding the tapestry.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but remains external—saving villagers—without internal contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The copyist's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving stories through dust particles—but the character remains static throughout, lacking internal contradiction or meaningful change.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena's motivation centers on capturing/preserving the ephemeral through art, with consistent internal conflict between safety-seeking and acceptance of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    Milo's motivation to preserve knowledge is consistent but remains largely intellectual without embodied emotional cost. His "abrasive calm" and "rationally rebellious" nature are told more than dramatized through specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—rebellion through food memory—with good embodied details like "fingers tingling."

The character reads as a vehicle for theme rather than a fully realized individual with genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict and drives key plot turns, particularly in revealing the maintenance supervisor's motivations.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria's motivation to understand living houses is clear and consistent, but her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction—she observes and collects methodically without genuine struggle or cost. The revelation about houses holding "pieces of those who'd loved them" arrives as unearned epiphany rather than through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The statue's telepathic consciousness and the diver's internal journey are well-developed with clear motivations rooted in seeking understanding beyond certainty. However, the diver remains relatively passive, receiving wisdom rather than making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's "grim optimism" is stated repeatedly but rarely embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter's motivation is clear and her methodical hopefulness manifests in systematic research, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction - she experiences daydreams and visions without genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guide's motivation to preserve dying arts and Khira's fierce resistance create clear, rooted drives that compel the closure choice. The "bread remembers" mantra and her defiant baking of initials embody internal conflict well. Minor deduction for the guide's somewhat passive role until the lens gift.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Esme's motivation to defy fate is consistent and embodied through concrete actions with the clock-making and puzzle-solving.

Her transformation at closure feels earned through accumulated detail rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's fear-transformation arc is coherent with embodied reactions ("skin crawl while drawing me deeper"), though the revelation of the whispering advisor as future-self feels somewhat convenient. The photographic curse provides a concrete constraint that shapes perception throughout. Internal contradiction appears in the simultaneous repulsion/attraction dynamic, earning points for complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prophet's motivation to transform obstacles into instruments is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or compelling cost.

    Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during her discovery.

    The surveyor's "stoically sensitive" contradiction manifests through concrete actions—plunging into cold water, carefully documenting memories, placing notes in repairs. His motivation crystallizes through accumulated details rather than dramatic turns, though the internal complexity could deepen beyond the archeologist metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his methodical nature consistent, but interiority remains largely abstract ("tranquilly perceptive nature," "logical mind appreciated") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (polishing gems, folding cranes), with grief manifesting as "luminous torment."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation as a trauma survivor seeking purpose is clear, but his internal experience lacks embodied specificity and relies on abstract descriptors like "bleak exhilaration" and "strange cocktail of grief and purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation as a negotiator seeking wisdom from mistakes is clear, but her internal contradictions remain too abstract ("emotional dimensions alongside the practical").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, with concrete embodied details like tracing the compass edge and feeling regrets "like mist rolling in." The internal conflict between self-forgiveness and persistent guilt operates throughout, though the final transformation to "student of the sea again" feels slightly unearned given the limited on-page struggle—dolphins appearing doesn't fully justify the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "kindle empathy" remains abstract throughout, never embodied in specific choices or conflicts. The time-loop revelation arrives without earned emotional cost—the character accepts their fate too easily. Internal states rely on labels ("jaded wonder," "trembling hands") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliora's motivation is clear and her metamorphosis carries genuine internal conflict ("becoming less human meant losing part of what made her love"). The transformation sequence embodies change viscerally through eyes becoming "pools of night sky" and feet growing roots. However, the brother remains more archetype than individual, and some emotional beats lean toward therapy-speak ("love transcends form").

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation centers on time anxiety after motherhood, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("willingly perplexed," "choking beauty") rather than embodied emotion.

    The vagrant poet's personality molting creates genuine internal complexity, and his mission carries embodied purpose through concrete actions like rebuilding shelves and scattering seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pianist's motivation crystallizes through concrete details (broken clock ticking backwards, daughter's death) and his "steely longing" manifests in purposeful action.

    Elena's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with micro-choices (collecting dust, documenting changes) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. Her motivation shift from cosmic to terrestrial is earned through specific on-page struggle, and the final stance of "witnessing and honoring" feels credible and costs her previous professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena's characterization is strong, with her "steadily adaptive" nature demonstrated through concrete actions like the frost plate experiment. Her motivation to uncover the truth is clear and intensifies believably. However, a minor flaw exists: her core motivation ("to discover purpose in the pauses") is more told than fully dramatized in the choices of this specific scene, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, compelling her high-stakes artistic quest. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the weight of the tuning fork case and her reborn feeling in the conservatory. The diagnostic phrase "heat-mapping emotions" is a minor slip, but it is quickly dramatized through action, minimizing the impact. Her final joy and purpose feel earned by her on-page struggle and discovery.

    Elias's characterization is concrete and embodied, with his weariness and stubborn persistence driving his choices. His motivation to "give rest a permanent address" is dramatized through his actions, culminating in a credible renunciation of his old life.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. His final declaration is a credible endurance earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her spiritual curiosity, compelling her to seek "where unused love is stored." Her transformation from a "pilgrim of sparks" to a "keeper of light" is earned through on-page micro-choices, particularly her conscious decision to shift her breathing. The final renunciation of capturing the moment is a credible endurance with a felt cost. However, her internal contradiction is more stated than dramatized under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of time" is a consistent, driving force that compels her high-stakes choices. Her internal conflict between terror and intoxication during the reverie is embodied and specific. However, her final choice to merge with the garden, while thematically resonant, feels slightly more conceptual than causally earned by her prior micro-choices, preventing a higher score.

    Kael's obsession is a clear, compelling motive that intensifies under the pressure of his diagnosis.

    Lillian's motivation is clear and specific, rooted in a desire to understand her unique ability rather than material gain. Her internal conflict is shown through her actions and the final reinterpretation, which is a credible and earned renunciation of her thief identity. The final choice to preserve light is a meaningful change scaled to the length, with a visible cost of her previous life's purpose. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of her motivation ("press her ear against destiny's door") which borders on diagnostic, though it is quickly grounded in concrete action.

    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and embodied contradictions acting simultaneously ("heart pounding" while "firmly adaptive").

    Unit 347's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in its existential questioning, compelling its higher-stakes choice to play the violin. Its "remarkably composed" nature is a consistent trait that becomes both a gift and a barrier, creating a credible internal conflict. The final choice to surrender to the music is earned by prior causality, foreclosing its old path with a visible, felt cost of its former composed state.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent desire for transparency, compelling her higher-stakes choice to renounce the lens's power. Her internal conflict—between the desire to bridge gaps and the need to respect privacy—is dramatized in her on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's characterization is deeply integrated with his role and setting, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.

    Eleanor's characterization is exceptional, with embodied emotion ("vibrations flowed through her body") and a clear motivation that intensifies through micro-choices like experimenting with different records.

    Kael's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in his acoustically perceptive nature and family tradition. His final choice to "unbind the silence" feels earned by prior causality.

Her internal conflict—"hope could be as dangerous as despair"—is dramatized in-scene, and her final micro-choice to pack away the eyes shows a credible endurance.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her skeptical yet sympathetic nature, compelling her higher-stakes choice to invite others. Her internal conflict is shown through her scientific mind wrestling with the unexplained warmth of the tile.

Micro-choices under pressure, like consulting the phrasebook and trusting the falcon, reveal his values.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)

Her internal conflict is shown through the blurring of boundaries between her emotions and borrowed memories, particularly in the ballroom and below deck. The final choice to become the chronicler is earned by the prior causality of her ability and the ship's nature. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstract summary in the final paragraph ("blissfully aberrant as that connection").

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Eleanor's characterization is exceptionally concrete and consistent, with her "warmly methodical" nature guiding every action. Her motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" is dramatized through her meticulous documentation and the high-stakes choice to reconfigure the rope. The final choice is earned by prior causality, and her professional detachment balances awe, creating a credible, flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied micro-choices like tracing ice patterns and maintaining focused intent during the bloom. However, the emotional range is somewhat narrow, lacking contradictory impulses in peak moments, and the final endurance feels slightly tidy without deeper internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her retrocognition is a well-integrated trait that constrains and enables her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elthion's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, nostalgic character trait that compels his actions. His internal conflict is embodied in lines like "preemptively nostalgic nature already cherishing the moment before it had passed," though this phrasing edges toward telling. His final choice to write is a credible endurance scaled to the story's length, earned by his established dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's professional competence and focused motivation are clear and consistent. His micro-choices, like tracing the mosaic and the methodical untying of the rag, reveal character under pressure. However, his internal emotional state remains somewhat observational; a more embodied contradiction in his peak moment would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maya's characterization is deeply embodied, with her hand moving instinctively to the jade cicada and her perception filtered through her expertise. Her internal conflict between funding anxiety and intellectual curiosity is shown simultaneously. The final choice to reframe her research is earned by her prior tangential approach and the cicada's symbolic weight. A minor deduction for Professor Aris, who applies pressure but remains a slightly functional secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's characterization is potent and specific, with her claustrophobia and obsessive motivation ("to collect the flavors of different silences") rendered through embodied, contradictory emotion. Her final choice to ascend is fully earned by seven years of preparation. The doll provides comfort but lacks the same depth of integration, feeling slightly more symbolic than crucible-like in their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and profound, rooted in a consistent, fluidly logical mind. His actions—adjusting prisms, reading the storm glass—are embodied and reveal character under pressure. The final satisfaction is earned by prior causality, though the trait "fluidly logical" is occasionally stated rather than fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a protector. Her "wisely adventurous" trait is demonstrated through her cautious yet decisive actions.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tender shadow keeper’s characterization is potent, with embodied contradictions (craving solitude yet bound by purpose) and micro-choices under pressure (tracing the ring, deciding to knock). Her final choice to help is earned by the resonant ache of her own scars, making the renunciation of isolation feel inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya's motivation is clear, rooted in her past trauma and desire for redemption, compelling her higher-stakes choice. Her scientific mind and mischievous nature are shown through her actions, not told. The final choice to use the bolt feels earned by her established character. A minor deduction for the "shadowseam wonder" descriptor, which feels slightly abstract and diagnostic for a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy. His "eloquently silent" demeanor is a consistent, defining trait shown through stillness and focus.

However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; his emotional state is more told than shown through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Galen's characterization is strong, with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in his withdrawn nature and search for forbidden knowledge. His internal conflict—withdrawal versus a calling for something more—is embodied and drives the narrative. The final change is earned through his study and practice, though the initial discovery of the program feels slightly convenient, a minor causality break that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eleanor's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent, contradictory impulses (solace in records vs. personal grief) and embodied emotion ("the ache of her grief never quite faded"). Her motivation to "magnify small kindnesses" is dramatized through micro-choices like studying dust patterns. Benjamin's on-page presence is brief but potent, establishing immediate kinship; his gentle hands and cracked voice reveal character under pressure. The final connection is earned, though his late arrival slightly limits the relationship's on-page crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes choices. Her "carefully resourceful" trait is embodied in micro-choices like using the puddle's reflection. However, her internal conflict and embodied emotion are more summarized than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ethan's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied memory. His micro-choice to play the saxophone is a credible, high-stakes action that earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits (orderliness, devotion). Her transformation is earned through on-page causality, with the moonstone discovery compelling a higher-stakes choice. The final choice to decode and warn feels motivated by her established role.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his high-stakes choice to descend. His internal conflict is shown in scene ("uncertainly certain"), and his final renunciation of precision is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his high-stakes choice to forge a new coin. His internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly in the moment he whispers "Lumina," anchoring his regret. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though a slight over-reliance on thematic language ("luminous regret") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is deeply rooted in personal tragedy, with his backstory about his sister providing a credible and poignant drive. His micro-choices, like using the bell to elicit laughter, reveal a hierarchy of values centered on healing. The child ghost Thomas is not a stereotype, with his fear of forgetting laughter adding emotional specificity. The final choice feels earned, though the secondary character's on-page presence is limited to the climax, slightly reducing relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kai's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his trauma responses and proprioceptive enhancements driving his actions and perceptions. His motivation to discover the "mathematics of mercy" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his final choice.

His micro-choices under pressure—collecting dust, examining the device—reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to engage with the spirits feels earned by his established acceptance and professional curiosity. A slight deduction for a minor over-reliance on his "skillfully observant" trait as a label, though it is largely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eldon's motivation ("desperate longing to hold onto a past") is clear, concrete, and drives the central action. His characterization is shown through specific, embodied actions ("fingers, stained with the ink of impossible realities, trembled"). The final choice to touch the words is a credible endurance that forecloses his old path, though the internal cost of this destruction is slightly more told than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("poetically inclined," "burnished sorrow of lost causes"), compelling his high-stakes choice to write a new narrative. His emotions are embodied ("traced his fingers," "burned brighter") and his final act of creation is a credible endurance. However, the internal contradiction between his revolutionary past and his new, creative method is more summarized than dramatized in simultaneous, contradictory impulses within a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is a fully realized character whose motivation ("to reclaim the light") is clear, deeply personal, and intensifies under pressure. His micro-choices—humming, focusing energy—reveal his values and competence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)

Her "perpetually learning" trait is dramatized through her active re-evaluation of the archway.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ellara's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in a professional obsession that becomes deeply personal. Her embodied emotions ("searing reverie of teargas in her throat") and micro-choices (arranging beach debris) reveal character under pressure. A minor deduction for a slight over-competence; her transition from archivist to active time-traveler feels almost too seamless, lacking a more pronounced moment of genuine struggle or a blind spot that compounds difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elior's motivation is clear and rooted in his rejection of false comfort; his epiphany feels earned through specific reflection and culminates in a decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deepens credibly from archivist to emotional archaeologist. His internal conflict is embodied in the tactile experience with the wax cylinder, and his final resolve feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Anya's motivation is clear, rooted in biological urgency and a shift from preservation to experience. Her "furious tranquility" is embodied throughout, with micro-choices under pressure (arranging seeds by dormancy) revealing her values.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a credulous curiosity that compels his high-stakes choice to bypass modern systems. His interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with embodied emotion shown through actions like testing the rope fibers.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elion's characterization is deeply integrated with his spiritual curiosity, which compels his higher-stakes choice to step into the void. His vulnerability is not a label but a dramatized trait that earns his transformation. The final renunciation of his station's instruments for an empathic leap is motivated by prior causality. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic language in the final paragraph's wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    The recluse's "tranquil perception" is embodied through specific micro-choices (silent sitting, gestural communication) that reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Their final renunciation—choosing to preserve rather than explain—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the final image of the dissolving bee. Contradictory impulses (gift/curse of perception) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and profound, driving her choices. Her internal conflict and emotional embodiment are strong, particularly in the suspended moment of discovery. The final choice to embed her own messages is an earned renunciation that forecloses isolation with a felt cost. A slight deduction for the "suddenly timeless" moment feeling slightly unmotivated by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion. However, the protagonist's primary on-page action is observation and writing; a micro-choice under pressure that alters tactics is subtle, leaning more on reflection than decisive action, which caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("his arthritis flared") and micro-choices that reveal values. However, his "brazen calm" is more told than shown in peak beats, and the final peace feels slightly earned through summary rather than a final, contradictory on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian's "academically rebellious" nature and "luminous skepticism" are not just labels but drivers of his choice to diverge from the footprints at the spiral galaxy sculpture, a micro-choice revealing his hierarchy of values. His final renunciation of the amber is earned by his prior internal conflict about the pilgrimage's artificiality, with the cost of letting go of his proof made legible. A minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated epiphany ("The chemistry of homecoming isn't about returning... but about recognition.") which edges into diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique traits (speaking dead languages, understanding bird calls). His actions are consistent, and his final choice to scatter the seeds is a credible renunciation with a felt cost—his exhaustion and the depletion of his precious pods.

    Elara's characterization is strong, with a clear, consistent motivation that evolves from survival to a higher purpose.

The final choice—endurance and acceptance of her duty—is earned by the story's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, shifting from proving worth to embracing the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's characterization is deeply specific and compelling. Her contradictions—benevolence and ruthlessness—are dramatized through her mission to preserve memories, culminating in a micro-choice to touch the pawn, a gesture of witness. Her embodied emotion ("the nomadic penumbra clung to her silhouette") and clear motivation rooted in personal loss create a credible, flawed individual. The final endurance is earned, though a slight diagnostic tinge ("knowing her mission was far from over") prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maven's motivation is clear and profound, rooted in a specific, embodied search for home. Her internal conflict is shown through concrete actions (sitting motionless, using the glass as a shield) and her emotional progression from feeling lost to carrying home within her is earned. The final renunciation of a physical home for a conceptual one is a credible endurance with a felt cost. A slight deduction for the "buried talents" revelation feeling somewhat declarative rather than fully dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Marcel's uncertainty and reverence are embodied through concrete micro-choices like tracing stone scars. His final realization that uncertainty was preparation for clarity shows earned endurance with visible cost when the workshop tilts. Contradictory impulses of doubt and purpose act simultaneously.

His motivation—the hidden promise to preserve beauty—is dramatized through the discovery of the seashell, compelling a higher-stakes choice. The final endurance feels earned by prior causality, though the transition from despair to renewed purpose could be slightly more textured.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, gentle nature. His final choice to use the cork is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The navigator’s patchwork body and scars provide concrete, embodied interiority, and the final choice to build the bridge is a credible micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her condition, with micro-choices like the careful recitation of names revealing her methodical nature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a vividly rendered character whose eccentricity and isolation are concrete. His motivation to investigate is clear, and his final gesture is a credible, earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a deeply realized character whose loneliness and empirical intuition are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, such as tracing the chip's edges and trusting the ants.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's disenchantment is embodied and her motivation clear, rooted in dreams and a desire for meaning beyond her role. Her internal conflict is shown through her simultaneous draw and terror at the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and a credible, earned final choice. Leo's characterization is thinner but sufficient for his role; the relationship as a crucible is effective. The final renunciation of her old artistic purpose is motivated by the secret's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is profound and contradictory, with his jealousy of past selves and obsession with chronicling creating palpable internal conflict.

The final choice to continue chronicling feels inevitable given prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is deeply embodied, with her loss of smell grounding her motivation and her micro-choices (tracing the screw's edges) revealing her values.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptionally embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (revisiting superstitions to halt crystallization) revealing a clear hierarchy of values.

The crystallization flaw complicates choices credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eloise's motivation is clear, rooted in regret, and her micro-choices (adjusting the perfume bottle, setting up the equipment) reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The witness's motivation is clear and intensifies, but their translucent, cosmic nature limits embodied, contradictory interiority. The final choice feels earned, yet the character remains more conceptual than visceral, lacking the micro-choices and emotional granularity for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlo's motivation is clear, rooted in a lifelong struggle to understand time's nature. His final renunciation (vowing never to use the key conventionally) is earned by the on-page experiment, a micro-choice with visible cost.

A hairline deduction for a slight over-reliance on told motivation ("his motivation, stemming from years...") which is later shown perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her spatial gift, compelling her to higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict between professional duty and deeper curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices with the laser.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)

Her motivation to "widen perspectives responsibly" is dramatized through her subway research and final reinterpretation of the scrawls, culminating in a micro-choice to see them as "invitations" rather than codes.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is rendered with profound specificity through embodied emotion ("weathered fingers," "melodically haunted") and a clear, escalating motivation rooted in loss.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)

    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, poignant worldview ("joyful sorrow"). His interiority is concrete and character-particular, evidenced by his embodied connection to his mother's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maya's characterization is exceptionally nuanced, with her arsonist past and analytical intuition driving every choice. Her internal conflict is embodied in concrete actions like trembling hands and the micro-choice to sketch replicas. The final realization—using destruction to preserve—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the restored portrait revealing her own face. A hairline deduction for the slightly abstract phrase "volcanic tenderness" in peak moments, but it remains character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena's quiet rebellion through drumming is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (tapping diagnostic panels) revealing her values.

The neural entanglement premise grounds her actions in consistent, character-bound knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlo's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His motivation to prove his method is clear and escalates, driving the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian's purpose is clear and embodied, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped.

Her internal conflict ("combative tenderness of yearning") acts simultaneously in scene, and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost as barriers dissolve and she dives.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The performer's motivation is clear, rooted in journal-revealed intent to "cultivate lightness in grief."

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena's characterization is deeply integrated with her role and abilities. Her "calmly intuitive" nature is not a label but a demonstrated trait that drives the climax, and her motivation to "map empathy onto action" is the story's ethical core.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her handling of the parasol tip. Her motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is dramatized through her actions and reflections, compelling her higher-stakes choice to stay. However, the "euthanasia tourist" premise, while a clear motive, functions more as backstory than a present, choice-driving pressure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The therapist's serene, "decisively kind" presence is a consistent and credible anchor, and her internal reflection on her role is character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her determination. Her final transformation feels earned by prior causality, though a slight diagnostic label ("understanding dawning") appears at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist's patience and reverence are consistently embodied through deliberate physical actions ("holding each position for long minutes") and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cyrus is a well-realized POV with clear, specific motivation rooted in regret and eroded ambitions. His chronological confusion is a compelling flaw that informs his actions, and his final negotiation is an earned, decisive change.

Her motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is dramatized through her technical work and the discovery of the sextant's inscriptions, culminating in an earned stance crystallization. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the final paragraph ("chart a course toward the future") which feels slightly more declarative than her established internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's characterization is concrete and his motivation is clear, rooted in specific memories and embodied emotion. The bear functions as a secondary pressure source, its intelligent presence feeling organic to his internal conflict.

A minor deduction for the couple, who function more as plot catalysts than fully pressurized characters.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aria's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her specific sensitivity. Her micro-choices (placing objects, stepping back to observe) reveal her values under pressure. The final understanding feels earned by her methodical actions, though the epiphany itself is slightly declarative.

    The diver's internal conflict is embodied and credible, with a clear emotional progression from certainty to nuanced understanding.

    Esme's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her defiance of fate. Her "neatly inventive" trait is demonstrated through on-page action and problem-solving.

    Clear motivation (recovering purpose by crafting “safe zones for inquiry”) and a coherent inner texture rooted in ritualized narration and craft. The bookmark and the abandoned setting externalize his grief without melodrama. Internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressured; the struggle feels steady, not contested, leaving limited visible cost in the moment. Still, his micro-choices at the bench credibly reveal values and a modest before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, pressure‑driven interiority (claustrophobia vs. the need to move) with concrete micro‑choices (breathing techniques, decrypting under the clock). Motivation is coherent and escalates into a stance shift (relinquishing control for vulnerability). Some therapy‑speak/generalized affirmations (“Vulnerability is power,” “authentic Maya”) blunt specificity at peak beats. Still, actions align with traits and the cost of the final stance reads.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and coherent—she intends to draw a map through the night—and the shift from “mildly obsessed” to “violently determined” lands. Interiority is particular (pebbles, gold leaf, bodily handling), though internal contradiction is mild and seldom presses her into visible risk beyond renunciation. Her agency (choosing to guide rather than prevent) is credible and earned by the accumulative pressure. The emotional cost is present but conceptually framed rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear, character‑specific interiority (protocol vs curiosity) drives on‑page choices, and the trait of stability both enables and impedes understanding. The micro‑choices—touch, lift, play, surrender—track motivation credibly. Emotional texture occasionally tips into summary abstraction, but the internal conflict is present in scene. The closing renunciation of external directives feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s ethical drive is clear and consistent, and her renunciation of the lens reads as a character choice. However, interior conflict is largely narrated rather than embodied; her temptation and struggle feel tidy and low-friction. The line “test of her own integrity” states the arc instead of dramatizing it. More sensory embodiment under pressure would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—to prove the garden knows its gardener—is clear and consistent, embodied through the ritual of polishing and placing marbles. Interiority is specific to his craft and age, with the “withered” body mirroring seasonal cycles. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are limited; he faces little direct challenge beyond the anticipated scientists. The endurance choice at the end reads earned but carries a muted on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aris’s motive is clear and consistent, and her procedural choices (the lever sequence) align with it. However, interiority skews declarative and tidy, with little friction or contradictory impulse under pressure. The “icy warmth” label recurs but doesn’t evolve into embodied conflict. Competence is high and untested, so the final sense of purpose reads earned conceptually but not emotionally taxed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive (artistic pull/kinship with the ghost) is clear and drives tactile choices (lifting the program, deciding to play). Interiority is specific to a musician’s sensibility, though internal contradiction is minimal and risk tolerance feels assumed rather than tested. The final renunciation—the program dissolving as price—lands, but his emotional struggle under pressure stays relatively smooth. Strong, but not fully crucible‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives are clear and character‑specific: a fault‑tolerant oracle driven to recover the “swallowed truth.” Embodied details (shaking hands, snow on the floor, post‑fever clarity) ground his interiority. The piece lacks a sharp contradictory impulse on the page; he moves with near‑singular purpose. Still, his micro‑choices (smudging archival art; packing to leave while weak) reveal values with some cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motives (reckless curiosity, skepticism, need to surface a “swallowed truth”) are clear and embodied through tactile engagement with the valve wheel and the radio. The internal contradiction—religiously skeptical yet using talk-radio psychics—adds texture. The closing shift toward accepting unspoken truths reads earned but low-cost. Emotional specificity is solid, if occasionally phrased in familiar terms.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—an observer compelled to chronicle—and the temptation of the regenerative silence gives a credible internal counterforce. The key micro‑choices (deploying the swan, entering, resisting stasis, returning) align with that motive. However, the embodied emotional cost is more stated than felt; the “anchor” line is strong but the struggle isn’t dramatized beyond it. Depth of contradiction is present but remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motives and interior texture are clear and embodied: her locket, adaptive practice, and eclipse plan align with her grief history and purpose. Her micro‑choices—inviting Lila to drum, modulating tempo, framing the eclipse as music—feel character‑specific. A touch of aphoristic phrasing (“resilience wasn’t about strength but flexibility”) slightly smooths complexity. Lila is sketched minimally but credibly, with her silence and tentative drumming read through Maya’s lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—preserving what the walls have heard—but internal contradiction is minimal and largely told. Agency is mostly attentive curation rather than pressured choice, with few micro-decisions beyond extracting diaries and tracing threads. Emotional texture leans abstract (“bronze quiet”) rather than embodied in the body. Still, the historian’s sensibility filters the world convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority leans abstract and generalized (“open secrets,” “transpose life into a new key”) rather than character‑particular. We get few embodied emotions or contradictory impulses under pressure. His micro‑choices (typing, sealing, sending) are procedural, not tested. The ending smile signals stance, but without visible cost or a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Father Michael’s motive is clear and specific—save Sarah using heretical methods he has pioneered—and his tactics adapt under pressure (loops, paradox, imposed silence). Interiority is present (trembling, faint smile, recognition of the entity’s pride) but lacks a true contradictory impulse or felt moral cost on the page. Sarah functions as a vessel rather than a pressure‑applying character. The ending shows competence more than sacrifice, keeping the arc strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he’s “chronologically homesick” and determined to conduct an unheard symphony from childhood memories. Interiority is embodied through concrete sensory recalls (honey, tin roof, old books). Contradictory impulses are modest (yearning vs. creeping exhaustion) but present enough to create pressure. The key micro-choice (pressing the nautilus to his forehead) aligns action with motive and helps earn the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—he seeks to “conquer the labyrinth of self,” with hope and dread coexisting on the viaduct. Actions (placing the tablet, initiating the procedure, moving deeper) align with and escalate his drive. Interiority is embodied (hovering, tactile warmth, the paradoxical dark/bright), though the final realization lands a touch tidy. The acceptance feels earned but carries limited visible cost beyond relinquishing the need to be “fixed.”

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is explicit and steady—she seeks to defeat numbness—and her actions align (picking up the broken needle, experimenting, teaching). Interiority is embodied through tactile perception (“vibrations flowed through her body”) rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; success comes relatively smoothly with little on‑page resistance. The final renunciation of despair reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (integrity vs. fear) and embodied choices (lateral movement, trembling fingers) read specific and credible. Internal conflict is present but tidy, with the “nurture integrity in solitude” refrain edging toward abstraction. Competence and caution blend well with risk, though the cost of the final act remains mostly implied. The occupational lens (storm recorder) genuinely informs perception and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motive is clear and pressured: a cautious man confronting scent-triggered grief to seek understanding. His micro-choices (angling the UV lantern, staying with the unfolding notes, placing the vial in a case) align with his contradictions. Embodied emotion lands via specific scent-memories rather than labels. The final stance—a costly acceptance—feels earned, though a few lines verge on overt thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear, particular motivation (“discover the texture of time”) and a consistent sensibility anchor the poet. Internal tension between resistance and acceptance is present but mostly stated rather than dramatized under pressure. Agency is gentle—arranging the rope and observing—so contradiction doesn’t bite. The final repricing of stance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motive—to translate a ruined world’s vibrations into beauty—is clear and consistent, and his choice to “unbind the silence” through playing is credible. Interiority is largely summarized rather than dramatized under pressure, giving us fewer contradictory impulses in the moment. The mendicant’s bowl and listening practice reveal character through action. The change (accepting purpose as an echo-harbor violinist) is earned but lightly contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear professional drive and a consistent ethic of “half truths” define Elias, and his micro‑choices (choosing the amber grotto, selecting bittersweet nostalgia, subsuming the last remnants) align with that. The contradiction—compassion versus detachment—is present but never tested under pressure. Emotions are mostly told rather than embodied under strain, limiting depth in the peak beat. Still, he reads as particular and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s motives (recognition and uplift) are clear and consistent, and his actions align (returning the envelope, offering help, securing sponsors). However, there’s little on‑page internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure; he meets minimal resistance. Eleanor has texture but exerts limited counter‑pressure. The final renunciation/cost is faint, so the arc reads more admirable than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s longing to belong is clear, embodied in tactile craft and the risky search she initiates. Her agency (proposing the quest, engineering pulleys, carving the sigil) aligns with motive. Internal contradiction is mild; she moves fairly smoothly from isolation to connection without a sharp in‑scene self‑conflict. Still, the closing dedication reads earned by prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, urgent motivation and a consistent internal logic drive his choices, and the on‑page cost (shortened future) lands. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or reveals layered impulses under pressure. Embodied details (gloved fingers on the pendant, breath syncing with the pulse) help, but much of the feeling is declared rather than conflicted. A touch of heroic flatness keeps it below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive (quantifying emotion to reach her vanished mentor) is clear and sustained, with a credible tension between disciplined caution and “buried optimism.” Her embodied actions—tracing chips, invoking equations, handling the glass eyes—align with motive. Internal contradiction is present but gentle; the piece avoids a sharp on‑page price beyond self‑guarded hope. The final renewed‑purpose choice reads earned, if low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—an ex‑preservationist turned secret custodian aiming to be “visible” to those in need. Interiority is specific (catalog numbers, tactile engagement with pipes and tape), though internal contradiction is muted and risk‑averse. The key choice—help indirectly without revealing the self—reads as an earned endurance/renunciation, but the felt cost stays mostly conceptual. A sharper moment of jeopardy or self‑conflict under pressure would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s control‑driven identity and sincere, data‑bound obsession are clear, and her shift to release is credibly motivated by observed outcomes and loss. Interiority is concrete (compass, ruler, pinned leaf) and her final choice bears cost and aligns with her arc. Some beats lean toward summary over embodied contradiction, softening micro‑choices under pressure. Marco’s presence hints at relational pressure but remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motives are clear (finding purpose/relief from insomnia) and dramatized through the hesitation over the brooch exchange. Embodied detail—trembling hands, the brooch’s warmth imprint—grounds emotion. The internal conflict is modest but credible, with attachment vs. responsibility resolved at cost. Secondary character pressure is apt and humane, sharpening the choice without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is coherent and specific to a seasoned seer confronted by novelty, and her micro-choices (studying the pearl, touching the crystal, reframing her role) track. However, conflict is largely internal and friction-light; acceptance comes with minimal hesitation or embodied struggle. The cost—relinquishing predictive certainty—is more conceptual than felt. Moments like “Everyday magic,” read as neat rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elina’s role and aim (“compile fragments into meaning”) are clear, and her choice to share the herald’s true story is consistent and compassionate. However, her interior life is summarized rather than dramatized; we rarely feel embodied conflict or contradictory impulses as she works. She functions more as an interpreting conduit than a pressured person. The emotional progression from discovery to disclosure is convincing but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear traits (meticulous, analytically artistic) and a credible motive (seek the fortress) guide his choices. A live tension—his love of geometry versus a realm that defies it—appears in lines like “Each step forward was a dare against his analytical nature.” Interiority is present but leans declarative at times, softening felt contradiction. The final commitment to return reads earned, with a modest cost in altered self and tool integration.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive (skeptical, courageously kind, seeking connection) is clear and consistent, and her choice to invite others is plausibly earned. However, interior contradiction is light and often told rather than dramatized; we seldom feel opposing impulses in-scene. Emotional embodiment skews abstract (“unheard symphony,” “spaces in between”) over concrete sensation. The shift to keeper/advocate lands but without a visible personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (boredom, Elara, balance) and actions align, but internal conflict is thin and swiftly resolved. Interiority leans toward summary and certainty rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The decisive shift to “guardian with a mission” feels earned but low-cost. More embodied struggle would heighten credibility of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motives and contradictions (honesty vs inherited deception) are clear and embodied in choice under pressure. Her competence is credible, with small tremors (“fingers trembled”) that humanize her. The moral calculus is present but occasionally over-tidy (“laws must be bent to serve justice”) reducing messy ambiguity. Still, micro‑choices track well from observation to breach to stamping the seal.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied in ritualized micro‑choices (waiting, listening, annotating), with the isolation cost sketched but not deeply dramatized. Interiority is particular to his craft, though internal contradiction is minimal. The “earnest studiousness” registers as constraint and strength. A quiet endurance is earned, but pressure on his values remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive—rebuilding a self from overheard stories—feels coherent and lived-in. Micro-choices (pilgrimaging at low tide, pocketing and keeping the label, sheltering in containers) align with that drive. However, internal contradiction is stated more than dramatized; tension between reclaiming a past self and renouncing it rarely bites on the page. The final renunciation (“Who was I before… doesn’t matter”) lands but without a visible moment of pressure forcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Evelyn’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with objects (door, seashell, cello) reveals character. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates or pays a visible price beyond a conceptual shift. The “myth buster” identity reorients toward ambiguity at the end, but the cost remains largely thematic rather than dramatized. A few more pressured micro‑choices would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motives (bridge tradition and survival) are clear and drive concrete actions (decoding, mapping, instructing, planting coded counterproposals). The internal contradiction (dual allegiance) is present and resolves credibly in the end with the returned stone and anonymity. Some beats compress struggle into summary (“For three nights, Maya barely slept”) rather than dramatizing stress under pressure. Emotional embodiment is solid but could show more moment-to-moment cost during the council pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motive is clear and steady, and her competence is believably embodied through gear handling and vigilance. The endurance choice (to stay, time, and shoot under pressure) is earned, with a felt emotional cost at the finale. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she manages sadness rather than wrestling with any destabilizing impulse—so the crucible feels contained. A touch of on‑the‑page lapse or doubt could deepen character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive (repair as guidance/connection) is clear and consistent, and his tactile micro‑choices at the bench read credible. Internal contradiction is light; he faces pressure but little real doubt or error. The competence tilt limits felt cost, though the “steadier hands than yesterday” note gestures toward vulnerability. The teacher–apprentice bond is off‑page, so the relational crucible remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elmsley’s motive (to locate the rivers’ origin) is consistent and drives choices (leaving the outpost, following the falcon, gathering evidence). Interiority is particular enough—his editor’s eye and phrasebook habit color perception—though internal contradiction is light. The “intention” belief risks tidy certainty, but the closing acceptance of proof‑gathering tempers it. Emotional embodiment is present (condensation, auroras) but the cost to him remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas’s motive is clean and consistent, and his methodical micro‑choices (placing feet, striking the fork) align with his craft. However, interior conflict is minimal; he encounters little psychological resistance beyond stamina. The “infinitely patient” trait is shown but not tested against a contrary impulse. The change at the end reads as earned endurance rather than a risked choice with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (solve the temple before oxygen runs out) and a credible internal conflict (training vs compulsion) drive specific micro‑choices like inserting the vial. Embodied stress reads in tremors, alarms, and lung burn. A touch of lofty diction blunts the particularity of her interiority at peaks, but her final choice feels earned. The rescue’s neatness softens visible personal cost but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear motive (escape the father’s legacy; be believed) and consistent interior texture, with tactile rituals (pressing face to the lattice, writing on walls). Internal contradiction is present but softly drawn—he “has lies yet to tell” while pledging truth, without a hard test on the page. Micro-choices exist (practice his truth; decide to act before bodies are found) but lack adversarial pressure. The final stance shift feels earned by accumulation rather than a decisive, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ghost bride’s motive is clear and consistent—repay a debt and move on—and her key micro‑choice (retrieving the vial and releasing the seeds) aligns with it. Interiority is present but mostly externalized through image rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The relationship with Thomas is moving yet largely summarized. The felt cost at the end (her dissipation) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to transform ruin into reverence via art—is clear and consistent, and her exhaustion supplies a modest cost. However, internal contradiction is thin; the sleepwalking reduces on‑page micro‑choices under pressure, softening agency. Embodied emotion appears in tactile details (thread/needle), but the piece leans on summary over in‑scene struggle. Still, her belief and actions cohere and culminate in an earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive (reconnecting with heritage/restoring faith) is clear and escalates through concrete acts (volunteering, offerings, assembly). Interiority is specific enough to feel lived, with tactile engagement (tracing carvings, speaking the old tongue). However, contradictions and costs are softened; his near-preternatural intuition reduces friction and the relationship with Elena doesn’t meaningfully pressure him. The final change is earned but achieved without a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her tactile relationship with the clipboard, chalk rituals, and reframing of her vocation all feel lived-in. Motivation is consistent (crafting reinvention in a surveilled world), and the final mailing reflects a credible, earned stance shift. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are muted; the deadline registers more as mood than stress-test. The cost of her realization is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive—to listen with her hands and preempt a coup—reads clear and consistent, and her tactics (feigned foolishness, coded embroidery) align with that drive. However, she faces little on‑page friction or contradiction; competence remains untested, and emotional cost is mostly implied. The visiting official scene gives some status play and subtext, but it doesn’t force a painful trade‑off. The ending secures endurance rather than a visible renunciation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent—summoning the “moment before deciding” and the apology—but her interior contradiction (hunger for explanation vs. readiness to forgive) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in decisions. The embodied details (forehead to glass, shard warming) help. The turn from “not enough” after “I’m sorry” to compassion at “I was afraid” reads earned but gentle. A touch of repeated abstraction (“fierce tenderness”) flattens specificity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motive—to help Lina metabolize grief through “translation”—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (reading the cast, whispering, returning the coral) align. Interiority is specific (conflict‑zone translator lens) and embodied through how he handles the coral and cast. The internal contradiction is gentler than ideal (competence vs. ache), leaving limited friction. Still, the final renunciatory poise reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    Amelia’s motive (to recover lost joy) is clear and her actions align, but on‑page contradictory impulses are minimal, so pressure never tests her in a revealing way. The closest friction—the council’s doubt—is summarized and easily overcome. Interiority is serviceable yet leans declarative (“she knew better”), blunting embodied conflict. The ending change (joy rekindled) is earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s vocation and “methodically playful” temperament are clear, and her choices (accepting the nickel’s call, painting eyes closed, returning the coin) track. The interior change from certainty to curiosity is legible, though largely unopposed—she encounters little resistance or contradictory impulse. Emotions are embodied through tactile and acoustic perceptions rather than abstract labels. The cost is present but soft: she relinquishes professional certainty without a painful on‑page trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and specific, but interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. The coded tomato/aphid exchange hints at a lived method, yet we rarely see micro-choices or contradictory impulses enacted in-scene. The final “untaxed thought” moment reads emotionally true but isn’t earned through on‑page struggle. Overall, strong concept of character with limited embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The insomniac poet’s drive is clear and consistent—transform pain so others can rest—and their choices (singing, persisting, surrendering life) align. Interiority is lyric rather than granular, so contradictions are felt more in texture than specific moments. Still, the endurance reads as an Earned Stasis with visible cost (a life of sleeplessness). The persona stays archetypal, limiting psychological specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleth’s motive—to preserve forgotten names—is clear and drives concrete choices (selecting a cylinder, focusing light, rehanging the tube). Interiority is textured (tears “like tiny glass orchids,” “foxglove regret”) but internal conflict is muted; they face little resistance beyond melancholy and care. The ending registers an earned endurance rather than a change, with a soft cost (accepting slow loss). Strong presence, slightly under-pressured struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s motive and temperament (“carefully reckless,” “cautious exuberance”) are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices—pushing bold interpretations, deciding to present—fit her. Internal tension between risk and scholarly integrity is present but mostly told rather than dramatized under pressure. We don’t see her make a costly relational choice on the page; the pressure remains anticipatory. Still, her interiority feels specific to a linguist’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive—harmonizing preservation and utility—is clear and consistent, and her occupational competence feels lived-in. Interiority is present (trembling, excitement) but largely unconflicted; she rarely faces a value trade that costs her. The “slyly heartfelt” tactic hints at complexity, though its price isn’t dramatized. The final stance shift (from anxious to assured) is credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to reclaim a lost vocation and preserve “the echo of lost songs”—is specific and sustained, with embodied habits (dust‑mapping, meteorite as paperweight) revealing her mind under pressure. The internal contradiction (reinvention vs. return) is credible and carried in tactile choices. The final renunciation of her “fictional Elara the bookseller” for “Elara of the Flight Paths” lands as an earned shift, though the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. A touch more friction or visible risk in the release beat would deepen felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—decoding thresholds and finding “home”—is clear and sustained, with tangible micro-choices (reading grain, trusting intuition, touching the oak). Interiority is specific to her upbringing (maze architect’s child) and method. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the epiphany comes smoothly, with little on‑page friction. The reunion read as earned but emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maya’s yearning for “belonging” is clear and consistent, and her curiosity drives tactile choices (following the feather, removing gloves, touching the glass). However, interior conflict is minimal and tidy; she rarely faces contradictory impulses or costs on the page. The “softly ingenious” trait reads more as label than pressure-tested flaw/asset. The final understanding feels earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear—she must understand vanished paths “before memory fades”—and her choice to plant a seed shows agency. However, internal conflict is minimal and quickly soothed by an immediate, low-friction insight. The “heaviest burden” of her gift is stated rather than dramatized under pressure. The epiphany lands without visible cost beyond a conceptual reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and we see specific micro-choices (targeting the woman, planting the bishop, cueing the quartet). Interiority fits his analytic bent, with the bishop’s diagonal metaphor adding character-specific texture. However, conflict is low and his competence faces little friction, so contradictory impulses never really act on the page. The emotional cost is largely confined to surrendering the mentor’s bishop, which lands but feels relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—preserving memory through transformation—and actions align (accepting anchoring, inscribing the body). Interiority is evocative but rarely conflicted; she meets the anchoring with little resistance, softening dramatic tension. Embodied emotion appears in the tactile stillness and “roots of energy,” but contradictory impulses are muted. The earned cost (mobility sacrificed) registers, though the struggle to pay it feels too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s vocation and perceptual habits are specific and credible, and her micro‑choices (leaving the workshop, casting the stone, resolving to reframe her craft) align with her sensibility. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the epiphany risks tidiness (“value in the mundane,” “truly seeing”), muting felt cost. Emotions are mostly conveyed via lyrical abstraction rather than embodied tension. Strong character texture, light conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and character‑specific: a firefighter driven to “translate pain into a universal language” through the cracked box. Embodied details (ache in bones, calloused fingers, cool porcelain) ground interiority. The internal contradiction—“hard softness,” courage vs. guilt—operates in scene. The closing renunciation (from accusation to companion) is earned with a felt cost: accepting marked survival.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s drive (“новой науки—a science of hopeful trajectories”) and internal contradiction (logical mind vs. dreaming heart) are clear and enacted through specific choices (weight adjustments, patterning). Interiority feels character‑particular, with embodied moments (trembling fingers, kneeling in gratitude). The cost at closure is subdued, leaning more toward resolve than sacrifice. Still, actions align with motives and reveal him under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s vocation and desire are clear, and her choices (enter side passage, preserve diaries, develop film, accept legacy) align with motive. However, interior conflict is minimal and largely summary-driven; there’s little contradictory impulse or embodied cost under pressure. The “legacy’s burden” acceptance feels more declared than dramatized, dulling the felt change. A stronger moment of risk or renunciation would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (to coax mirrors to reveal possibilities) and her ritualized choices under time pressure feel consistent with her calm, disciplined nature. Interiority is present but largely textural; the glimpse of alternate selves hints at conflict without a hard, contested choice. The cost—melancholy separation from the terrace’s heartbeat—lands, though the struggle toward it is gentle rather than fraught. Earned Stasis reads credible for this length, if emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s motives (ending a forever war, seeking redemption) are clear and consistent, with embodied tells (worn shoes, trembling hands). We glimpse contradictory impulses—idealism vs. caution; gentleness vs. the need to “muster strength.” However, key pressures are summarized rather than dramatized, limiting micro-choices under fire. The final gesture (leaving the clipboard) reads as an earned endurance/renunciation but lacks an on-page pitched confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s contradiction—amoral magnate vs. covert preservationist—is concretely dramatized (boots crunching, salt biting, the prized egg relinquished). Motivation is clear and consistent, intensified by his months of secret study and the choice to place the egg. Interiority avoids therapy‑speak and shows shame and yearning braided together. Slight reliance on telling backstory keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motive and will are clear and consistent, but she reads more as an emblem than a fully individuated psyche. Interiority leans abstract (“purity of her presence,” “preserved her essence”) over embodied contradiction under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (kneeling, thread‑work, refusal of physical commerce) but the cost to her identity or attachments remains largely conceptual. The final shift convinces, though it’s earned more by ritual logic than character‑specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s ethic-driven serenity reads specific and consistent; his choices (centering homelessness, using the stick as narrator) align with motive. Internal tension with the mentor remains off‑stage, blunting on‑page crucible. Embodied emotion is muted but present in tactile prep and performance beats. The final recommitment feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—is clear and embodied through concrete ritual (knotting moon‑flower silk, affixing the moth wing). Interiority is specific (grandmother’s stories, the “interrupted cadence”) and felt rather than labeled. The internal conflict is subdued but present: grief and futility versus purposeful action. The ending’s earned stasis—choosing transient signals that will dissolve—carries a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and competence are clear and rooted in her craft; embodied details (fingers trembling, cheeks bitten by cold) ground motivation. The guilt→forgiveness pivot motivates the pilgrimage, and the final vow to stay registers as an earned renunciation. Internal contradiction is light—she rarely wavers, so pressure reveals little new about her complexity. The piece would benefit from one moment of genuine doubt or risk to test “technically gentle” against potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive to bridge her foresight/hindsight limitation is clear and consistent, and her ritualistic actions align with that motive. Interiority is specific at times (“precisely playful” hands on the seal), but conflict remains largely abstract with limited on‑page contradictory impulses. The change—achieving presence—is earned by prior setup but lands without an explicit felt price in the scene. Overall credible and coherent, if a touch tidy emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, coherent interior drive—frugality, devotion, and scientific rigor—culminates in the choice to place his hands on the tile. The science–mystic contradiction operates simultaneously rather than in alternation. Embodied beats (cool tile, flickering candle, "cooled honey") ground emotion, though some phrasing leans generic and reiterated (“empirically ironic”). The cost to Anu remains mostly implied (new regime risk) rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus’s motive (resentment as armor) is clear and his turn is anchored to a concrete ritual, but the epiphany arrives quickly, skirting struggle. Elara’s “scheming pacifist” angle is enacted via gentle manipulation, yet her interiority remains thin. Dialogue occasionally dips into therapy‑speak (“cellular memory,” “melody of your soul”), softening felt cost. The reconciliation beat reads earned in symbol, slightly light in embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    Motivation is consistent (erase boundaries, recreate rather than merely repair), and his choice not to capture the dream provides a modest turn. However, internal contradiction and struggle are muted; competence and serenity dominate, leaving little visible cost. Embodied details (grounded feet, tremor) help, but the arc feels more affirmation than tested change.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (repairing a broken bond) is clear, embodied (“quartz eye ache,” sore fingers), and tied to concrete micro‑choices (opening the bag, building the bridge, planting the seed). Her feistiness appears in action (“challenged even empty spaces”) and persistence. Internal contradiction (guilt vs. hope) is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in live friction. The final choice—planting the seed—feels earned with a felt cost (labor, vulnerability), if somewhat gently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Motivation is clear (lifelong pursuit of forbidden knowledge), and his choice to risk everything tracks, but contradictory impulses are light; fear or hesitation never truly complicate his resolve. Interiority is textured (“weight of collapsing stars”), with a few embodied beats (forehead to cool wall). Micro‑choices exist (securing the object, retreating to the bathroom, focusing attention) but feel low‑resistance. The arc lands, yet the cost to self remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—rescue driven by linguistic obsession—and her tactics (negotiation, dialect use) align with character. Interiority is present but mostly composed and competent, with limited contradictory impulses beyond a racing heart. Her success feels relatively smooth, with few mistakes or blind spots under pressure. The relationship dynamic with the guardians has legible status play but lacks sustained friction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—seeking the “garden of forgotten names” to reclaim self and give voice to others—and her actions (pressing the card, descending, touching the tree) align. The internal tension between “trapped freedom” and yearning for identity is legible when the boundaries blur aboard the ship. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, felt most in accepting a life of mediated memories. Some realizations (“She now understood her true purpose”) tilt toward declared insight rather than fully earned on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is crisp and consistent—Eleanor’s “warmly methodical” drive to document before acting informs her choices. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she faces little true hesitation or fear despite the fables’ warnings. Competence dominates without a visible flaw complicating the decision. The end choice feels earned but low-cost and emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and steady—preserve the ripple marks and “find the quiet in the storm”—but internal contradiction is minimal and stress degradation is never felt. The mapkeeper executes with near‑perfect competence (Ice Sanctum pattern → bloom of hush) with little visible emotional cost. The clearest micro‑choice is holding the hush with focused intent, yet it reads serene rather than pressured. Strong role specificity (mapkeeper craft) carries characterization despite low conflict within.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s goal and temperament are clear, and her endurance under solitude reads as a credible burden turned purpose. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from conviction to confirmation without significant doubt or error on the page. Micro‑choices (aligning to the North Star “as it had been two centuries ago”) are motivated but lightly contested. The felt cost is mostly inferred (loneliness, fragility of the rekindled light) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elthion’s motive is clear and particular—an archivist compelled to preserve collective memory—and his actions align (descending, listening, preparing the quill, choosing to remain). Internal contradiction is light; “preemptively nostalgic” signals a trait but seldom creates on‑page friction or a trade‑off beyond wistful ache. Emotions are largely conveyed via lyrical statement rather than embodied struggle, yet the vow to stay below frames a small, credible cost. The interior voice is coherent and character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he travels to rekindle hope—and professional habits (ambient awareness, ritual chanting) read character‑specific. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he meets no interpersonal or moral friction that tests competing values. Embodied moments like the “calloused fingers” and the rag’s weight help, but he remains largely unopposed and sure. The closing shift feels earned but costs him little beyond risk and spent materials.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular, with the jade cicada and tidal-pool lens revealing her character under pressure. The internal turn from avoidance to reframed resolve is credible, though a bit tidy and low-cost. Contradictory impulses (unease about funding vs. comfort in observational pause) appear but could be sharpened through a costlier on‑page trade. Aris applies light pressure but remains mostly a listener rather than an active crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—collecting flavors of silence to confront inherited claustrophobia—is clear, particular, and embodied in choices (training, ascent, collection, reluctant descent). Contradictory impulses (yearning for ascent vs. fear of confinement/safety) operate simultaneously on the page. Her relationship to the father is mostly off‑stage, but still pressures the arc via the bunker world’s daily cost. The closing renunciation (leaving the gilded hush) reads earned and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motive and competence are clear and specific, and his choices (angling prisms, timing the hush) align with those motives. However, he faces little internal contradiction or pressure; there’s no meaningful struggle beyond execution. Emotional embodiment is largely projected onto passengers rather than felt within Elias. The result is steady, admirable, but not deeply conflicted characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect, locate, and prepare the throne before sunrise—but internal contradiction is light. “Wisely adventurous” is dramatized in cautious yet bold moves (forbidden territories, methodical peeling). Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied under peak pressure. The renunciation at the end reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and character‑specific: the keeper’s cultivated isolation is challenged by the ring’s call and duty to “teach suffocating how to breathe.” Contradictory impulses (solace of emptiness vs obligation through scars) operate simultaneously and resolve in a costly choice. Micro‑choices are legible—touching the carvings, choosing the northern wall, three knocks, stepping through. A slight abstraction in phrasing (“burned bridges carefully”) keeps some emotions summarized rather than embodied at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation (redemption via transforming pressure) is clear and consistent, and her backstory colors her choices. Interiority is present but low in contradiction; she rarely wrestles with competing impulses once she commits. The “virtuously mischievous” trait aligns with her rule‑bending descent. The ending change is credible but paid with little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he intends to reveal a hidden truth and acts toward it with focused competence. However, there’s little internal contradiction or visible cost; calm confidence (“heart steady”) undercuts pressure. Micro‑choices exist (positioning, fine‑tuning, approaching the compartment), but they don’t test him emotionally. The earned change is external (document found) more than internal.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation (to “capture the shape of possibility”) and embodied response (trembling, tingling) ground the interiority. The desire/fear tension (courage and surrender) registers, though conflict remains mostly frictionless. His final reframing—returning as a “guardian of the spaces between realities”—is earned by prior acts but carries minimal on‑page cost. A deeper flaw or misbelief tested under pressure would raise stakes and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleanor’s grief, professionalism, and “tactfully hopeful” stance are concrete and guide her choices (dust analysis, documentation). The interior contradiction—choosing solitude yet seeking connection through records—reads clearly. Pressure is modest on the page, but her choices plausibly earn the quiet final kinship. Some emotional beats are summarized rather than dramatized, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s goal and competence are clear and her micro‑choices (using the TrueComm key, deploying cables, following the puddle‑map) align with a resourceful, underestimated rebel. Interiority is serviceable but thin; she rarely exhibits contradictory impulses or degradation under stress. Theodor adds a light relational crucible but exerts limited pressure beyond exposition and a prompt. The ending stance—grim resolve—feels earned but low‑cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and steady—Ethan aims to neutralize the prophecy—but internal contradiction is minimal, yielding a largely single‑vector psyche. Embodied detail (breath, instrument weight) helps, as do micro‑choices around silence and phrasing. The cost lands more as a subtle release than a felt sacrifice. The mentor memory adds texture but doesn’t force a competing value at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (decoding the leaves) is clear and her competence reads specific and embodied; the moonstone moment reveals values without grandstanding. However, pressure rarely fractures her composure, yielding little contradictory impulse under stress. The transformation confers advantage without visible price beyond a tingle. The role remains compelling but not yet tested.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s perfectionism versus a dawning acceptance drives credible choices (following the erratic compass, improvising the ladder). Interiority is clear and embodied at key beats (needle responds to anxiety/calm) though some feelings are told in abstractions. The final shift—embracing a “living rhythm”—is earned but the cost of renouncing precision reads more stated than felt. No secondary character pressure limits complexity but fits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—his guilt over Lumina and the lost coin drives concrete choices. The pivot from despair to making a new coin feels emotionally earned. However, the path to redemption is unusually smooth, with little on‑page resistance or contradictory impulse beyond initial regret. More friction during the forging would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear (free the child and prove laughter’s role) and tethered to lineage and his sister’s fate. Interiority is specific enough—tools, attention, patience—though internal contradiction is mild (he’s careful and “modestly fearless,” but rarely pressed). Micro‑choices (attuning device, using tooth, sitting carefully, bell timing) reveal values. The change—liberating Thomas and recommitting to this method—feels earned, if relatively low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kai’s interiority is embodied and specific—tremors, breath like glass, the strap as a trigger—driving micro‑choices (bracing, removing, aligning the strap). Motivation is clear and consistent: to make survival legible by finding a “mathematics of mercy.” Occasional clinical phrasing (“proprioceptively enhanced,” therapist reference) slightly flattens heat in peak beats. The final acceptance of cost—submitting to trauma responses to decode meaning—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—fulfilling a legacy by unlocking overlooked histories—but internal contradiction is minimal, making the journey feel preordained rather than hard-won. Embodied emotion appears (trembling fingers, fragment warming), yet micro‑choices under pressure are limited to the final touch. The lack of genuine doubt or competing impulse keeps the change from feeling costly. Still, the personal lineage with the grandmother grounds the drive credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motivations (obsessive vertical awareness, ghosts, and the 4:17 window) are clear and consistent, and his final decision to engage tracks with his setup. Interiority is particular (dust patterns, ceiling focus) but contradiction is light; he faces little internal ambivalence in the moment of choice. Embodied detail (smells, flicker, dust behavior) does some emotional work. The change from burden to calling lands, though the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—Eldon’s longing “to compress eternity into a single moment” and salvage a liquefied past drives his choices (placing the vial, preparing the press). Interiority skews declarative and conceptual rather than embodied; we get “fingers…trembled,” but little contradictory impulse in the scene. His agency is real at setup but attenuates once the whisper unbinds. The final acceptance (preserved/destroyed) lands, but the cost could deepen with more on‑page struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to transcend a violent binary through a poet’s intervention—is clear and consistent, and his small embodied choices (covering mirrors, tending the shard, writing through the storm) align with it. We get a believable shift from skepticism to using ritual, plus the ache of a failed revolutionary rechanneling his drive. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses are muted; the piece rarely tests him with a hard trade-off on the page. The endurance feels credible but low-cost relative to the stakes invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation and competence under pressure; tactile craft details ground Elias. However, interior contradiction is minimal and he encounters little doubt or failure en route to success. The “broken promise” realization arrives as a neat explanation rather than a dramatized struggle. The final endurance feels earned but light on visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—her lifelong fixation on transitional states logically drives the cave descent. Interiority is textured (the compass “pulses with purpose,” the “hinged awakenings”), but internal contradiction and on‑page cost are muted; she rarely struggles or doubts. Actions align with traits and tools, yet the epiphanic leaps verge on ease. The final shift reads earned but gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elena’s motive (seeking inspiration and orientation) is clear and carried through to the ending, but her interiority leans on labels (“perpetually learning,” “scaffold complexity with simplicity”) rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her choices—reaching into the archway, using the slide, building the sculpture—align with her stated aims but show little friction or cost. Emotional texture remains generalized; the revelations feel smooth rather than wrestled into. The final renunciation of GPS dependence reads more as a stated insight than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (traveling to the cathedral, studying the glass at night) align with her obsession. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific rather than generic. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are light; her pursuit faces minimal on‑page resistance. The change is credible but gentle, landing more as a reframed understanding than a hard‑won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ellara’s motivation is clear and consistent—an archivist driven to reconcile official histories with hidden truths—and her micro‑choices (demanding a detour, selecting debris, risking a ritual) align with that core. The embodied stress (“teargas in her throat,” trembling fingers) grounds her interiority. Internal contradiction is modest: the piece leans more on sustained conviction than competing impulses, which slightly flattens peak pressure. Her final shift—committing to daily parlays and publishing the unvarnished account—feels earned but lightly costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is crystal clear and sustained, but interiority leans abstract and declarative rather than embodied, with few contradictory impulses under pressure. The moment he reframes the bottle as a metaphor is credible but reads as a clean epiphany with limited felt cost. Micro‑choices (night drafting, posting notices) align, yet emotional texture is generalized. The lack of on‑page relational pressure keeps complexity modest.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives evolve persuasively from archivist to “archaeologist of human emotion,” and the prophecy credibly compels a new duty. Embodied moments (wax against temple, orchard air) ground interiority. The internal conflict—duty vs. apprehension—registers but doesn’t bite deeply enough to show a painful trade‑off. Still, the final renunciation of mere oath‑scribing reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—reopen the inherited vortex to “touch” borrowed time before her own runs out—and actions align (entropy‑ordering the seeds). The paradox of “furious tranquility” registers in body and tactic rather than label alone. Internal conflict is present but subtle; her acceptance of mortality is more stated than tested. Still, the final renaming of time’s “texture” as herself feels earned by the ritualized work.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive and lived‑in craft; Elias’s dedication feels specific and credible. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he never wavers or pays an acute on‑page price in the moment. Embodied emotion comes via tactile attention to rope and wind rather than dynamic struggle. The renunciation of modern systems hints at cost but remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elion’s curiosity and ritualized labor are clear, and his choice to abandon instruments for the “call” is motivated by established traits. However, interior conflict is muted—he rarely resists or doubts—so the turn costs little emotionally on the page. Embodied detail (the warmed glass, the void) helps, but some insights verge on label-like assertions. The change feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—the recluse seeks to honor a covenant by listening more than speaking—and actions align (placing the box under the oldest hive, later hushing travelers). Interiority is conveyed through sensory attention and pattern-reading more than explicit self-analysis, which fits the character. Internal contradiction (desire to understand vs. refusal of speech) is present but underplayed, keeping tension low. The final renunciation reads earned, though the struggle toward it is largely serene rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motive—understanding the texture of time—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (decoding, deciding to embed messages) align with it. However, interiority leans abstract and rarely shows contradictory impulses under pressure. The “weight of responsibility” is asserted more than dramatized. The closing acceptance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks “beauty in the incomplete”—and her micro‑choices (pausing to watch the kite, returning to the feather, placing it as a bookmark) align. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she rarely struggles against an opposing impulse, so the final acceptance costs little. The child’s cry provides a slight pressure test, but it doesn’t force a hard trade. The Earned Stasis reads credible, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—diagnosis to mission—but interior conflict is minimal, with “brazen calm” smoothing over contradictory impulses. Physical costs (arthritis, waning strength) are embodied and credible. Micro‑choices (learning the wire patterns, finishing the final circuit) align with values, though we rarely see doubt or misgiving. The earned renunciation at death lands, but the emotional pathway there feels mostly untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s motive is clear and consistent, and micro‑choices (skipping the detour, entering, surrendering the amber) align with his drive. However, interior conflict is mostly asserted rather than dramatized; the shift from “luminous skeptic” to believer lands swiftly with limited embodied struggle. The cost of leaving the prized specimen is underplayed emotionally. Still, the character reads specific and coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and steady—he aims to heal a poisoned battlefield—and his actions align (journeying, seeding, following bird guidance). Interiority is evocative but light on contradiction; he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses. The “dead languages” detail personalizes his method and worldview. Emotional cost registers mainly as exhaustion and depletion of seeds, not deep internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s motive (translate distance into closeness/find Elara) is clear, consistent, and drives his choices. His “bloodhound” perceptual angle personalizes interiority, especially in decoding the grooves. However, internal contradiction and on‑page emotional struggle are light; he rarely wavers or pays a visible interpersonal price. The final endurance/change is credible but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s interiority—ostracized yet driven—reads clearly, and the isolation/purpose contradiction holds. However, her on‑page choices (sketching as ritual) don’t face a live test that forces a costly trade‑off. Emotions are mostly told in elevated diction rather than embodied action. The final acceptance feels earned but modest in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motives are clear (prove worth, fix the sky) and his “chivalrous thief” code personalizes the setup, but in-scene contradiction is thin and his path is rarely pressured. His interiority (“heart both racing and calm”) skims rather than embodies stress; success comes too smoothly. The master’s late arrival removes chances for Kael’s flawed impulses to complicate the climax. The final choice reads competent rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to witness and preserve small gestures against erasure—is clear, embodied in her ritual walking and focus on the pawn. The internal contradiction (benevolent yet ruthless; she cannot save all) surfaces credibly in “one small gesture speaks for many.” Choices (to spell “witness,” to accept selective preservation) align with her history as crisis actor/survivor. Emotional texture is specific, though a few thesis-like lines edge toward declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“to understand the shape of home”) and a coherent inner lens, but limited contradiction or struggle under pressure. Maven accepts her powers quickly and rarely faces a live trade‑off. Interiority is evocative yet generalized at peak beats. The change is credible, though the felt cost is light.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear motive (redemption) aligns with precise tactics (decoding threads under a four‑minute window), and we feel the long cost (forty years of penance). Interiority is specific to a tutor’s strategic mind, though some insights arrive a touch neatly (“redemption had been his all along”). Micro‑choices under pressure land (working faster with two minutes left). The reconciliation with the prince offers a credible, earned shift rather than a free absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and small choices (gathering dissenters at dawn, climbing the highest tower) align with it. However, interiority leans generalized (“The truth cannot be contained”) rather than character‑particular, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The threat of Overseers is externalized but never embodied in a live crucible moment. The cost is acknowledged but not felt through a difficult, on‑page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcel’s motive—to wrest meaning from uncertainty—drives concrete micro-choices (breath-holding, tracing pockmarks, narrating losses). Interiority is textured and embodied (etched glass, acid sea, callused fingers), avoiding stock feeling labels. The final stance shift (kintsugi acceptance) is earned by the ritual process, though the turn is more reflective than contested. Slight tidiness in the epiphany trims ambiguity around cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motive—to capture a perfect image that outlasts memory and grief—is clear and consistent, and his choices (taking the path, claiming the shell, returning to paint) align. Interiority is specific (the storm-cracked mirror, the harbor counts dwindling), though his “aloofness” seldom exerts pressure beyond tone. The final resolve reads a touch tidy, but the cost (age, loss, fading memory) is felt. More simultaneous contradiction under pressure would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motivation and embodied feeling (the jasmine, the cork’s warmth) ground Elias, but he faces minimal resistance and little internal contradiction. His “screaming tenderness” is vivid yet untested by a meaningful obstacle. Captain Morgan offers status pressure, not true opposition. The ending shows change, but at low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motives are clear (guide ships home; make meaning from loss) and embodied in scars and ritual, with credible micro-choices (reconfiguring gear, using the censer as anchor). Contradictory impulses (pride/sorrow, faith/skepticism) are present but softly rendered rather than dramatized under peak pressure. Emotional texture is particular to this navigator, though true internal conflict never quite forces a painful tradeoff. Still, actions and reactions align cleanly with the established psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—shielding herself from overwhelming empathy—is clear and consistent, and her rituals and micro‑choices (naming others, finally naming herself) are well motivated. The rational/mystic contradiction (truffle forager trusting discredited texts) gives her texture. Some interiority leans abstract/clinical (“psychological safety,” “empathic overflow”), softening embodied conflict. The emotional cost is felt in her tears and chosen solitude, but ambiguity and mess are kept tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s eccentricity is specific and enacted: spyglass, ledgers, lantern, and star‑talk frame his perception and choices. His quiet need—decoding the gesture to relieve isolation—drives concrete actions (investigation, returning to the dock, mirroring the gesture). Internal contradiction (cherished solitude vs. hunger for connection) is present, if understated. The final renunciation of guarded isolation reads earned and scaled to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s loneliness, vocation, and mentor’s promise give him clear motives, and his choice in the cavern credibly concludes that drive. Interiority is present and filtered through his map‑maker mindset, but contradictory impulses under peak pressure are muted; the decision reads calm and tidy. The ants, chip, and cave all reveal facets of him through action. The cost—relinquishing old patterns—lands, though it feels conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s disenchantment and hunger for meaning motivate her decisions cleanly (dismissing guards, choosing the climb, entering the grotto). Interiority is present but light; fear and desire coexist only briefly (“drawn and terrified”) without sustained contradiction under pressure. Maera functions more as midwife than pressure, so the relationship crucible is gentle. The change—renewed purpose—feels earned but pays a modest cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and credible—anxiety vs. anticipation, physics vs. poetry—and her micro‑choices (waiting, handling the shell, choosing a gentlest technique) reveal values. The relationship pressure is underused: Leo’s “secret” never forces an on‑page trade‑off beyond a vow to reframe her craft. Still, her renunciation of her prior approach feels earned by the moment’s intensity. The cost is mostly conceptual and relational, lightly felt rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with credible contradictions (envying past selves while despising their naivety). Micro‑choices are small but motivated—tracing symbols, accepting the pull, then recommitting to the chronicle. The emotional progression from awe to acceptance lands without therapy‑speak. The cost is endurance rather than a dramatic renunciation, but it feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in tactile work; her anosmia meaningfully reshapes how she reads people via objects. The micro‑choices—waving Lena in, handling the screw as if it carried memory, sharing loss—align with motive and reveal character under pressure. The relationship dynamic is tender and credible, though a few lines edge toward platitude. The closing warmth feels earned, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, embodied stakes and interiority: Elara’s trembling, breath‑holding, and ritualized tea/quill prep show contradictory impulses (panic vs. discipline) under pressure. Her affliction and grandmother‑seeded superstition create specific, character‑particular tactics. The final choice—returning to childhood teachings to halt crystallization—feels earned and alters her stance. Minor tell lines exist, but motivation and micro‑choices remain coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eloise’s guilt-driven motive to apologize and reconnect is specific and embodied in actions (perfume, wiring, rheostat), with credible ambivalence under pressure. The relationship crucible with Beatrice lands in subtext (“scissors cut clean… jagged edges”). Internal contradictions are present but lightly handled; we mostly get poise over rupture. The final acceptance-with-cost reads earned and forecloses easy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent—unify scattered truths before the hiccup ends—but interior conflict is minimal and largely abstract. The strongest character beat is the body gaining substance from integrated truths, hinting at a cost. Micro‑choices are few (the altar placement is the lone concrete act). Emotional texture leans declarative rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlo’s drive to “understand what clocks really measure” is specific, embodied in careful actions (avoiding razor edges, turning the hidden aperture) and culminates in a credible renunciation (vowing never to use the key conventionally). Interiority is consistent and particular, with sensory attention tied to his craft. The change is modest but earned, reframing his daily duty and relationship to silence. Some inner conflict remains under-articulated, keeping stakes primarily conceptual rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—balancing protection and connection—is clear and her micro-choices (adjusting parameters, stepping out) align with it. Interiority is present with a distinct sensory bias, yet conflict reads relatively smooth with limited friction or mistake-making. The “quiet wildfire” feeling helps, but the epiphany borders on tidy. A bit more contradictory impulse under pressure would have deepened credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interior is textured—caught between gambler father and rigorous theory—and her micro‑choices (rushing back to the library, deciding not to “decode” but to reframe) align with that tension. The contradiction is embodied in tactile anchors (mica pane, weighted dice). The change is a quiet renunciation rather than a bold act, so the on‑page cost is subtle. Still, motivation is consistent and deepens credibly to the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motive—self‑exile after loss—tracks cleanly into the choice to answer and truly engage with Meredith. The interiority is mostly told rather than pressured on the page, but the contradiction (cultivated estrangement vs. urge to help “endings begin”) is legible. The emotional change at the end feels a touch easy, with limited embodied cost beyond a stated readiness to connect. Still, his micro‑choices (answering, sustaining the call, reframing the booth’s purpose) align with his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear interior drive—preserving “small moments”—is embodied in exacting ritual and the final renunciation. Contradictory impulses (“haunted euphoria”) act simultaneously and guide micro‑choices (mixing powders, timing the steep, drawing, sealing, leaving). The cost of endurance registers as obsolescence accepted with pain. Slight safety in always‑admirable competence limits the messiness of flaw under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Archie’s motive—engineering connection to counter his own loneliness—is clear and drives his choice to seed the rumor; the jocular mask versus private ache creates a credible internal contradiction. Micro-choices (the mirror rehearsal, forging certificates, activating the taxi network) align with his traits. However, much of the pressure is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, muting embodied struggle. The ethical cost of deception is implied more than confronted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elion’s grief-motivated quest is clear and coherent, and the actions (dowsing, following the notes, kneeling at the stillpoint) align with his motives. Contradictory impulses (gift/burden; grief/acceptance) are present, though the struggle feels preordained rather than hard-won. Interiority is embodied via tactile perception, but his transition to acceptance is smooth and low-friction. A touch more resistance or error under pressure would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—guilt ripening into determination—is clear and consistently expressed through the pen choice and the “confidently uncertain” posture. Interiority is specific (workshop, heart flutter, velvet case), if slightly safe; little in-scene resistance tests her limits. Micro-choices exist (how to phrase the suggestion, whether to act at all), but pressure remains mild. The closing vow feels earned yet low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s desire and method are clear and consistent, and the maternal lineage grounds his motive. Earned Stasis lands: he chooses to give voice to others while accepting being forgotten. However, interior contradiction is light; he scarcely struggles or wavers on the page. The young woman scene offers embodied empathy but not a pressured choice that reveals deeper fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s guilt‑driven motivation is clear and specific, and her arsonist past credibly informs how she reads damage and restoration. Interiority is concrete (trembling fingers; the bridge between destruction and renewal) and choices track her values. The internal conflict is present but resolves a bit tidily once the hidden message is found. The price—self‑exile underground and sustained repair—reads, though the struggle is mostly summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s goal and tactics are clear and character‑specific (the rhythmic “quiet rebellion” becomes her method of escape and summoning). Interiority is embodied through touch, rhythm, and the garden’s sensory feedback, though contradictory impulses are muted—she rarely hesitates. The cost is felt as temporariness and risk rather than a concrete consequence. Relationship texture with Theo is moving but largely one‑sided in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlo’s motive—to outmaneuver Vance by proving whispers beat shouts—is clear and consistent with his long-cultivated competencies. Interiority is grounded in tactile habits (maps, coin, key) and a specific perceptual quirk (identifying walks). However, internal contradiction and visible cost under pressure are minimal, so growth reads as confirmation rather than change. The on-page interaction with Vance skims status tension without fully testing Marlo’s limits.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    The guardian’s motive (to “teach darkness the value of stars”) is clear and embodied through precise, ritualized action; the visitor’s burden is legible in posture and hesitation. Interiority is minimal and largely projected through behavior, limiting contradiction and micro‑choice texture. The silent exchange at the end earns a small endurance/renunciation cost (secret remains unspoken). Strong presence, modest depth.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arthur’s motive is precise and character‑specific—reviving curiosity against a rigid pedagogy—and his telepathic sensitivity grounds his choice. However, internal conflict and cost are underplayed; he encounters little resistance and pays no visible price. Interiority leans to summary rather than embodied contradiction. The result is clear but emotionally low‑friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s yearning and “combative tenderness” are embodied through work-etched grace, the scrimshaw’s pull, and the final renunciation. Her motive—liberation from expectations—is consistent and intensifies toward the dive. The internal conflict (fear/hope) is present on the page, especially as the scrimshaw’s pieces reveal “aspects of herself.” A few abstract formulations (“true nature could find perfect expression”) slightly dilute the otherwise specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is explicit and coherent—he cultivates “lightness in grief” through whittling and ritualized narration—while the fraud/saint tension gives credible moral ambiguity. Interiority is filtered through action and image rather than abstract labels, with the dried flowers and the blank face functioning as embodied contradictions. However, in‑scene pressure on his choices is mild; there’s little moment‑to‑moment testing beyond declarations. The endurance at the end reads earned but not hard‑won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and steady—freedom from suppression and crossing “sacred” limits—culminating in the deliberate touch and paraphrase. Interiority is present but largely assured, with little contradictory impulse or real hesitation on the page. Embodied beats (heart pounding, vibration filling the being) land, but the struggle feels low-friction. The change is credible, though the personal cost is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive—bartering an awakening for Gideon—reads clear and consistent, and her plant‑language choices align with that desire. Interiority is present but largely serene; little on‑page ambivalence or struggle undercuts depth. The “innocently cunning” trait surfaces in how others avoid interrupting her patterns, but we don’t see it complicate a decision with visible cost. The end registers a change, yet the emotional price is conceptual more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear motivation and competence are present, but interior contradiction and on‑page cost are minimal. Her “powerfully gentle” touch and curiosity guide micro‑choices (placing the lens, activating the resonator) without visible pressure or risk. Emotional embodiment leans abstract rather than particular. The arc resolves into continuation rather than a change that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elena’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized through micro‑choices under pressure. Her grief and endurance read credible, yet contradictions and embodied conflict rarely surface in scene. The strongest characterizing detail is her ritual use of the phoenix stencil, which reveals value hierarchy without a present‑tense test. The final renunciation/endurance registers, but the cost is stated more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—mapping cultural patterns via cartomancy—is clear and embodied through tactile actions with the tape and cards. His brief hesitation before confiding offers a modest but real micro‑conflict that results in a choice. Interiority is concrete if somewhat thesis‑driven; the visitor remains underdrawn as a pressure source. The change—accepting collaboration and the burden of prevention—is credible but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive to recover forbidden knowledge is clear and consistently embodied through tactile, anti‑pattern choices. The internal contradiction—historian trained to find patterns forced to avoid them—plays on the page rather than being merely stated. “Anguish and joy” recur as a lived tension in action, not only summary. The final merging registers as a costly, earned endurance rather than a neat triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (“preserve the shape of hope”) is clear and coherently drives her watchfulness, with embodied moments (stone in pocket, tightened grip) grounding the interiority. Agency is mostly attentional and archival rather than decisional, but it suits the accumulative design. The recognition of the shadow’s identity reconfigures her mission with a real emotional cost. Minor limitation: internal conflict is more stated than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—rebuilding trust while preserving compassion—is clear and coherently embodied in her care for the injured chameleon. The internal conflict is credible and sustained, with small micro‑choices (handling, releasing, observing) revealing values under strain. A touch of abstract phrasing (“reconstruct my understanding,” “balance self‑respect and compassion”) dilutes some immediacy. Still, the final stance feels earned and forecloses naïveté with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive and flaw (a “closure seeker” who opens wounds) are clear and anchored in concrete perception (cold stone, shiver, plant-voices). The internal turn to “integration” is earned by object-patterns and plant pleas, but the transition reads smooth and low-friction. Contradictory impulses are gestured at rather than dramatized under pressure. The cost—renouncing her old method—lands conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motive—locating and releasing “unused love”—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile engagement with the film. Interiority is specific to her craft (sprocket holes, silver halide), though her emotional trajectory faces little counter‑pressure or contradiction. The promise “I’ll give you voice again” lands as a credible, character‑driven pledge. Cost is present but light (a tear, reverence), limiting the depth of change.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—freeing stifled creativity—reads clean and specific, and her overwhelm from “unspoken words” gives credible pressure. The embodied pivot (aligning the star, tracing paths) arises from her traits and backstory. Internal conflict is present but tidy; there’s little messy contradiction beyond fatigue versus longing. The bittersweet admission of missed vision adds needed cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear motive (tending “unlit corners”) and a credible internal tension between being “occasionally everywhere” and becoming present; the Archivist’s rebuke sharpens this. Actions align with motive (unlocking the archive, placing the clock, departing). Emotional texture is largely abstract and lofty, with little embodied stress. The closing shift (“Perhaps I’ve begun”) feels earned by the clock’s tick but the cost is lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he seeks to explore his inner frontier—and his actions (following the winds, placing the gear, choosing to sleep again) align. However, internal conflict is minimal and emotions skew abstract (“wonder,” “insight”) rather than embodied. The epiphany feels earned by pattern but lacks a felt cost or contradiction at the peak. Absence of relational pressure keeps characterization relatively one‑note.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maris’s resolve and the collective “we” create a steady interior lens with clear motivation, but internal contradiction and cost are muted. The line “courage we seek is not the kind that battles monsters” skews declarative, reducing lived tension. Micro-choices (pushing off, stamping, entering the waterfall) align with motive. The final acceptance of dragons reframes their role but doesn’t reveal a personal flaw or sacrifice beyond duty.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, embodied interiority (nerve tingles, warmth in stone) grounds a credible shift from resignation to agency. The push-pull between sanctuary safety and risking the world’s discord reads as a live internal conflict. Small, tactile micro-choices (examining discoloration, pulling the bolt, tracing melody) reveal values under pressure. A faint overstatement of insight trims edge (“safety wasn’t the absence of danger”).

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s drive to unmask the pretender and her fear of ruling are clearly articulated, and her ritual choice under pressure aligns with those motives. However, contradictory impulses rarely act simultaneously on the page; much of her interior struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The final realization risks tidiness, arriving as a declarative truth more than a contested discovery. Still, the identity shift reads earned by the pattern of messages and the mounting collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motives (to witness, to understand “why some paths disappear”) are clear and consistent, with tactile habits (tapping, sleepless data work) grounding her interiority. The drift/moor contradiction gives her a credible internal tension that informs micro-choices. However, the pressure rarely forces a costly decision beyond acceptance; the arc leans contemplative over conflicted. Still, actions align with motives and culminate in an earned, quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist’s longing and tactile presence (bare feet, opera glasses) are specific, but internal conflict is thin; she moves steadily from seeking to certainty without friction. “She understood that she was the meaning” reads as an asserted epiphany rather than earned through contradictory impulses under pressure. The “awkwardly confident” trait is stated more than dramatized with cost. Her decisive moves—approaching, stepping in, raising arms—align with motives, but ambiguity and struggle are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s drive and worldview shift (from rejecting prophecy to embracing “implanted destiny”) are clear and consistent, and her choices (decoding, descent, speaking the words) align under pressure. However, internal conflict is summarized more than dramatized; we don’t feel a lived contradiction tested on the page at the peak. Embodied emotion appears (“weathered hands,” plant whispers) but the climactic moment leans declarative rather than conflicted. A visible personal cost (risk, sacrifice, or a foreclosed path) is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s interiority is grounded in embodied cues (jaw, breath) and micro-choices (stopping work, hands in earth, breath work), culminating in the costly release of the photograph. The contradiction between clinging and letting go is credible and present on the page. The “somatic markers” register edges toward clinical diction but remains dramatized through action. Overall, a coherent, specific portrait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, embodied interiority and credible motives (recover the lost spark) drive concrete actions (retrieving the box, untangling threads, returning to charcoal). The contradiction between paralysis and the urge to “descend into necessary darkness” is active on the page. The final acceptance of imperfection feels earned by the process work. A touch of declarative self‑explanation slightly blunts complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, focused motivation drives choices (the experiment, stepping into the ink), and cost lands on return with destabilized vitals. Interiority is specific enough (“serene anger,” isolation, professional rigor), though contradictory impulses are lightly rendered. A few label-forward lines (“Their albinism wasn’t just physical—…”) flatten nuance. Still, actions align with motive and the ending registers an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied (breath stabilizers, hammering heart), and her decisive choice reads earned under pressure. The internal conflict—duty versus revelation—acts simultaneously rather than in tidy alternation. A few on‑the‑nose lines (“Knowledge cries out to be free”) skim toward thesis‑speak. Still, micro‑choices (accessing dormant networks, accepting consequences) reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhiannon’s motives (to nurture amid collapse, in tension with her bounty-hunter lineage) are clear and consistent, with tactile choices like tending cuttings and repurposing the sandbag. Interiority is specific—humidity shifts, withered petals—yet the internal contradiction remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized under present pressure. The “burden” of her perception is told more than felt in a hard choice. The ending registers an earned endurance rather than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, patient motivation and competence under pressure read strongly, but interior contradiction is minimal and the cost of success is soft. He adapts tactics (zigzagging, voicing silence) with poise, yet we see little embodied doubt or fraying under strain. The throughline is compelling but emotionally buffered. A deeper friction between want and cost would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation (honoring her father by testing the journalist’s theory) is clear and consistent, and her method-driven agency anchors the piece. However, the internal conflict is mild; she shifts from doubt to solution without a real on-page struggle or costly misstep. Embodied emotion lands in tactile details (pen nib, echoes), but contradictions in her interiority are limited. The final decision feels earned but carries little immediate personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (ten‑year guilt, deafness) drives concrete choices: he modifies the firmware and initiates the tether. Interiority is embodied through tactile work (needles, ink, code as constellations). The arc from haunted listening to earned stillness convinces, though contradictory impulses under peak pressure are lightly sketched—he meets little on‑page resistance. The final act of inking musical notes seals a credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motivation (to find meaning in the mess) is clear and enacted through specific, choice-driven artmaking. His key agency—interjecting via the mandala—aligns with the “socially perceptive” trait and avoids didactic confrontation. Interiority is evocative but limited; conflict within him is more implied than dramatized, keeping the arc slightly friction-light. The small but real cost—disassembling the mandala and renouncing ownership—lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and embodied through the ritual of renaming; Elias’s micro-choices (picking the tessera, finding the void, tracing patterns) align with his values. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he reads as serenely purposeful, with little on-page friction. Emotional embodiment is mostly atmospheric rather than conflicted. The final stance is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive (restore the garden/timeline before dawn) is clear and rooted in his identity as an encore‑seeking tenor. The interiority is concrete via his synesthetic perceptions and the charged relationship to the tarot coin and stage. A credible tension exists between his attachment to endless encores and the hinted cost of release, culminating in his dissolution. However, in‑scene contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maya’s drive (help her brother/recall victims) is clear and embodied through tactile attention to pulse, chills, and finger urges under pressure. The affectionate skeptic contradiction operates in scene and resolves credibly into conviction. Micro‑choices (arranging lights, adjusting lenses, documenting somatic markers) align with motive. Cost is mostly emotional and stamina, not deeply dramatized, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Maya seeks to be “the voice of the unknown”—and her choices (descending, touching, accepting the fossil) align. However, interiority leans declarative (“She realized it had been waiting for her”) with little contradictory impulse or embodied cost. The moment she’s “chosen” lacks friction or hesitation that would test her values. Minimal on‑page struggle blunts character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict and visible cost are minimal. Her shift from solitary worker to community guide feels more declared than earned through strain. Micro‑choices (cataloging, arranging) show character, yet they face little resistance. The ending presents growth without a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (wind, mist, the gaunt frame) and the spy’s fracture is rendered through concrete rituals (the pillbox, snow codes). The competing impulses—numb resignation vs. protective resolve for his daughter—coexist on the page. The final renunciation/acceptance feels earned by the ritualized buildup. Occasional aphoristic lines risk genericization but don’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coachman’s vocation and quiet devotion read specific and credible, with tactile micro‑choices (waiting on the gutters, stitching despite a prick) revealing character. Motivation is coherent—keeper of thresholds honoring the “palimpsest promise.” However, internal contradiction is mild; he rarely wrestles with competing impulses beyond endurance. Emotional cost registers mostly as solitude and duty, not a pressured trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motive is clear and consistent, and his choices (using potter’s tools, orienting the glass, tending the earth) align with his identity. Interiority is restrained and largely inferential; he lacks a live contradictory impulse or visible doubt under pressure. The emotional texture (“sharp gentleness”) is vivid but uniform. The closing resolve to return reads earned but low-cost, leaning more toward confirmation than change.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s motive (to bring light into darkness) is clear, grounded in her temperament and legacy, and expressed through tangible micro‑choices (packing the bag, choosing the alcove, methodically reflecting light). Interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding generic labels. The coincidence of meeting Jim is convenient, but it reframes rather than resolves the pressure and reveals lineage credibly. The final stance crystallization (accepting purpose) feels earned, though the on‑page cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (to translate isolation into independence) is clear and consistent, with an internal contradiction between Aethenian control and learned coexistence. Interiority is mostly told rather than embodied, but the touch on the reflective wall and sensitivity to the stone‑hum give some tactile anchoring. The final renunciation of control reads earned but the cost is conceptual more than felt. Strong presence, limited micro‑choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to repair a depleted creative self) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices—entering the installation, reaching for the nest, deciding to write for herself—align with that drive. Interiority feels particular in sensory focus (rain‑pearled petals, “tingle of recognition”), though the repeated label “inevitably whimsical” reads told rather than shown at times. The change at the end (foreclosing formulaic ghosting) is credible but the on‑page cost is modest. A sharper contradiction under pressure would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear, and her obsession vs. caution provides a credible internal tension. We see embodied stress (hair rising, breath held) and micro‑choices culminating in the risky activation. The cost is mostly conceptual (risk of attracting tricksters, isolation), lightly felt on the page. Secondary relationship pressure (Merrick) is off‑stage, muting crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature inform concrete tactics (waiting for the fallow period, centering herself, enduring pain) and culminate in a risky, identity-altering step through the portal. Interiority is specific—breath discipline, tactile handling of the compass, organ-memory—rather than labeled. The internal contradiction (fear vs. defiance) acts in the moment of pain and transfixion. The cost is credible but could be sharpened by a clearer on‑page loss beyond the tool’s relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s motivation (solve the cold case to awaken empathy) is clear and consistent, and her prosopagnosia gives her a specific perceptual signature. Her methodical choices (measuring, cross-referencing, calling for schematics) align with her traits. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and she encounters little resistance; competence dominates struggle. The ending claims emotional stakes but shows little on‑page cost or conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eli’s motive (redeeming the ancestor) is specific and consistent, and the “nervous confidence” shows in embodied choices (trembling, pressing the nail) under pressure. The internal conflict between duty and dread is legible without melodrama. However, emotion is sometimes summarized (“spongey dread”) rather than newly dramatized, limiting texture. Relationship pressure from Dr. Aris is present but light.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to answer an invitation toward redemption and outgrow a legacy wound—is clear and consistent. His observational habit grounds concrete reactions (pine scent, glass flake, scaffold map). However, internal contradiction is light; he moves toward the crossing with minimal resistance or cost on the page. The brother backstory adds texture but doesn’t actively torque a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives (protecting the company, redefining his legacy) are clear and consistent, with a credible endurance arc. The Marcus scene shows status dynamics and how his calm functions under pressure. Internal conflict is present but mostly told rather than dramatized. The final renunciation (bankruptcy, donation, departure) reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive to decode for healing is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (adjusting the telescope, choosing to share the burden with Thorne) align with that aim. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she rarely exhibits simultaneous competing impulses under pressure. Emotions are often declared rather than embodied, and her “gift to heal with words” activates without friction or visible cost. The relationship with Thorne offers warmth but exerts little pressure to reveal deeper flaws or values in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation (free the mentor) drives concrete choices, and the blood offering registers as a tangible cost. Interiority is steady but narrow; “warlike serenity” reads more as a label than a live contradiction under pressure. Competence dominates with little visible doubt or error, limiting complexity. The final acceptance of the mentor’s identity lands but feels more conceptual than psychologically fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and steady—restore the covenant by finding the intersection of dreams—and the ritual choice is consistent with a visionary who is both grounded and curious. Interiority leans archetypal rather than idiosyncratic, but embodied touches (linking scars, scale‑shift into the maze) give it texture. Internal conflict is present as “anxious elation,” though it seldom forces a hard trade‑off. The final repricing (coexistence vs. separation) reads earned but with limited on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to mend escaped sorrow—reads clear and consistent, with specific embodied actions (placing the card, tracing symbols). “Reckless idealist” versus learned patience hints at a credible internal contradiction, though conflict remains mostly summarized, not dramatized as competing impulses. Her competence faces little genuine friction; the memory resists but yields quickly, muting cost. Still, micro‑choices under pressure track to her “fierce gentleness” in a coherent way.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured: competence layered over grief and shame, with micro-choices (examining the weave, voicing “I’d need to see more,” admitting “Close to nothing”) revealing values under pressure. His contradictory impulses—professional rigor vs. longing for past noise—are dramatized through tactile action. The final act of sealing and labeling reads as an earned, modest reclaiming with felt cost. Pressure is quiet, not searing, but credible for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and particular: a cautious, analogical mind carrying a generational burden. Contradictory impulses (“exhilarated and terrified”) show on the page, and she makes a concrete choice to act (packing, boarding). The embodied connection to the seed gives her interiority a tactile anchor. The cost of her stance is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive (preserve wonder) and an embodied contradiction (self migrating with the moon) give the librarian particularity, and choices (smelt, submit to the tide) align with that drive. However, pressure rarely forces micro-choices with visible cost; the stance of acceptance is largely declared. Interiority is specific but contemplative rather than conflicted-in-the-moment. The synthesis at the end feels earned but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation (from inspector to healer) and embodied beats (lifting the pearl, donning the crown) land, but the inner conflict is too frictionless—“a heartbeat of hesitation” is the only explicit resistance. The transformation feels earned by discovery, though the cost is mostly conceptual. A slightly over-tidy epiphany tone blunts complexity. Still, the role pivot credibly redefines her actions and values.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motives (self-forgiveness after her brother’s death) are clear and actions align (researching graffiti, descending to the tunnels, playing the accordion). Interiority is concrete and character‑specific, filtered through her river‑chronicler lens. Contradictory impulses surface (methodical caution versus surrender to grief), though a few theme-forward lines edge toward tidy realization. The final acceptance costs her emotionally and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and sustained (the drive to find and mine the library), with embodied trepidation versus hunger shaping small choices (raising the watch, selecting the manuscript, rushing to document). Interiority is vivid but largely untested by a hard dilemma; the cost remains conceptual rather than forcing a painful trade. The anonymous “veiled dreamer” voice is consistent yet keeps the character at an archetypal distance. The final shift—keeping the knowledge as an unspoken secret—lands but doesn’t expose a deeper flaw or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—preserve the violin’s “dream” against imperial seizure—is clear and consistent, and her field‑honed methods (calipers, audio array) reveal character under pressure. The plant‑telepathy adds embodied anxiety (the desert rose’s “pricks”) and guides tactics. Internal contradiction is subtler—she aches and fears loss yet operates with high competence—so struggle feels a bit friction‑light. The sacrifice of the original violin lands as an earned cost and crystallizes her values.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive—redemption through preservation after failing her sister—is clear and coherently drives every action. Interiority is steady and character‑particular, but there’s little on‑page contradiction or struggle; competence goes largely untested. Micro‑choices (placing the stone, attending to scents, deciding completion) are thoughtful yet low‑pressure. The endurance ending (continuing the work) lands but with limited felt cost in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (seeking peace beyond forgiveness), and the hairpin rituals externalize interiority. However, internal conflict rarely bites—her “kindly decisive” stance faces little friction beyond effort. The realization reads a touch declared rather than earned by on‑page struggle. Micro‑choices (pause, enter, remove hairpin) are present but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motives and contradictions are clear: he “welcomes nuance into certainty” while longing to drop his “cloak of doubt,” yet chooses endurance. Embodied actions (chime selection, handling the shard) reveal character under pressure. The relationship with the fisherman is lightly sketched but functional; the reluctant acceptance shows credible impact. The cost—maintaining detachment despite desire for vulnerability—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elien’s motive (teach the paradox) and Maya’s trustful confusion are clear and consistent, and the teacher–student dynamic drives the scene. However, interior contradiction is light: Maya moves from confusion to insight with minimal embodied struggle or cost on the page. The “payment” of Elien’s decade is strong but mostly conceptual; Maya’s price is implied. A touch more friction in Maya’s process would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and specific—“to learn to navigate without moving”—and his choices (following the crows, placing the arrowhead, arranging the stones) align with it. Interiority is textured but largely reverential; contradictory impulses and on-page struggle are minimal, which softens pressure. The emotional cost registers in his disappearance, though the path there feels serene rather than contested. Still, embodied details (bare feet in dust, trembling hands) ground the reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—an underachieving mage seeking the sacred beyond automation—and his choices (forbidden mist walking, unstrapping the Regulation Pack) align. Interiority is present but leans on generalized epiphany language, with limited contradictory impulses in-scene. The removal of the pack functions as a credible renunciation with felt cost. More on-page friction or missteps under pressure would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Hemingway’s desire to understand his synesthetic gift is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (taking the key, opening the door, accepting the vow) align with that drive. Interiority is present but largely told; he faces minimal internal contradiction in the moment. The relationship with the librarian offers light pressure rather than real crucible. The cost (the key dissolving into his skin and accepting responsibility) lands but with little struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear (interpret the cosmic static via coins to decide humanity’s fate), and his “quiet enthusiasm” versus creeping doubt gives a modest internal tension. However, his interiority leans abstract (“wavelength align with purpose”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final decision feels competent rather than hard-won, with limited sense of cost or sacrifice. Korin adds slight interpersonal pressure but doesn’t force a relational pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular interiority—his need to “give names to nameless fears” grows credibly from grief and memory (“Her name was Elara”). Embodied actions (tracing the tentacle, naming Solitude) align with motive. The change to quiet purpose is earned, though the relief is perhaps a touch tidy. Contradictory impulses (love and duty, fear and control) flicker but could press harder on a live trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent: a self‑doubting mage persists to mend the bell and the sea. The contradiction—lukewarm competence versus brittle devotion—animates his choices and culminates in a subtle inner warming. Emotions are embodied through tactile attention to water and stone, though cost beyond exertion remains modest. The change feels earned but not scalding.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thomas’s motive evolves credibly from stewardship to redress once the photographs reveal his aunt, and his concrete actions (calls, petitions) align. Interiority is specific enough (the label stirring a “forgotten memory”) but the internal tension is relatively smooth, with limited on‑page struggle. The admission that he had “unwittingly upheld” a false narrative gives moral cost, though the conflict remains largely internal and lightly pressured. A touch more embodied contradiction under pressure would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (harmonize logic and intuition) and the sentimental counter‑current adds dimension, but she faces little real inner resistance in the moment. Interiority is present yet safe; the “secretly sentimental” trait surfaces without altering tactics. Actions align with motives, though the path feels unopposed. The ending shift reads as fulfillment more than a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s duty, dread, and resolve are legible through concrete micro-choices (tilting the receiver, inputting codes, tightening the buckle, preparing the tether, transmitting). Motivation is coherent (“preserve trust”) and intensifies when anomalies contradict patterns. Internal contradiction—fear versus responsibility—surfaces credibly, though it rarely pressures a single decisive trade-off. More embodied, idiosyncratic reaction under peak stress would deepen specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s motive (vivify the duplicate and overcome numbness) is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices—approaching the jar, channeling vitality, choosing to feel pain. Embodied touches (“hands trembling,” “cool glass”) anchor her interiority. The transformation to “bridge between opposites” lands but reads a touch tidy and declarative. Minor therapy‑speak abstractions dilute the messiness of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to safeguard space for innovation—is clear and consistent, and her planting of the seed aligns with it. However, her interiority leans abstract; we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied stress beyond generalized calm resolve. The visible cost (resisting commercial demand) is asserted rather than dramatized. As a result, the change reads thoughtful but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motive—to break the house’s oppressive quiet and recover a trace of lost laughter—is clear and embodied through tactile, acoustic choices (modulating throttle, lowering the blower). The internal texture (“mournfully eager”) is specific, not clinical, and his actions align with grief-charged hope. Contradictory impulses (drive to restore vs. acceptance of absence) surface credibly at the end. Slight narrowness—no secondary pressure or pronounced self‑deception—keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guardian’s longing and discipline are clear, and the choice to “draw the magical forces…not to possess or control” aligns with a credible internal ethic. However, emotion skews abstract; contradictory impulses are asserted more than embodied, and the cost of leaving is felt conceptually, not viscerally. Micro‑choices exist (gazing, waiting, focusing, stepping forward) but rarely show messy hesitation in-scene. Strong motivation, softened by generalization.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s drive—to break his family’s preserving destiny—guides every choice, with embodied conflict between reverence and the courage to destroy. The collected tears and trembling hands ground emotion beyond labels. His shift from repair to transformation is earned by prior failures. Slight safety in the tidy self‑diagnosis (“not magic but evolution”) trims edge.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her method—quieting inner/external noise—aligns with her identity. However, internal conflict remains mild; she renounces assumptions without palpable struggle or contradictory impulse on the page. Embodied sensations (wind in hair, pulse with the fragment) help but the arc leans competent and serene over pressured and fraught. The earned shift is credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and specific (childhood split) and aligns with on‑page choices (radioing Althea, triggering the sequence). Interiority is steady but low in contradiction—his “resilient positivity” rarely meets a counter‑impulse, so pressure on character is light. Embodied details (patterns glowing, hourglass handled) help, yet the arc lands without visible struggle. The final “permanent transient” identity feels earned conceptually more than emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and personal (finding his sister), and his key choice—touching the tapestry—aligns with that drive. Interiority skews conceptual over embodied, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional texture is present (awe, longing), but the arc leans on declared belief rather than dramatized internal conflict. The final realization feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict is minimal and largely told rather than dramatized. His “balancedly curious” nature drives method‑building, yet we rarely see embodied stress or contradictory impulses under pressure. Skepticism from colleagues is mentioned but not staged into a choice with visible cost. The final acceptance reads earned conceptually, not emotionally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motive (assuring the living, honoring her grandmother) is clear and her agency drives the save. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; she pivots quickly from curiosity to certainty with minimal contradictory impulses. Her professionalism and tenderness with the child feel specific. The resolution shows an earned shift (from closure‑giver to protector) but the personal cost remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (standing by the unremembered, haunted by her brother) is clear and embodied in micro‑choices under time and claustrophobic pressure. The contradictory impulses—fear of enclosed spaces vs. compulsion to guide—register on the page. However, she encounters minimal resistance while executing the ritual, so struggle feels muted. A stronger on‑page cost or falter during one transition would deepen credibility and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear motivation and a credible internal contradiction (yearning for return vs acceptance of a digital in‑between) culminate in a believable stance shift. Micro‑choices (ink ritual, heartbeat counting, making coffee) express value hierarchy under gentle pressure. Embodiment is present but often generalized; the epiphany edges toward ease. A stronger felt cost or friction with the sleepers downstairs would deepen character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, singular motivation anchors the protagonist, and embodied details (copper veins, tracing birds, fingers on textured fabrics) give him specificity. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely faces a live dilemma on the page. The emotional palette leans serene and reverent, with little friction to complicate choice. The final tears land, but the arc reads more steadfast than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris’s motives (from derided academic to witness) are coherent and evolve, with the undercover role and the secret phone calls revealing specific values. However, most pressure is reflective rather than dramatized; few concrete micro-choices under strain test those values. The earned renunciation—document, don’t dissect—lands, but the visible cost is largely implied.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elayn’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority is largely declarative (“to reawaken beauty”) with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The heart‑rhythm tactic shows competence, yet struggle and doubt are minimal and quickly resolved. The visible cost is light (forbidden space, stirring guardians, the shell’s loss). The arc feels earned but emotionally undertextured for top‑tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s respectful defiance is embodied in concrete micro-choices (timed drop, neutral face, diversion via “pretend deliveries”) under pressure. Interiority is specific—adrenaline against practiced calm—and his motive (smuggling hope) aligns with action. The touch with the woman and his line to the guards reveal character under stress without speechifying. Slightly tidy morality and limited flaw complexity keep it just shy of great.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear interior drive (interpreting silence as possibility) and a credible conflict (fear vs. desire) culminate in the risk of breaking a 20‑year vow of silence. Micro‑choices—examining the fragment for hours, trusting the “wrong turn,” finally singing—track cleanly to motive. Emotions are embodied via craft habits and sensory attunement rather than labels. The cost is present but soft‑edged, leaning lyrical rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margaret’s desire and method are clear and consistent, and her tactile relation to the scarf and shelves gives embodied motive. However, internal conflict is minimal; she rarely doubts or risks a competing value, so the arc leans toward serene inevitability. The scarf’s dissolution provides a credible cost that reframes her endurance as earned. Micro‑choices (book arrangement, whispering equations/verses) reveal her worldview but not many live trade‑offs.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—recovering a “runaway dream” tied to her sister—and her actions align with that drive across beats. Interiority is credible and embodied (“Tears blurred her vision”), though internal contradiction is light; she rarely faces a fraught trade‑off beyond acceptance. Her professional frame (odd-hour librarian) and artist’s process color perception effectively. The final stance shift (from chasing to conversing) reads earned, if emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Silas’s goal is clear and consistently pursued, and his competence is convincingly staged through ritualized action. However, he meets little resistance and shows minimal internal contradiction; the work feels serene rather than pressured. The “improbable longing” for liberation gives him texture, but the absence of a meaningful misstep or hesitation caps the depth. The client’s presence is purely psychic, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to recover memories is clear and consistent, with tactile, character‑specific actions (charting stars, touching mushrooms) revealing her under pressure. The tremble/caution vs. determination offers a mild internal tension, though the struggle feels relatively unopposed. Her folklorist competence informs choices without sliding into exposition. The change to “whole again” reads earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s motive—quietly mentoring resilience while living with exile—is clear and embodied in choices (backward pacing, demonstrating rather than confessing). His “combative tenderness” appears in the correction “Not enter exactly,” balancing authority with doubt. Prisha’s micro‑arc (from trembling to steady under the door’s creak) credibly reflects his influence. Emotional cost is present but muted; interior contradiction could press harder under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks “to preserve the color of wonder”—and her actions align with this goal through the seed ritual. Interiority is embodied via tactile beats (thrum, tingling, threads of light). Internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little ambivalence or temptation, reducing depth. The cost (“give pieces of oneself”) is stated and felt but remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motive (to ground the spirits and ease Jacob’s burden) is clear and enacted through specific choices, especially deciding to unravel the net. Her “accumulated silence” and brokenness personalize the tactic and give her a distinct interior texture. However, internal contradiction under pressure is muted; she executes with near‑perfect competence and little struggle. Jacob functions more as a catalyst than an active counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular, and her methodical curiosity drives concrete actions (overlays, frame-by-frame study). Interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, though “trembling hands” gives one embodied beat. The final renunciation—repairing the map to honor the threshold—reads as an earned stance with a modest cost. The internal contradiction (discover vs. preserve) is present but largely articulated rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific—an analytic medium seeking the “physics of letting go.” Interiority feels embodied (tablet playback, tracing letters, tears) rather than labeled, and the shift from analysis to personal grief reads earned. The contradiction between methodical observation and vulnerable emotion lands. The cost is soft but present in the final acceptance and melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific (childhood silence → empathy), but most of her action is summarized rather than dramatized through pressured micro‑choices. Her “driftingly alert” perception enables her role; we rarely see contradictory impulses tested on the page. The relationship with the ghost functions but lacks on‑scene friction. The ending offers endurance and connection but little visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s motives—curiosity, service, and guarded affection—consistently drive her choices, culminating in the earned decision to protect the captain’s secret. The contradiction between professional detachment and personal tenderness is present in action (decoding, then re‑hiding the diary). Stakes are interior and quiet, which softens the felt cost slightly. Still, her “silent promise” reads as a credible renunciation with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motive and worldview are clear and particular, filtered through her profession and the telescope’s personal history. Her embodied calm under danger and focused note‑taking feel character‑specific. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she rarely struggles on the page between professional caution and belief. The final stance is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s face blindness convincingly shapes her perception and motives, and the pivot from literal stars to “constellations of human connection” reads earned. The interiority is concrete (touch, light, pattern) rather than diagnostic, though conflict remains mostly internal and low-friction. We don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond curiosity vs. clock, which keeps the arc contained. Still, actions align with motives and culminate in a credible renunciation of her original plan’s literalism.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation and a competent, attentive mind drive Eli, but interior conflict is minimal and the discovery arrives without genuine strain. Emotions skew told (“his heart racing”) rather than embodied in specific, pressured micro‑choices. The “sociable isolation” note adds texture but not a crucible. The final stance shifts from aspiration to achieved purpose, yet without a visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear (to learn the “rhythm of repair”) and actions align with it; embodied emotion appears in trembling fingers and breath-clouds. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the path feels largely frictionless, softening the felt cost of the final choice. The legacy tie to the grandfather adds specificity without generating real pressure. The earned realization (“not to claim something new, but to restore”) lands but reads a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elion’s altruism and Aris’s trust are clear, but interiority and embodied conflict are thin; we’re told they act rather than feeling them decide under pressure. Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” trait enables bridge‑work but never meets visible resistance or cost. Elion’s constraint (noncorporeality) is noted yet not dramatized at a peak beat. The final communal shift is earned causally but not character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is lucid and steady—Elias intends to “vouchsafe the new phase of time”—and his actions consistently serve it. Interiority is largely textural rather than conflicted; he rarely reveals contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied experience is present (bone‑deep thrumming, exhaustion), but the piece favors ritual over dilemma. The final endurance reads earned, though the cost is primarily fatigue and ongoing vigilance, not a trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive (promise-bound caretaker who chooses to risk himself to save strangers) is clear and consistent, and his competence under pressure reads credible. The internal shift from reluctant burden to chosen purpose lands, aided by the nut’s depletion as felt cost. However, interior conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in-the-moment; we rarely see contradictory impulses clash as he acts. Embodied emotion is present but often couched in repeated phrases (“graceless beauty”) instead of fresh, character-specific textures.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and grounded in her identity; the argument, the ravine walk, and the call to her sister align with her polymer/music lens. Interiority is specific (foam as polymer chains), with embodied perception rather than labels. The decisive apology is credible but a touch tidy, with limited on‑page friction or contradictory impulses at the peak. The cost (vulnerability, reorienting priorities) lands, though lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vendor’s motive (to find where stories begin) is clear and specific, and their micro‑choices (selecting shards, performing the opening ritual) align with parole constraints. Interiority is textured and character‑particular, with a credible contradiction between creative impulse and fear of harming completed tales. However, pressure on the self is relatively gentle, so the change lands more as a contemplative repricing than a hard, costly turn. The felt cost of the parole is present but not truly tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—refining remorse so it no longer wounds—is clear and consistently drives his actions. His fear of being subsumed adds credible internal pressure, and he modulates exposure (“just enough”) in a character‑specific way. However, we don’t see a concrete, personal regret confronted on the page, which slightly blunts the felt cost. The absence of another on‑page character limits relational crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s motive is clear and consistent, and her choices drive the action, but interior conflict and embodied cost are minimal. We rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure; most turns are summarized as successes. The “empathetically decisive” label is enacted, but without friction or sacrifice. The final beat reframes her as a bridge builder, yet the transition feels earned more by exposition than on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear motive and embodied stakes (trembling fingers, tears) give the engineer specificity, but contradictory impulses are faint; there’s little dramatized resistance beyond awe and tremor. Competence remains largely unchallenged, so struggle reads interior and smooth. The identity‑blur cost arrives, but we don’t see a hard choice negotiated on the page. Still, the particular “helix‑mind” filter offers a distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s desire and competence are clear, but interior conflict is minimal; she rarely doubts or falters. The repeated labels (“prism-minded,” “latent blaze”) substitute for more individualized texture. Her micro-choices (sequencing the thresholds, arranging the final elements) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening pressure on character. The modest cost—foregoing further exploration and accepting renewed responsibility—lands but feels conceptually more than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to restore music is clear, embodied in tactile choices (kneeling, tracing cracks, strumming) and culminates in renewed resolve. Interiority is specific (tears, tremors, remembered instruction) rather than generic. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; competence remains largely untested. The final stance (beginning the work anew) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, with tactile anchors (the worry stone, notebooks) revealing character under pressure. The internal arc from guilt to recognition reads earned if a touch tidy. Contradictory impulses are present but muted; he rarely feels truly torn, and stress signals are largely contemplative rather than conflicted. The final acceptance forecloses penance-as-payment for acknowledgment-as-partnership, though the felt cost remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—recover the diary via resonance to validate her empathy work—and her actions align with that aim. Interiority is filtered through her vibrational worldview with embodied touches (tears, breath, tactile handling), though contradictions are minimal. The shift from cataloging to teaching reads earned but carries limited on‑page cost. A slightly idealized steadiness blunts sharper conflict within her.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s ambition and sensory gift motivate clear choices (climbing higher, the moonlit vigil), and her shift from extraction to apprenticeship reads earned. Internal contradiction is light—she meets little resistance—so pressure rarely exposes competing impulses. Embodied perception through scent and doodling is character‑specific. The final stance (keeper/bridge) lands but with minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Arion’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interior conflict is minimal and the epiphany arrives largely from an external vision rather than contested choice. Competence dominates; we get little contradiction or cost under pressure. Embodied emotion appears (“brace,” dread/wonder), yet remains surface-level. The final shift reads earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s motives and methods are clear and consistent, and her professionalism filters perception in character‑specific ways. However, interiority leans on labeled traits (“rapidly adapting,” “hazy precision”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The talismanic patch adds a human inflection but does not provoke a difficult trade‑off. The closing stance (settling to continue) feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motive and role, but Eira encounters little resistance; her competence faces no on‑page test. Interiority leans abstract (“certify wonder”) over contradictory impulses in action. Embodied synesthesia is vivid, yet the emotional cost of the responsibility is asserted more than dramatized. The ending delivers fulfillment without visible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation (atonement through insight) drives embodied micro‑choices (selecting driftwood, seating within the spiral, breath control on the flute). Pride vs. humility is dramatized via visions rather than told only. The transformation reads earned, though the emotional resolution leans a touch tidy. Tears and the ritualized return of the driftwood register cost credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is crisp and consistent, and her micro‑choices (inviting Thomas, activating the transfer, dismissing him) align with her research drive. However, her interior conflict is muted; she rationalizes ethics rather than wrestling with them on the page. Thomas’s panic provides contrast but remains secondary. The cost is conceptual and relational rather than felt by Elara in body or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear motivation (deliver the pendant before solstice) and a modest internal shift (from jittery to confident) land credibly. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; few moments of real ambivalence under pressure. The key renunciation—giving up the pendant—reads earned but lightly contested. Secondary characters apply minimal pressure, limiting character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to validate a hard-won, controversial theory) is clear and drives each action. The grounded skeptic vs. mystic tension is dramatized in tactile beats—pressing the prism to glass, closing her eyes despite demanding proof. Her internal shift from “emotions” to “preserved moments” reads earned by the experience. The cost is more conceptual than felt, which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear (grandmother’s charge; the bead’s summons) and her choices—leaving, sacrificing memories, activating the bamboo—align with it. However, interiority remains largely summarized and archetypal, with limited embodied contradiction or micro‑hesitation under pressure. The sacrifice of her grandmother’s laughter is the strongest, most felt character moment. More textured, conflicting impulses at the sacrifice beats would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation and arc are clear—meekness to purpose—and the hesitation at the trade offers a credible micro‑conflict. After the bargain, however, struggle is largely summarized; we don’t witness meaningful mistakes or contradictory impulses under pressure. The cost of “silence, time, and essence” is asserted but not dramatized in a way that complicates later choices. Competence dominates, softening character testing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, specific drive (to uncover a withheld truth) and a distinct professional lens (“sensory map maker”) ground the POV. Interiority is embodied in tactile engagements with the shard and space, though contradictory impulses (risk vs. restraint) are only lightly dramatized. Agency surfaces in attempts to grasp the red shard and the door, but many transitions are summarized rather than pressured in-scene. The final Earned Stasis—accepting delay with renewed resolve—feels motivated but could carry sharper on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s reticence and observational acuity feel specific and embodied, and his choices (repairing the light, honoring the chain, returning the sea glass) align with that character. The internal conflict is quiet—loneliness versus duty—and resolves credibly through a chosen commitment. The cost is emotional rather than dramatic, but it reads: he accepts responsibility for preserving a secret lineage. A slightly sharper moment of hesitation under pressure would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive—guiding humanity with “ancient shadows”—is coherent and consistent, and her ritualized labor grounds her competence. The internal countercurrent (elation vs. fear of misguiding others) surfaces, but it rarely pressures a concrete choice on the page. Her prophetic slip creates worry but doesn’t force a sacrifice or visible mistake. Still, micro-choices (aligning mirrors, declaring the hidden channel) reveal her values under soft pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motive—uncovering why some people “magnetize stories”—is clear and consistently drives his ritual and experimentation. Interiority is particular (the donor heart altering color perception) but internal contradiction is minimal; pressure is gentle rather than testing. His shift to “iridescent caution” reads as an earned stance, though the felt cost is soft. The donor heart adds texture to identity but doesn’t force a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Samuel’s motive—maintain the labyrinth and access arboreal consciousness—is clear and particular, with tactile labor (raw hands, rerouted pipes) grounding him. Interiority is specific (ledgered “quantified sorrow,” resonance notes), but internal contradiction is mild; the epiphany arrives with little resistance. His key micro‑choice—aligning the broken sextant to the moonbeam on the oak board—reveals character but faces limited on‑page cost. The closing reorientation of purpose feels earned but comfortable rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and steady—rekindle the realm through memory and song—and actions align. Interiority leans abstract and ceremonial rather than embodied or contradictory, with few live frictions on the page. The “bound yet released” endpoint is earned but the cost of using their own memories remains mostly conceptual. A stronger on‑page dilemma or visible depletion would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleanor’s contradictory impulses—compassion versus self‑protection—are clearly dramatized, especially in her “staying while leaving” tactic and the note she writes at midnight. Interiority is coherent and consistent with her role as midnight curator. However, much is told in abstractions (“nested paradoxes,” “enlarged tranquility”) rather than embodied under pressure. The cost of her refusal is felt but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliza’s motive—seeking the sacred in ordinary disappearances—is consistent and compels her to the tea house to confront what she found. Interiority is specific (bread as forgiveness, garden as care) and culminates in a credible shift: reading the letter and accepting absolution. Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. care, secrecy vs. revelation) are present but subtle. Minor label-forward phrasing trims depth (“heuristically gentle”) without derailing motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s duty, precision, and hope are clear and consistent, and his actions align with his meticulous temperament. However, interior conflict is minimal; he rarely wrestles with contradictory impulses on the page. The felt cost is mostly implied (endurance, painstaking work) rather than dramatized. Still, his micro-choices at the workstation reveal character through method and care.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eliza’s motive—capturing the “sound of trust breaking”—is clear and governs her tactics, with competent, targeted micro‑choices (false start, seeding suspicion, final lie). Interiority is adequate but not deeply conflicted; she feels “comforting unease” yet encounters little internal contradiction under pressure. Secondary figures function as pressure sources rather than characters, leaving status dynamics fairly one‑note. The earned endurance at the end is credible but low‑cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, embodied motivation (researcher drawn to the convergence) with a live internal tension between skepticism and sensory evidence. The final acceptance is earned via cumulative signals (ring activation, aurora “tallies,” the storm man’s arrival) but the surrender comes a touch easily with little friction at the last beat. The relationship pressure with the storm carrier is evocative but brief, limiting status dynamics. Still, micro‑choices (moving closer, reading taste shifts, taking his hand) reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear—Rhodes returns to reclaim his art and rectify the portrait of Cora—and his actions align with that drive. Interiority is vivid but often summarized in abstractions (“blessing and curse,” “uncork suppressed creativity”) rather than dramatized contradiction in the moment. The grief/regret cost is felt but not tested through resistance; he encounters little on‑page friction. The final renunciation of external validation reads earned, though somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are vivid and consistent—truth as sustenance and liability—and the “wilting near dishonesty” trait personalizes her costs. Her interiority is specific (leaf‑gilding, spoken truths curing) and her decision to depart at dawn earns a credible renunciation. Internal contradiction (need for connection vs. intolerance for false peace) is present, though some realizations verge on tidy declaration. A bit more embodied struggle in the final choice would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s devotion and seasonal muteness motivate her choices clearly, but interior contradiction and on‑page micro‑choices are mostly summarized rather than dramatized. The piece reads hagiographic—competence and purpose with little visible struggle—so cost feels conceptual more than embodied. Her final ascent and lifelong endurance register, yet without a crucible relationship or acute dilemma the character remains emblematic over particular.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Unit 734’s caretaker drive and inner static are clear and consistent, with concrete micro-choices (opening the box, initiating protocol 34, redirecting life support) that align with motive. The contradiction—mechanical nature versus organic responses—animates the decision to fragment. Emotional texture leans abstract at times, but nostalgia via the children and the box grounds it. The sacrifice of the original form reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo’s motive—curate, listen, and reconnect—reads clear and consistent, and his choices (displaying the locket, pursuing leads, opening the mailbox, relinquishing ownership) align. Interiority is mostly summarized rather than embodied; we rarely feel contradictory impulses under pressure. The convenient arrival of Mrs. Henderson’s key reduces the need for struggle. The final renunciation (the locket belongs to “everyone”) lands but with limited on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motive and competence are clear, but her internal conflict is minimal and she faces little genuine pressure; she reads as frictionless mastery. The choice to dance the sequence is consistent yet costless. Interiority leans into statements rather than contradictory impulses under stress. Lydia’s arrival adds little crucible pressure to test Elara’s values.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive—recovering her brother’s erased memories—drives every choice, and her embodied rituals (lanterns, coffee, digging) reveal a specific psyche. Internal contradiction is modest: she hesitates little beyond trembling hands and a brief resistance in the sand, so struggle reads light. The renunciation—accepting visitation over extraction—lands credibly but with limited cost on the page. A touch more friction or self-doubt under pressure would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and steady—he aims to hush the coded prophecy—and his actions align with that goal through concrete micro‑choices (mapping silence, positioning the wing, final release). However, interior contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or faces a destabilizing impulse, which flattens pressure. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, breath aligned with water) but remains uniformly serene-competent. The earned change is credible yet costs him little beyond effort and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clara’s desire to decode buildings is clear and consistently pursued, and the mentor–student dynamic with Mr. Abernathy is warm and specific. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are light; she meets little resistance as she advances. The emotional reveal of kinship lands but avoids harder edges or flaws that would complicate choice. The final handoff of the seal reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear (to confront and archive quarantined memories) and rooted in a credible contradiction—“charmed skeptic” warring with undeniable phenomena. Micro-choices (arranging crystals, humming to bridge realms, accepting the keeper role) reveal values under pressure. Emotional embodiment leans abstract at times (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve”) but still reads character-specific. The final acceptance carries cost—the burden of containment—though it’s felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—atonement for “calibrated treason” drives every move. Interiority is specific enough in how the key and thorn refract guilt, though the conflict resolves a bit cleanly with limited on‑page resistance. The blood‑signature is an embodied, character‑specific choice that fits his craft. The final renunciation (leaving the sanctuary) feels earned if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The echo singer’s purpose and inner drive are clear and consistent, and her pivot from curiosity to compassion reads as an earned shift. However, interiority leans summary-lyric over embodied stress; we rarely feel competing impulses in motion beyond generalized “duty vs curiosity.” The key micro-choices (following, kneeling, singing, offering choice) align with motive but carry low on‑page friction. Emotional cost is implied (relinquishing her defining question), not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent (to “salvage something pure”), and her choice to reveal truth gently rather than accuse shows a credible value hierarchy. However, interiority is mostly summarized rather than embodied under pressure, with few on‑page micro‑choices. The trait “weaves truth carefully” manifests in her tactic (dream visitations), which is strong. Still, the emotional cost on her is lightly sketched rather than lived in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent interiority and motive (to honor hidden effort) are rendered through tactile routines, but internal conflict is minimal and risk‑light. His choices (whistling, following moon paths, returning to tea) align, yet lack contradictory impulses under pressure. The villagers’ judgment hints at cost but isn’t dramatized in-scene. The final acceptance of imperfection reads earned but serene rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—her debunker ethos drives the investigation and the closing decision—but internal contradiction (skeptic vs. believer/keeper) is stated more than dramatized. We get some embodied detail (raw fingers, warmth from the diamond) yet few pressured micro‑choices on the page. The pivot from debunking to guardianship lands but lacks a felt price beyond asserted danger. Emotional texture tends toward declarative resolution rather than conflicted simultaneity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—allegiance to frequencies and the aim to “shape a new dawn”—is clear and consistent, and his renunciation of leadership for translation reads as an earned stance. Interiority is particular (ozone-stained fingertips, patient decoding), but contradictory impulses are muted; he faces little on‑page pressure that forces a fraught micro‑choice. His endurance carries cost (isolation, marginalization), though it’s largely narrated rather than dramatized in a live crucible. Secondary characters (acolytes, the surface prophet) function offstage, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s motive—to bridge generations through captured sound—is clear and consistent, and his choice to bring the music to the senior center aligns with it. Interiority is textured (jars of preserved sounds, the “translator” belief), though internal contradiction and visible cost are light. He makes purposeful micro-choices (infusing intention, opening jar and box) but faces little resistance. Overall, credible and engaging, if not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear (protect the artifact) and actions align, but the internal struggle is mostly summarized (“panic warred with...logic”) rather than dramatized through pressured micro‑choices. The “logically emotional” trait is told more than shown, though cracks of embodiment appear in tactile cues (key’s weight/warmth, bone‑deep vibration). Competence borders on frictionless; success arrives without visible mistake or recalibration. The final vow suggests endurance with cost, but that cost is largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (to launch a “patient revolution”), but interiority remains largely abstract with minimal embodied conflict. The mapper’s key choices—waiting for the zenith, charting resonance, deciding to share with elders—are calm rather than pressured. Contradictory impulses (vigilante vs. patient) are gestured at but not dramatized in a moment of strain. The ending’s stance is earned but low‑cost, reading more as resolve than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s professional rigor and personal lineage converge into a credible, propulsive motive; her calm exterior vs. stirred ancestry gives her a lived contradiction. Micro‑choices (noticing scratches, opening the lantern, documenting inconsistencies) reveal values under pressure. The final stance—risking career to honor truth—feels earned by prior beats. Occasional abstract labels (“controlling influence”) blunt texture slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Father Michael’s motives (seeking repair vs. honoring the heart’s silence as penance and spur to action) are clear and steady, with credible internal tension between thrift, duty, and guilt. His micro-choices (coming for a second opinion, slowing his approach, deciding not to fix) feel consistent with a careful, world-worn chaplain. The bought-house reveal deepens character without breaking plausibility. Minor on-the-nose lines reduce the sense of layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—its “yearning algorithm” and curiosity drive each move. Interiority is present but mostly labeled via repeated terms rather than contradictory impulses. The glider makes micro-choices (taking the arrow tip, choosing the kaleidoscope, striking the bell) that align with motive. Cost and internal conflict remain muted, keeping the arc modest.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive (find where deleted files go) is clear, consistent, and scales to a risky breach. We get specific interior texture—her pattern sensitivity, the “archive doesn’t lie” credo, and the visceral thrill/fear during the 90‑second window. Internal contradiction is present but light (duty vs. transgression); she largely reads as hyper‑competent. The final renunciation—disappearing underground—carries a credible cost and aligns with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena’s motivation (save the settlement and prove empathy-as-action) is clear and drives her ritual. Interiority is present but largely confident and declarative, with little simultaneous contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (gloves on, tracing unseen patterns, choosing the mirrors) reveal character but avoid genuine risk or self-doubt. The ending registers a change in status but with minimal visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motive—arriving as a euthanasia tourist to “learn the sound of approaching endings”—is clear and coherently tracked to the renunciation at the end. Her interiority is grounded in tactile anchors (ice, wind, the parasol tip) and a live contradiction (seeking death vs. finding solace). Marcus provides gentle relational pressure that refracts her thinking without hijacking agency. A few abstracted lines (“transformation—a becoming”) soften the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear interior motive (rediscover meaning; nurture understanding) with credible contradictions (his gentle persuasion as both virtue and barrier). Embodied touches (burned letter edge, autumn chill) ground emotion. However, there are few on‑page micro‑choices under present pressure; most turns are reflective. The change reads as a reframing rather than a costly decision, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear (preserve wisdom’s echo) and consistent, and the admission of isolation gives a felt cost. However, interior conflict remains largely declared rather than dramatized, with few micro‑choices under pressure beyond proceeding with the ritual. The “strangely honest” trait informs stance but rarely constrains action. Emotional texture is steady, not truly contradictory in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive (facilitating collective healing through the arc photographs) is clear and consistent, and her calm, ritualized actions align with it. However, interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are minimal; she faces little resistance or cost. The group’s presence doesn’t force a personal trade-off or reveal a flaw. The resulting change reads as steady fulfillment more than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—his duty to language and isolation as a corrosive force—but internal contradiction is modest (reverence vs. urgency rather than a true clash of impulses). Embodied moments (dust motes, trembling hands, pressing the crystal to his ear) reveal him under pressure. The shift from preservation to translation lands as an earned stance crystallization. However, much interior movement is declared rather than contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—the quest to hear “the sound of growing older”—and the internal contradiction (clinging vs. precognitive forgetting) surfaces at the arch. Interiority is embodied through tactile actions (driftwood, chalk) rather than labels. The caretaker adds light relational pressure without distracting from the core drive. The final renunciation/endurance—accepting memory’s slip—reads earned though not devastatingly costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—transcending perception and saving the observatory—drives concrete choices (ignoring force for resonance, taking the clock outside). Interiority is specific to her craft and temperament. The internal contradiction (duty to stabilization vs. intuitive attunement) is present but lightly pressured. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized risk.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    The therapist’s motives (execute a flawless goodbye) are clear and embodied in concrete micro‑choices (arranging chairs, placing the vinyl, modulating volume). Interiority is steady and credible, if a touch generalized in a few lines of credo. Secondary characters register briefly yet meaningfully—Mrs. Anders’ memory and the son’s denial sharpen the crucible. The arc leans endurance over contradiction; little internal friction, but the cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her choices (closing loops, turning the key) align with her scholar’s temperament. Interiority is serviceable but thin—she faces little contradictory impulse beyond urgency vs. deliberation. The transformation to “ready to follow the shadows” is believable but comes with minimal felt cost. Embodied emotion appears in tactile beats (warm key, trembling isle) but seldom complicates her certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s “forgiving skeptic” stance is coherent and motivating, propelling her to attempt an ethically ambiguous ritual. Her interior contradiction (proof-seeking vs. wonder) is dramatized in the bone‑setting motions “on the air.” The felt cost—relinquishing certainty for renewal—is present if subtle. A slightly smoother rendering of embodied stress under peak beats could raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—share the stars without fire despite a condition anchoring her to Earth—is clear and consistent, and her hands-on choices (collecting, weighing, polishing, arranging) align. The internal tug between wistfulness and determination gives credible tension, though contradictions rarely peak into a pressured dilemma. The cost—accepting she won’t travel to space—reads, but it’s largely pre-accepted rather than newly paid on the page. Still, the endurance/renunciation lands as an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, consistent motivation (seeking reconciliation after exposing misconduct) drives specific choices, notably the decision to leave the heirloom pendant. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular in the tech‑ruin/moss lens. A few therapy‑speak abstractions (“stages of grief,” “protected vulnerability,” “catalyst for change”) soften the messiness of contradiction at peak beats. The renunciation reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (artistic integrity vs market pressure) and an internal contradiction that resolves through a ritual act. Micro-choices—returning at dawn, placing the shell, reading aloud—align with his values. Some interiority leans abstract and generalized (“human resilience and connection”), softening embodied emotion. Still, the renunciation/peace feels earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions track cleanly from vision to community restoration. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she encounters little doubt or friction that forces a revealing trade‑off. Embodied emotion appears (the “ache,” the feverish work), but the arc leans idealized. The final acceptance of cyclical duty hints at cost but doesn’t materially test her limits on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is explicit (translate heartbeats into maps; safekeep starlight), and actions align, but interior contradiction is thin. We get patience and reverence, yet little embodied conflict beyond “one misstep” risk. Micro‑choices (arranging leaves, timing the seal) register but don’t reveal layered value trade‑offs. The ending doesn’t force a renunciation or visible price beyond concentration.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—restoring communal memory—drives steady, competent choices, and her locksmith lens grounds the method. Interiority is particular (peripheral vision, mapping light), though internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers or pays an on‑page personal price beyond time and focus. Actions align with traits and escalate plausibly from observation to calibration to reactivation. The endurance/renunciation cost is subtle rather than felt as sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The weaver’s interiority is specific and embodied (lamp warmth, whalebone ledger, careful orientation), and the ritual exposes a credible contradiction: duty versus isolation. The micro‑choice to calcify their own burden underlines cost and care. The final reframe (“gift rather than a curse”) is earned, though the repeated label “boundary‑lessly trapped” reads slightly declarative. Strong, character‑filtered action with a modest hint of told theme.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clara’s motives and contradictions are clear: she’s “hauntingly practical” yet living with ghosts, channeling grief into carving under a self‑imposed clock. Embodied actions (testing the grain, first tentative cut, stopping with a serene lion) reveal her. The endurance at the end (choosing to keep making, “holding differently”) feels earned. Slight limitation: the pressure never forces a sharper micro‑tradeoff beyond attention and patience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cyrus’s motive—repairing his life by negotiating with his ghost—is clear and consistent, and his actions (fitting the wheel, stepping onto the word‑bridge, offering the wheel) align under pressure. Interiority is vivid (regret, time‑torn perception) though contradictory impulses are lightly sketched rather than dramatized in conflict. The ghostly counterpart provides a relational crucible at the peak but with minimal verbal interplay. The cost is legible in surrendering the wheel and accepting a reconfigured self.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s drive—curiosity aligned with a civil engineer’s pragmatism—clearly motivates each action, and her agency powers the plot. Interiority is particular enough (tactile engagement with consoles, methodical rerouting) though conflict is light and largely unopposed. The “stoic wonder” texture is consistent, but contradictory impulses or visible blind spots are minimal. The closing realization feels earned but carries limited cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—making peace with an abandoned dream—is clear and continuously embodied (steady hands vs trembling heart). Micro‑choices (rising early, tracing the crystal, offering the soldered‑shut watch) align with his interiority. The contradiction of precision and fear sustains tension and makes the final recommitment credible. Change is earned and forecloses the self‑protective stasis he’s lived in.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire and doubt (“she often wondered if she was truly equipped”) give her dimension, and her retrieval/decision beats align with motive. Interiority is concrete in places (wood groaning, dust motes) but the epiphany leans abstract. Contradictory impulses are present but mild; pressure never forces a hard trade‑off. The closing commitment carries cost implicitly, not viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motive (seeking the weavers) and a patient temperament drive choices; his measured compliment and the reveal of the fulgurite are tactically aligned with character. Interiority is present but thin on contradiction—he rarely struggles or risks beyond waiting in the cold. The relationship dynamic is legible and evolves credibly from guardedness to trust. A deeper felt cost or a sharper internal conflict would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, particular interiority with credible contradiction: his “projection of presence” is both gift and defense. Micro‑choices (unfolding the thread, turning from the gardener to himself) align with motive and reveal cost. Occasional abstract phrasing (“geography of healing”) distances feeling slightly. The earned turn to writing his own obituary lands as a believable, costly shift.

    Elorian’s drive is clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (assembling, activating, accepting failure, resolving to dismantle). The internal contradiction—reviving beauty via the very mechanism that killed it—lands credibly at the end. Some interiority leans abstract (“hypothesized about everything”), reducing felt specificity. Still, the emotional pivot from hope to hard resolve reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s paradox (arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter) anchors motive and yields credible micro‑choices, especially her move toward the garden after the evacuation order. Interiority is concrete through the coin, black sand, and grafts rather than therapy‑speak. The internal conflict leans tidy as the mantra “Scars can sing” recurs without much resistance. Still, her embodied care under pressure reads specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives and inner texture are clear—skepticism vs. hope, discipline vs. urgency—and her micro‑choices (kneeling to summon “sidereal patience,” choosing imagination over force) align with those traits. However, the path offers little resistance, so contradictory impulses don’t truly collide on the page; competence carries her through. The “Keeper” inheritance hints at cost (identity shift), but the transition is swift and relatively painless. Net: credible, specific, but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clear, consistent motive (“to share light without using fire”) and a steady internal stance, but few embodied micro-choices or contradictory impulses under pressure. The being largely executes a plan without visible struggle or cost beyond reflective yearning. Emotional texture leans abstract, with limited sensory embodiment of feeling. The brief hesitation implied by the gear slowing is promising but underdeveloped as a genuine crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives and craft-centered worldview are clear and embodied through tactile choices (thumb to stone, knots as stanzas). His grief history with the grandmother grounds the vocation, and his decision to retrace the mentor’s path gives him agency. Internal contradiction (empty and overflowing) is present but lightly dramatized; pressure rarely forces a hard trade-off. The visible cost at the end (ribbon depleted, mentor’s work complete) lands as credible endurance rather than a fraught change.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alaric’s ethic of precision and his blind spot toward community are clear and consistent, and his public admission “I need helpers!” is a credible, motive-driven turn. Interiority is concrete at times (hands on the rake handle, heat through wood), but the emotional struggle resolves a bit tidily. The embodied cost is social vulnerability rather than physical, which lands but could be more contested. Some lines risk platitude, softening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—decoding the tapestry to learn buried intentions—is consistent and expressed through tactile choices (separating threads, returning the tapestry, resetting the clock). The internal turn from romantic expectation to sacrificial truth lands, but his “blithe” steadiness dampens friction and limits felt cost. Interiority is concrete (the hum, the melody, tender handling) yet light on contradiction. The closing choice to keep the secret is credible but not deeply agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is crystalline (protect the villagers by mapping the future), and competence reads consistent with her role. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she doesn’t wrestle on the page with doubt versus duty beyond a stated resolve to “prevail over skepticism.” Emotions skew told rather than embodied, with limited sensory stress in the body. The final act (completing the map) is earned but pays little visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—she risks herself so stories can flow, and the dust-tech discovery personalizes her mission. Interiority is steady but low-contradiction; we don’t see a live push-pull under pressure in the broadcast moment. Micro-choices (tuning, lyric crafting, packing) align with motive but aren’t tested by an on‑page counterforce. The earned endurance at the end reads credible, if quiet, with cost implied rather than felt in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motivation—making permanence from the ephemeral and pursuing the “mirage of safety”—is clear and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (powdering, assembling, placing the mask). Interiority is specific to her craft, integrating ash, porcelain, and gallery politics. The internal contradiction (craving safety vs. accepting becoming) registers, though the beats remain mostly contemplative rather than pressured. A faint tendency toward thematic declaration undercuts raw, embodied tension at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Milo’s motives (preserve knowledge against dogma) are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—pocketing the cog, recommitting to preservation—align with his “abrasive calm.” The internal conflict (respect for mystery vs. admiration of engineering) is present but largely told rather than dramatized under pressure. Embodied emotion is light; we get tactile details (thumb over teeth) but few physical costs. The final endurance choice reads earned though the felt price stays conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eleanor’s motive—preserving vanishing arts by forging harmony—is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction and micro‑choices under pressure are largely summarized rather than dramatized. She reads steady, almost saintly, with few moments of simultaneous opposing impulses. The baton‑passing is meaningful yet arrives without on‑page struggle in the moment. The emotional arc from “expectantly resigned” to hope is told more than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—planting a seed as a gentle rebellion against industrial food—is clear and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (pruning, planting) aligned to that aim. The burden/gift of tasting memories adds specificity and a modest internal tension. However, his inner conflict remains light; he rarely wavers or risks much beyond what’s asserted. The cost (trimmed habits/relationships) is noted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s involuntary honesty credibly constrains her choices and creates friction, and her decision to hand over the master keycard underlines her values at a cost. Interiority is present but often told rather than embodied; the Bureau pair and supervisor are sketched more as functions than textured people. The “Not sabotage—despair” pivot gives her a distinctive moral stance. Emotional contradiction could be sharper under pressure, especially during the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s motive—diagnosing why some houses feel alive—drives concrete ritual choices and culminates in an earned realization. Interiority is specific (streetlights “daydream,” “shard of hush”) but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or pays an emotional price beyond wonder. The lighthouse placement beat reveals character through action. The change is credible but gentle, with limited cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    The diver’s internal conflict—academic certainty versus unsettling truth—is clear and results in a credible shift when they choose to open the ampoule. The statue’s incisive kindness reads as motive-driven action (guiding rather than dictating). However, the diver remains somewhat generic, with limited embodied specificity under pressure. The cost—relinquishing certainty—is felt but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive (escape and reclaim a missed bet) is clear and consistent with his “balancedly daring” temperament and mathematician’s mindset. Interiority is concrete via the dice and proofs, with a credible shift from grim optimism to decisive action. Some telling lines (“Fate mocks me,” reiterated labels) and tidy self-awareness slightly flatten complexity. The final choice is motivated and earned with an implied cost (years in purgatory) though the cost isn’t deeply felt at the moment of rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she paints through insomnia to recover a universal language of kindness—and actions align with this. Interiority is textured (moon-brush, jasmine, journals) but largely unconflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure beyond tremor and fatigue. The micro‑choices (preparing ink, selecting canvas, working through the night) are credible but low‑stakes. The endurance at the end reads as a modest, earned stasis rather than a turn with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guide’s historically driven ache and Khira’s stubborn craft are clear, embodied through specific acts (bringing the lens; kneading the ‘K’). Interiority is textured—hope versus “rosewater dread”—without therapy-speak. The relationship functions under pressure with distinct status and purpose. The visible cost is mostly endurance and grief rather than a sharp trade-off, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Esme’s goal and methods are clear, and her competence under pressure tracks cleanly to the final act. Interiority is present but leans abstract (“time was not a river... but a choice”), muting contradictory impulses. Physical choices (kneeling in cold water, twisting against the natural spin) align with motive and reveal character. The lack of a visible personal cost at the end limits depth of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (confront and outwit fear after resuscitation) and an internal contradiction (repulsion/attraction to the luminance and mirrors) give the POV texture. Micro‑choices—approaching the curtain, reading the paradoxes, touching the clasp—track with escalating commitment. The advisor’s reveal as a future self credibly recontextualizes the psyche’s split. Epiphany borders on tidy, with some platitudinal formulations softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear—she protects and guides by translating clouds into sound—but interior conflict is minimal, with little contradiction under pressure. Actions align with traits (choosing mallet over shouts), yet the emotional cost remains largely inferred. We don’t see micro‑choices that reveal value trade‑offs beyond method. Competent, not yet cutting into deeper ambivalence or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s drive is clear and consistent, and his agency (the whistle sequence, the descent, the renunciation) aligns with his motives. Interiority skews summary over contradiction—“sunwashed dread” and “people called him obsessed” gesture broadly rather than revealing lived, conflicted impulses. The key change—accepting guardianship over escape—reads earned by the discovery. A more embodied, pressured moment of doubt on the ladder down or upon reading the journal would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s motive is clear and steady, and her methodical choices (waiting for the rose’s last petal, photographing, prying up floorboards) align with an “emotionally rational” bent. Interiority is mostly summary-level rather than embodied, with little contradictory impulse on the page. Still, agency is consistent and purposeful. The final decision to collect the evidence credibly crowns her throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The surveyor’s motive—documenting “interlaced absence” and preserving memories—coheres with his choices (diving, annotating, sealing a note). His “stoically sensitive” contradiction surfaces in tactile beats (inkwell, cold water), but internal friction is modest and mostly stated rather than dramatized. The felt cost appears as the inkwell’s “heavier than usual” burden, not a hard trade‑off. Strong presence, slightly under-pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent from the outset (trace honest origins), and his methodological pivot under blackout pressure reads as a credible micro‑choice. The internal shift—recasting his lineage—is earned by the discovery of matching seals and subsequent confirmations. However, interior conflict is relatively smooth; he feels little friction or competing impulses beyond mild “troubling” coincidence. Repeated labels (“tranquilly perceptive,” “dappled resolve”) flatten some character‑particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular—turning grief into cranes and a final lantern—and actions align. Interiority is embodied (polishing gems, tears, the basket of cranes) with credible contradiction (release and grounding coexisting). The “shadow detaching” provides distinctive psychic texture rather than label-speak. Slight safety in the smooth acceptance at the end keeps it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear motive (grief repurposed into harvesting “unused potential”) drives action, but internal contradiction is thin—“nothing left to lose” flattens pressure and forecloses richer ambivalence. Embodied emotion lands in a few specifics (ozone, decay, vibrating resonance) yet leans on repeated abstractions (“bleak exhilaration,” “intangibly tangible”). The identity as a drone strike wedding survivor informs stakes but doesn’t create on‑page conflict with his choices. The closing self‑redefinition feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s goal and competence are clear, and her micro‑choices at the controls track cleanly with rising pressure. The “perpetually surprised” trait reads mostly as a label, but her concentration and embodied reactions (the jump at the alert, the breath before the pull) give texture. The final recognition that she herself is the missing piece is earned by the preceding actions, though the internal contradiction could be sharper. Emotional cost is light but coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Martin’s guilt, profession, and bodily stressors are concrete and consistent, and his micro‑choices (returning to the shore, handling the watch hand, distinguishing his own carvings) align with his motives. The discovery of the grandfather’s carving credibly reconfigures his self‑story and prompts a costly decision to close his business. Internal contradiction (profiting from erasure while yearning for truth) runs through the scene. The epiphany leans tidy but is earned by specific evidence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s motives and professional temperament are clear and guide her choices (stillness, timing, offering the drawer pull). Internal contradiction is limited—she remains composed rather than conflicted—so the emotional cost feels conceptual more than embodied. Rennett’s shift (rigid tension → acceptance) reads, though his interiority is mostly inferred. The final “I forgive” is earned but tidy, with little messy residue.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interiority is coherent and specific—her fall from professional esteem and improvised “utility pole” method reveal character under pressure. The final reconfiguration from “broken navigator” to “student of the sea” is earned by the scene’s accumulative beats. However, the epiphany edges tidy and declarative (“align heart and action,” “true north”), blunting contradiction and cost. More friction in the moment of shift would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motive (to kindle empathy) and a grounded POV with tactile reactions to the ball and cavern anchor the character. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are thin—choosing the tunnel and signing the ball happen with little hesitation or visible cost. The “dirty past” remains abstract, limiting lived stakes. The encounter with the younger self is intriguing but not fully mined for friction or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and urgent—reforge a bond beyond death—and the internal contradiction (fear of losing humanity vs. need to reconnect) is embodied in the metamorphosis. Micro-choices (mixing spices, calling the name, enduring the partial contact) track with pressure. A few lines drift toward platitude (“Pain changes us”), but the embodied details (roots, constellation eyes) keep her particular. The final acceptance is earned and comes with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (postpartum dislocation driving the quest) and a credible renunciation at closure; the ritual choices (tracing, unfastening, finishing the rite) align with her traits. Interiority is specific enough (awe/dread; the saucer as childhood remnant) but leans toward abstract labels (“choking beauty”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The cost—relinquishing control—lands, though the struggle feels gently resolved. A fuller embodiment of simultaneous impulses in the peak beat would raise it.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—Eli’s pacifism and long preparation credibly drive the choice to stitch the rift—but interior conflict is limited, with few contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion appears (levitation tied to joy; tears while stitching), yet much affect is stated in abstractions. The risk of a wrong stitch adds pressure but doesn’t materially degrade their composure, keeping struggle relatively smooth. The final renunciation (leaving the material world) reads earned but lightly costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ian’s motive—abandoning wealth to study transformation—is clear and consistent, and his final choice to release the bugs and gift the rest shows a credible, costly shift. However, interiority leans abstract (“texture of transformation”) and sometimes tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The meeting with the girl adds relational pressure but remains gentle. Strong, if a bit over-declared at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motive (transmit coordinates under blackout) is clear and consistent, and his competence reads. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are faint; he never risks a visible cost or frays emotionally despite surveillance danger. The interaction with the secondary guard hints at subtext but doesn’t force a hard trade‑off. The final endurance is credible but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific (the mentor’s vow and the curse), and her micro-choices (placing stones, persisting as the dust escalates) align. Interiority is mostly conveyed through image rather than complex contradiction; doubt/fear are present but lightly rendered. The shift from “control” to “respect/harmonize” reads earned by the events. Cost is conceptual (living with the curse), not strongly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maia’s motive—finding a voice under censorship—reads cleanly and drives each micro‑choice (ascending, setting the timer, extracting the map, writing). Interiority is textured through concrete objects (telescope, envelope, map) rather than labels alone. Internal contradiction (furious fire vs tranquil mask) is present, though the cost of breaking the mask remains mostly implied. The final stance—resolved purpose—feels earned by prior beats, if a touch safe in terms of on‑page risk.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris’s motives and competence are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (aligning the card, offering the demo) track with his ethos. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he meets little resistance, so his emotional progression stays flat. The student’s presence adds a light status dynamic but exerts little pressure. The closing “symbolizes” line leans explanatory rather than revealing a cost-laden change.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular interiority—his self‑molting and memory erosion create a credible, felt cost that informs every choice. Actions (scattering seeds, rebuilding shelves, sealing the tin) align with a mission rooted in the Elias bond. Internal contradiction (fragmented selves vs. unwavering purpose) reads, though pressure remains mostly atmospheric rather than forcing a hard dilemma. A touch more on‑page jeopardy or a sacrifice choice would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—grief for the daughter and a refusal to accept shutdown as finality drive the night’s gambit. Interiority comes mostly through action (the lullaby variations, the careful packing of the clock) rather than abstract labels, which helps. Internal contradiction (“ordinarily… he would have accepted this fate” vs. tonight’s defiance) is present but not deeply dramatized in-scene. Emotional cost is implied more than embodied at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserving fading collective memory before the monsoon—drives coherent choices from trek to song. Interiority is particular (the seed’s warmth, the lullaby half‑known) and doubt edges the climax, though contradiction never truly threatens her resolve. Actions align with the established “reality checker” identity and pay off through the ritual. A clearer on‑page cost or sharper internal friction would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—his ritual pursuit of “the color of unspoken apologies”—and actions align with that drive. The bonsai craft, patience versus urgency, and the confession about his brother and “her” reveal credible contradiction. Embodied choices (opening the case, arranging trees, touching branches) under pressure expose character. A slight neatness to the final revelation skirts sentimentality and the odd “RBG hands” glitch momentarily jars credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena’s motivation is clear but her transformation is more summarized than dramatized. The interiority feels overly articulate and diagnostic, as when she thinks of her "kindled humility" or her goal "to strip needless drama," which abstracts her internal state rather than embodying it in a moment of genuine contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority trends toward the abstract and overly articulate. Phrases like "to discover purpose in the pauses between moments of crisis" read as authorial summary rather than an embodied thought process under duress. The "steadily adaptive" trait is stated but not fully demonstrated, as the central discovery feels more like a magical insight than a pragmatic adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her backstory as a capsize survivor who lost her hearing. Her actions logically follow from her goal. However, her interiority lacks significant conflict; the story presents a challenge and a straightforward success without showing contradictory impulses or a moment of difficult trade-off within the scene, which keeps the characterization from feeling deeply dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his profession and personal anxieties about finality. The transformation from a weary man haunted by death to an eternal keeper is a strong arc. However, his core trait of being "inadvertently stubborn" is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible trade-offs, making his persistence feel slightly programmatic rather than a deep-seated, costly aspect of his character.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from the initial anonymous giving to the final public declaration. The transition is earned by external pressures. However, his characterization lacks significant internal conflict; his pivotal choice reads as determined and inevitable ("Elias knew what he must do") rather than a difficult, costly struggle, which slightly flattens his arc into one of noble competence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is well-defined and drives the narrative effectively. The transformation from a "pilgrim of sparks" to a "keeper of light" provides a clear and earned character arc. However, the interiority occasionally leans on telling over showing, with phrases like "Elara's motivation was clear" acting as diagnostic labels rather than embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "terrifying yet intoxicating" or "quaking reverie" instead of fully embodied, contradictory emotional states. The final choice is well-earned by her established obsession, but the characterization lacks the deeper, flawed specificity that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on telling over showing. Labels like "patiently strategic" and "staggering grace" are asserted rather than demonstrated, and her primary challenge is resolved by a convenient, unearned backstory ("a song her grandmother had taught her") rather than through a genuine struggle that reveals deeper traits.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and compelling, but the final epiphany feels more bestowed than earned. The shift from obsession with betrayal to an understanding of healing happens too smoothly, lacking a moment of genuine internal struggle or a costly choice. The final realization reads like a neat summary of a complex process, rather than a messy, embodied emotional shift under the pressure of his mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lillian's motivation is consistently held and drives the plot, but her internal conflict lacks on-page friction. Her primary traits—savvy, graceful—are demonstrated effectively in the heist. However, the stationmaster is a functional but thin obstacle, offering little pressure to reveal deeper character contradictions in Lillian before the final, more conceptual, shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority borders on diagnostic self-awareness. Lines like "This is how we melt what has grown too solid within" feel less like an authentic internal process and more like the character narrating the story's thesis statement. While the "dramatically narrating" tic is a strong choice, it's overused to make theme explicit, which slightly flattens the character's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's internal conflict is clearly established (phobias vs. professional daring), but its portrayal relies too heavily on summary and diagnostic labels. Phrases like "claustrophobia and cleithrophobia warred within her" and the mantra "Vulnerability is power" state the conflict rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory actions or perceptions. The final shift to "the authentic Maya" feels more like an intellectual realization than a visceral, earned transformation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle's motivation is clear and consistent, but the pivotal shift from "mildly obsessed" to "violently determined" feels more declared than embodied. The trigger is present (feeling the huddling masses), yet the emotional leap is abrupt, lacking the granular interiority to make such a powerful adjective as "violently" feel earned. The character remains a slightly archetypal figure rather than a fully particularized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's core motivation—to understand its thoughts—is clear and effectively drives its central choice to defy protocol. The internal conflict between its orderly function and its attraction to the violin's "chaotic beauty" is well-established. However, the final epiphanies are articulated with a degree of diagnostic self-awareness ("Its remarkably composed nature had been both a gift and a barrier") that slightly flattens the emotional impact of the transformation, reading more like a summary than an embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly, but largely through direct statement ("always been motivated by a desire to..."). The internal conflict between wielding power and choosing responsibility is resolved too quickly and rationally; the struggle lacks visceral embodiment. While her actions are consistent, she reads more as an idealized vessel for the theme than a character with complex, contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is singular and powerfully consistent, driving all his actions. His interiority is rich, particularly the connection between his own "withered state" and the garden's cycles. However, his self-awareness occasionally reads as too articulate, bordering on authorial summary, which slightly flattens the character's internal conflict into a resolved philosophy rather than a continuous struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies too heavily on labels like "profound excitement" and repetitive descriptors such as "mechanically warm." While the "icy warmth" concept provides a nice contradiction, the character's journey lacks any tangible struggle or flaw-driven misstep, making her feel more like a functional vehicle for the plot than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in an artistic and spiritual yearning that justifies his actions. The concept of a "wordless conversation" with the ghost is well-realized. However, his interiority occasionally relies on familiar abstractions ("something he couldn't name but felt in his bones") rather than a more particular, contradictory inner life, making him feel more like a sensitive vessel for the events than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his core trait as an “Edge-Seer” is skillfully dramatized through the key choice to smudge the illustration—an act violating his training that reveals his values under pressure. The character is well-realized. However, the interiority occasionally leans into slightly over-articulated self-awareness, as when he notes the “inverse suffering” even in delirium, which distances the reader from a fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear, but the core internal conflict between his "religiously skeptical nature" and his actions is asserted rather than dramatized. The skepticism dissolves too easily in the face of the psychic phenomena, making his final acceptance feel less earned. The character arc is present but lacks the friction of a genuine, on-page struggle with his established worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. The character's core trait—a loose grip on reality—is brilliantly inverted into an "anchor" at the climax, a sophisticated turn that justifies their unique capability. While the character is more of an archetypal observer than a complex individual, their single-minded purpose is tested and affirmed with a legible cost, satisfying the narrative's demands perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her backstory and philosophy. However, her interiority occasionally slips into self-summarizing therapeutic language ("This tiny treasure symbolized her core philosophy") rather than showing her contradictory impulses in the moment. The character arc is earned, but the expression of it lacks the specific, idiosyncratic texture that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The historian's motivation is clear and consistent, intensifying appropriately from collection to comprehension. However, the characterization relies heavily on the label "sensitively perceptive" to grant them insight, rather than dramatizing this trait through specific, costly actions or unique perceptual framing. The final smile provides a clear "after" state, but the character remains more of an archetypal vessel for the story's ideas than a complex individual with internal contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The writer's motivation is clear and consistent but lacks dramatized internal conflict. He is a vessel for the story's concept, and his profound purpose is asserted rather than tested through a difficult choice or contradictory impulse on the page. His actions are methodical and align with his goals, but the characterization remains at an archetypal level, missing the specificity of a flawed, struggling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Father Michael's motivation is clear and his competence is well-established, but his interiority lacks depth. Beyond his initial "trembling fingers," he reads as an overly controlled operator, with his "faint smile" undercutting the visceral struggle and personal risk. The character serves the cool concept effectively but doesn't embody a compelling internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, rooted in the singular concept of being "chronologically homesick." His interiority is well-rendered, and his final action—collapsing from the effort—provides a felt cost. However, the final paragraph shifts from his embodied experience to an abstract summary ("time had folded in on itself..."), slightly diluting the immediacy of his personal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The motivation is clear and consistent, but the character's climactic change feels more summarized than earned. The realization "Elias understood now that conquering the labyrinth meant accepting all parts of himself" is an intellectual summary rather than an embodied, contradictory experience. The internal conflict of gift vs. curse is stated effectively but isn't fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in the final beats, leading to a resolution that feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her emotional arc is compelling. The transition from numbness to tearful reawakening is well-embodied through the physical sensation of vibration. However, the reliance on diagnostic labels like "emotional numbness" at the outset and summary statements of her transformation at the end ("The tone of her existence was shifting...") slightly flattens the interiority, replacing concrete experience with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority feels overly articulated and diagnostic, as seen in the line, "He would nurture integrity in solitude, Elias reminded himself." The character lacks a compelling internal conflict; the path from discovery to decision is linear, with his trembling hands being the only hint of a struggle, which diminishes the earnedness of his final, brave choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal processing at the climax relies on over-articulated, diagnostic self-awareness. The line "...it wasn't the smells themselves that caused his pain, but the fact that these sensory memories had become bittersweet proof of both what was and what could never be again" reads more like a therapist's summary than an embodied realization. This intellectual distance weakens the emotional peak, abstracting the feeling instead of letting the reader experience it through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and singular, but the characterization relies on telling over showing. Traits like "ethically playful" and "passionate subtlety" are stated as labels rather than demonstrated through contradictory actions or specific micro-choices. While the poet’s obsession is compelling, their interiority feels more like a vehicle for the story's concept than the experience of a uniquely realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear but lacks compelling internal conflict; his journey is a gentle realization rather than a struggle. His family members function as a supportive chorus, existing to affirm the theme. The father’s line, "You have found beauty in the unfinished," is a critical flaw—a thematic echo that summarizes the story's core idea, robbing the character's journey of its earned, private weight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation and professional philosophy are clear, but his interiority relies heavily on summary and diagnostic labels ("fuse insight with empathy," "affectionate detachment"). The central paradox of his work is stated rather than dramatized through a choice under pressure in the scene. While consistent, the characterization lacks the friction of contradictory impulses being tested by an immediate obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks meaningful internal conflict. His path to compassion is too smooth, with his choices presented as inevitable rather than the result of a struggle or sacrifice. The final line's "carefully calculated" compassion hints at a cost, but this is never dramatized, leaving him feeling more like an archetype of kindness than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is the clear and compelling engine of the story. However, the supporting characters feel more like archetypes than individuals, and the transition to a bonded group happens too smoothly. The description of her empathy as "bold" feels told rather than shown, and the emotional resolution, while earned by the plot, lands with a tidiness that slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, culminating in a choice with a legible cost. However, the interiority feels generic, serving as a functional vessel for the plot rather than revealing a complex individual. His profession as an illustrator is stated but doesn't meaningfully shape his perceptions or choices beyond the initial observation, making him feel more like a stock fantasy protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the entire scene. Her internal conflict between hope and caution ("buried optimism surged... kept it carefully contained") is present, though it leans more towards statement than embodied action. The characterization is strong and consistent for a single-character piece, but lacks the deep, contradictory impulses shown simultaneously in-scene that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character’s motivation is clear and consistent, grounded in a plausible backstory. However, the story relies on stating this motivation directly ("to become visible to those who needed you most") rather than letting it emerge purely from action, which slightly weakens the interiority. The final choice to act indirectly is a strong character moment, reflecting a well-established internal conflict between purpose and self-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal transformation relies too heavily on summary. The shift from a data-obsessed scientist to an intuitive partner is a significant change, yet key moments like "her motivation had shifted" are told rather than dramatized, slightly undermining the "reluctant" aspect of her metamorphosis by abstracting the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motivation to “thresh meaning from experience” is clear and consistent. The central choice—exchanging a personal talisman for a communal responsibility—is a strong test of character. However, her interiority sometimes slips into overly articulate self-analysis, such as “transforming trauma into testimony,” which reads more like a summary of the theme than an in-the-moment thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s shift from a prideful seer to an active participant is clear, but her climactic change in motivation ("to magnify the everyday magic") is more of an asserted epiphany than a dramatized choice born of internal conflict. While her initial state is well-established, the transition feels frictionless, lacking a moment of genuine struggle or contradictory impulse as she embraces the new reality. The arc is legible but lacks the granular interiority of a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elina’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She functions more as a lens for the community's healing than as an individual with internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her competence is never in doubt and she faces no meaningful personal blind spots, which makes her feel more like an archetypal figure than a person. The emotional progression is observed in others ("transformation in their eyes") rather than embodied within her own experience on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ethan's motivation is clear, but his transition from a "meticulous" and "analytical" man to one who accepts a metaphysical reality is too swift. The internal conflict is stated ("a dare against his analytical nature") rather than dramatized through a moment of significant resistance or a difficult choice, making his transformation feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's characterization relies heavily on labels rather than demonstrated action. She is called a "natural skeptic" but immediately accepts the tile's magic, and her "courageously kind" nature is stated three times but only enacted in a single, frictionless decision. The internal conflict is summarized, lacking the simultaneous contradictory impulses required for a higher score; her skepticism never meaningfully complicates her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Alistair's motivation follows a clear arc from boredom to purpose, but the emotional journey is more summarized than embodied. Key shifts, such as his intrigue replacing boredom, are stated as fact rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or specific actions. The final epiphany feels like an intellectual conclusion rather than a deeply felt, character-particular transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict feels pre-resolved. Phrases like "The mathematics of this fair trade had occupied her thoughts for weeks" place the struggle in the past, making her on-page actions highly competent but lacking the friction of a simultaneous internal battle. Her fear is neatly "liquefied into focused determination," which undercuts the potential for embodied emotion in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, a strong anchor for the narrative. However, his interiority feels more described than dramatized, particularly in the key moment. The phrase "incandescent restraint—emotions held in perfect balance with intellect" is an elegant summary, but the story doesn't fully embody the struggle of maintaining that balance, making him feel more like a perfect instrument than a person experiencing internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling—a hunger for identity after bureaucratic erasure. The interiority is rich and specific, particularly the "palimpsest" metaphor. However, the protagonist's self-awareness is so consistently articulate that it sometimes reads more like a philosophical essay than the embodied experience of a flawed individual, slightly reducing the sense of internal contradiction acting out in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Evelyn's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, her interiority feels more functional than particular; emotions like "gloomy cheerfulness" are stated rather than embodied. The transition from a skeptical "myth buster" to an advocate for "beautiful uncertainties" is a crucial change, but it reads as a swift intellectual acceptance rather than a deeply felt, earned internal shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya’s motivation is clear, but the core internal conflict of "dual allegiance" is stated rather than dramatized. We are told about their struggle, but on the page, they act with frictionless competence, making the character feel more like a vehicle for the plot's clever mechanism than a person facing a difficult, contradictory choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on labels rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "purposefully curious" and "dawnlit melancholy" are stated and repeated, acting as diagnostic tags instead of emerging from contradictory impulses in the scene. While her actions are competent and driven, her interiority feels summarized, lacking the specific, granular texture that would elevate her from a functional archetype to a memorable individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The characterization of Elias is consistent and compelling, but his interiority occasionally slips into authorial summary rather than embodied thought. For instance, the line about seeking to "decode feedback into direction" is a thematic statement, not a character-particular impulse in a moment of pressure. His unwavering competence and kindness lack a contradictory impulse, which slightly flattens his internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elmsley's motivation is clear and compelling, and his methodical nature is well-established through action. However, his defining trait of being "dry-witted" is stated but never demonstrated, remaining a label. The interiority, while consistent, occasionally relies on stock phrases like "scholarly heart beat faster" instead of more specific, embodied emotion, which slightly undermines the otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is a functional archetype whose motivation is clear and consistent, but he lacks compelling interiority or internal conflict. His character is defined entirely by his mystical craft, making his actions inevitable rather than choices born of struggle. The "rare and cryptic expression" is a gesture towards depth, but the story relies more on his actions than his internal state, which keeps the characterization effective but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, hinging on the well-drawn conflict between her survival training and her scientific drive. The choice to override instinct is a strong, character-defining moment. However, the interiority occasionally relies on slightly stock phrasing ("anxious heart," "impossible quest"), which slightly tempers the specificity of her perspective under extreme duress.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation to separate himself from his father's legacy is clear and compelling. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through the recurring "hovering" motif, showing a man caught between stasis and action. The final choice to tell his own truth feels earned, a culmination of the internal struggle depicted throughout the piece. While strong, the highly stylized, repetitive prose occasionally generalizes the interiority, holding it just back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ghost bride's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, driving the narrative from a state of passive vigil to decisive action. Her final choice feels earned, rooted in a well-established backstory of love and debt. While her interiority is conveyed effectively, a deeper exploration of her contradictory impulses in the moments before the climax could have elevated the characterization further.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels like "hauntingly optimistic" rather than dramatized internal conflict. Her sleepwalking, while central to the plot, externalizes her agency, making her feel more like a vessel for the magic than a character making difficult choices. The lack of embodied struggle or contradictory impulses keeps the characterization strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and his internal arc from alienated observer to active restorer is well-executed. The change is earned through the accumulative process of his work. However, his interiority sometimes relies on diagnostic labels like "lost faith" rather than being fully embodied in contradictory impulses, which keeps it from the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her central transformation feels more summarized than dramatized. The shift from seeing her work as a "simple transaction" to a profound act of narrative creation is an intellectual epiphany, articulated in abstract terms rather than forged through a difficult, contradictory on-page choice. Her interiority is coherent but leans on diagnostic self-awareness, particularly in the line "she no longer simply created names, but crafted narratives," which tells the reader the outcome of an internal process instead of showing the struggle itself.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, particularly the central contradiction between her hidden purpose and her carefully crafted eccentric facade. This external behavior differing from internal experience is well-executed in the scene with the official. However, her internal state lacks dynamic conflict; her competence is absolute, and she exhibits no significant struggle, doubt, or cost beyond a pre-existing isolation, which keeps the portrayal from reaching exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("heart pounding against her ribs") and declarative emotional states. The key phrase "fierce tenderness" is repeated three times, functioning more as a thematic label than an embodied, contradictory feeling. The emotional progression feels slightly too tidy, moving through clean stages of resolution without the messiness of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted effectively in his backstory. However, his interiority sometimes uses diagnostic language ("lotus-hearted ache to this work," "decryption of a child's private language of loss") that feels more like an author's summary than a character's immediate, embodied thought. The internal conflict is muted; he is presented as highly competent and resolved in his purpose, which limits the sense of struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amelia's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary rather than embodied emotion, particularly in the resolution. The moment her "lost joy resurfacing like the colors from the stone" is a beautiful simile but reports on the change rather than letting the reader experience its complex, contradictory texture in a physical or perceptual way.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's motivation shifts clearly from professional duty to existential curiosity, but the transition is frictionless. The story describes her transformation through a series of serene epiphanies rather than dramatizing any internal conflict, doubt, or struggle. Phrases like "layers of understanding nested within her consciousness" serve as diagnostic labels for her change, lacking the embodied, contradictory emotion of a truly earned awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization as a "charming rogue scholar" remains an assertion rather than a dramatized reality. His interiority serves primarily to deliver exposition about the world's mechanics and his own purpose. The character functions more as an effective vehicle for the story's ingenious concept than as a complex individual with palpable internal contradictions acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    The poet's motivation is clear and potent, serving as a solid engine for this fable-like narrative. However, the character remains more of an archetype than a specific individual. Interiority is conveyed through abstract, poetic declarations ("to photosynthesize pain into beauty") rather than embodied, contradictory experience, which skirts the edge of diagnostic label-speak and keeps the character at a mythic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleth's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire plot. The interiority is concrete, particularly the "foxglove regret," which grounds the character's purpose in a specific emotional texture. However, the character sometimes feels more like a symbolic guardian than a person with deep internal contradictions; their actions are perfectly aligned with their role, lacking the friction of competing impulses that would elevate the characterization to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elena’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, but her characterization relies more on labels than on dramatized internal conflict. The "carefully reckless" attribute is stated but not shown through a specific choice where these two impulses are in tangible opposition. Her interiority, while consistent, often voices the story's key thematic phrases ("symphonies of truth"), making her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a person with a distinct inner life under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her emotional arc from anxiety to certainty is legible, anchored effectively by the recurring action of her hands trembling. However, her interiority occasionally relies on the story's thematic keywords ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") which feel more like authorial labels than organic character thought. The change to "tremulous confidence" is earned by the story's events, but the internal voice could be more specific and less of a vehicle for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation to reclaim her past is clear, but the internal journey from "fought to erase" to writing the revival letter feels more summarized than dramatized. The shift hinges on a somewhat mystical insight about dust motes rather than a more grounded, contradictory internal struggle shown in-scene. While the core desire is compelling, the path to her final, decisive action relies on an epiphany that feels more convenient than earned through sustained pressure or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core trait of "featherly determination" is consistently embodied. The final reunion is emotionally resonant, but the father's dialogue borders on diagnostic summary rather than authentic speech, slightly flattening his character into a thematic mouthpiece in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motivation to find “the rhythm of belonging” is clearly established and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is concrete, especially in the moment of discovery, where her wonder feels earned. The character reads as a competent professional whose specialized knowledge (astrology) is the key to understanding the story's central mystery, making her actions feel both specific and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The recollectionist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. Her internal state is well-defined, and the shift from haunted conjecture to knowing acceptance is earned through her actions. However, her interiority sometimes relies on repeated abstract phrases ("cheerful gloom") rather than more deeply embodied or contradictory impulses, slightly flattening the emotional texture in moments.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent. However, his flawless competence and lack of any visible struggle or significant internal contradiction make him feel more like an embodiment of a concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative toward its transformative conclusion. However, the characterization lacks deep internal conflict; her path feels pre-determined and certain. Interiority sometimes relies on abstract declarations ("Her motivation had always been clear") rather than embodied struggle, which keeps her at a slight emotional distance, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier of character work.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal journey culminates in an epiphany that feels more asserted than earned. The interiority relies on elegant but abstract labels ("noctilucent reckonings") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in the scene. The final change is profound but lacks the friction of genuine struggle; it reads as a foregone conclusion rather than a costly re-evaluation of her core beliefs.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority suffers from over-articulated self-awareness. Phrases like "Hard softness defined him" and his realization about honoring "vulnerability and resilience" read as the author's thematic summary rather than a character's raw thought process. This diagnostic language in peak moments of reflection undercuts the emotional authenticity, making the epiphany feel tidy and intellectualized rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's central contradiction as a "logical dreamer" is effectively demonstrated through his meticulous, mathematical actions pursuing an abstract, hopeful goal. Motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in an earned synthesis of his two halves. However, interiority occasionally relies on direct labels ("His logical mind warred with his dreaming heart") instead of fully embodied conflict, which slightly softens the portrayal of his internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions throughout the discovery process. However, the final shift from personal curiosity to accepting a "legacy's burden" is articulated through summary rather than a dramatized choice or embodied feeling. Phrases like "recognized the weight of this knowledge" act as diagnostic labels, telling us the emotional outcome instead of letting it land through a concrete action or perception, which keeps the characterization from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The painter’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal state contrasts effectively with her external calm. The character is slightly archetypal, relying on labels like "grace" and "perceptively calm" rather than consistently embodying those traits through contradictory micro-choices. However, the final emotional beat—the "familiar melancholy of separation"—provides a sense of genuine cost and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in personal loss and professional weariness. The internal conflict between idealism and experience is established well, particularly in the contrast between their glimmering eyes and lined face. However, the interiority occasionally slips into abstract summary ("anchor ideals in practice," "personal redemption") rather than staying fully embodied in the high-stakes moment of negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The characterization of Silas is strong, built on the compelling contradiction between his ruthless public persona and his secret sentimentality. This internal conflict is well-established through concrete details like keeping childhood toys and weeping at symphonies. However, the prose occasionally slips into diagnostic summary ("mirrored his own divided soul," "a small crack in his carefully constructed facade"), which slightly undermines the otherwise excellent embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on elevated abstractions rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Phrases like "the core of self that refused to be defined" function as diagnostic labels, keeping her an archetype of serene purpose rather than a complex individual. The central concept is strong, but the interiority feels performed at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear but static; his core trait, "uncommonly serene," is asserted four times, effectively neutralizing any potential for compelling internal conflict. While his actions align with his goals, his interiority is summarized through labels like "half-lit epiphany" rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The character reads more as a vessel for a theme than a person experiencing genuine struggle, making his ultimate success feel preordained and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from observation to ritual. The interiority is specific, particularly the "warm flush of purpose" that embodies emotion. However, the label "esoteric realist" feels slightly imposed, and the character's internal thoughts occasionally veer into articulating the story's theme with a bit too much precision, slightly undermining the sense of a genuine, contradictory internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted effectively in her past as a caster. Her specific skills—nimble fingers and a gentle touch—are put to a direct, high-stakes test. However, the internal conflict feels pre-resolved ("since the day she finally forgave herself"), making her journey one of execution rather than in-scene struggle. A line like "the quiet passion of one who knew their purpose" verges on diagnostic summary, slightly flattening the embodied emotion elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. However, her primary character trait, "precisely playful," is asserted more than demonstrated; her actions are deliberate, but the "playful" quality lacks concrete embodiment on the page. The final change feels more like an intellectual breakthrough than a deeply earned, embodied shift, making the character arc feel slightly schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    Anu’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in the central conflict between knowledge and faith. However, the character's interiority relies too heavily on summarizing labels like "empirically ironic" and "dusky harmony." The internal conflict is stated more than it is dramatized through contradictory micro-choices in the climactic scene, making the character feel slightly more like a thematic vessel than a person in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    Marcus's motivation is clear, but his transformation feels unearned. The shift from deep-seated resentment to acceptance happens too quickly, prompted by a vision rather than a difficult, internally-driven choice made under pressure. Elara's "scheming pacifist" label is inconsistent with her straightforwardly gentle and didactic actions.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mirror maker's motivation is consistently rooted in his core concept of "erasing boundaries," which gives his actions a strong philosophical underpinning. His expertise and dedication are well-embodied in his precise movements and deep focus. The final choice to grant the dream freedom rather than capture it is a satisfying character moment, but the internal conflict leading to this renunciation of the original goal feels somewhat smooth and inevitable, lacking a visible struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her central action—building the bridge—is a strong, character-specific expression of her "mender" identity. However, her interiority sometimes relies on summary ("deciduous vows flittered through her mind") rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses in the moment. The "feisty" trait is stated but not meaningfully dramatized, remaining a label rather than a force that complicates her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and consistent, driving his decision-making process from reflection to action. However, his interiority often relies on abstract conceptual language ("brightened disquiet of possibilities") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion, making him feel more like a vessel for the theme than a uniquely textured individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth due to an absence of meaningful struggle. Her interiority is articulated rather than embodied; we are told her heart is racing, but her actions remain perfectly calm and calculated. The story presents her as flawlessly competent, missing the opportunity for her resourcefulness to be tested against genuine, compounding obstacles, which flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract, repeated labels like "unkindled solace" and "blissfully aberrant." This gives her self-awareness a diagnostic quality that feels slightly unearned, particularly in the final epiphany which reads more as a conceptual summary than an embodied, contradictory choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but she lacks compelling internal conflict. Her "warmly methodical" nature is asserted rather than tested, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a person under pressure. The story avoids dramatizing any struggle or trade-off; she is perfectly competent, has all the right tools and knowledge, and succeeds without a single flaw complicating her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks depth. As a flawless and serene archetype, they face no internal conflict or meaningful struggle, which makes their journey feel more like a procedural execution than a personal trial. The character serves the concept well but remains emotionally distant.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. Her interiority, however, occasionally slips into abstract summary rather than embodied experience. The final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, as in "she understood that coincidences were not random at all," which tells the reader the theme directly instead of letting the preceding action carry the full weight of the realization.

    Elthion's motivation is clear and his interiority is consistent, but the characterization relies on a few diagnostic labels. The repetition of "preemptively nostalgic" is a minor abstraction that tells rather than shows, slightly weakening an otherwise strong portrayal of a man dedicated to his lonely purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks meaningful internal conflict. Elias operates as a near-perfect artisan executing a plan without struggle or doubt, making him more of an archetypal figure than a complex individual. The "serious playfulness" is a strong character note, but his success feels preordained, which flattens his emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya's motivation and interiority are clear and consistent. The character is well-defined as a "warmly observant" philosopher, and her internal shift is rooted in this trait. However, her epiphany is articulated with a degree of diagnostic self-awareness ("The texture of time, she now understood...") that feels more like authorial summary than an in-the-moment realization, slightly flattening the emotional authenticity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, rooted in a compelling internal conflict between her claustrophobia and her desire for transcendent silence. Her final change is earned through the climax. However, the interiority occasionally slips into abstract, diagnostic language ("her consciousness expanding while her body remained solid and present"), which slightly undercuts the otherwise well-embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and profound, and his actions are consistent with his character. However, his "fluidly logical" mind is more stated than shown; his actions read as more intuitive and artistic. He lacks a meaningful internal contradiction or struggle in the scene, proceeding with serene competence, which slightly flattens his arc from a successful execution into a demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She is presented as competent and wise, but there is no on-page struggle, internal conflict, or flaw that complicates her choices. The statement of "excitement and apprehension" is a label, not an embodied experience, and her final realization feels more like a thematic summary than an earned personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation to abandon her sanctuary is rooted in a sense of duty that feels more asserted than dramatized. The internal conflict is present but summarized ("Her purpose... resurfaced with painful clarity"), making her pivotal choice feel more like an inevitable fulfillment of a role than a hard-won personal decision. The struggle between her craving for solitude and the call to duty could be embodied more viscerally in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her backstory as a pyramid scheme survivor. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic label-speak, particularly the on-the-nose statement about hoping her "own character was being refined by life's challenges." This over-articulation lessens the impact of an otherwise solid emotional foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, but the characterization is thin, relying on labels like "eloquently silent" rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. He is more of a function for the plot than a complex individual; his competence is absolute, which removes any sense of genuine struggle or personal stakes beyond the mission. The story describes his state rather than letting his actions reveal a particular, flawed mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Galen’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. His interiority is well-embodied, particularly the physical responses to the mystical text ("fingers trembled," "hair on his arms stand erect"). The final change is earned, but the concluding realization ("He understood now why he had withdrawn... not from cowardice, but from an unspoken knowledge") borders on thematic summary, slightly flattening the earned complexity of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her own grief. However, her internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized through contradictory action. The final dialogue feels overly articulate and emotionally tidy, particularly Benjamin’s line, "I came back to feel connected to the child I was," which reads more like a therapeutic summary than a raw admission.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on labels ("carefully resourceful rebel") than demonstrated internal conflict. Her resourcefulness manifests as having the right tools at the right time rather than through difficult trade-offs. The dialogue with Theodor is purely functional, serving as exposition to set up the final puzzle, which flattens their interaction and limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ethan's motivation is exceptionally clear and singular, driving the narrative effectively. However, his interiority, while present, lacks significant contradiction or complexity; he reads more as a competent functionary of the plot than a character struggling with deeply ambivalent impulses. The final note on "eerie nostalgia for the burden" is a moment of genuine depth, but the preceding journey feels too emotionally linear for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She is presented as perfectly competent and serene, which lessens the narrative tension. The story tells us she is transformed, but we don't witness a genuine struggle or a choice born of contradictory impulses, making the final state feel less earned than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his central action—improvising a ladder from the symbols of his obsession—is a powerful dramatization of his change. However, his interiority sometimes relies on labels like "terrifying and liberating" rather than embodied experience. The final transformation feels slightly too neat, summarized in the concluding paragraphs rather than fully resting on the potent imagery of the cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal journey relies on abstract labels rather than embodied emotion. Key shifts, like the transition from despair to purpose, are announced ("he grasped the core principle") rather than dramatized. The final statement, "the balanced alchemist complete at last," is an unearned, tidy summary that flattens the complexity of his experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is well-established by his backstory and drives his unique methodology, a clear strength. However, his interiority relies on recurring thematic labels like "luminous ache" rather than fully embodied emotion. The final interaction with his "most challenging quarry" resolves with a frictionless tidiness that slightly undermines the setup, making his competence feel absolute rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and his trauma is viscerally embodied through strong sensory details like "the copper taste of fear." However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language ("sensory dissonance," "systematic deconstruction of his humanity") that feels more analytical than experiential. The whispered line, "Mercy isn't the absence of pain... but the presence of meaning," comes across as a direct thematic statement, slightly flattening the character's voice in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but the interiority, while lyrical, lacks conflict. The journey to the climax feels more like the fulfillment of a destiny than a struggle between contradictory impulses. The narrator's self-awareness ("I am simultaneously the child... and the adult") reads as a summary of the experience rather than an embodied, in-the-moment crisis, slightly flattening the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-integrated with his profession, providing a unique lens for his actions. The final choice to engage feels earned and completes his internal arc from observer to participant. The character is slightly weakened by the repetitive and somewhat self-conscious thematic phrase "weightless burden," which reads more like an authorial label than a fully embodied internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eldon's motivation is clear and poetically established, but his interiority lacks dramatized conflict. His obsession drives him in a linear fashion without the contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices that would elevate the characterization from a vessel for the concept to a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking his past as a failed revolutionary to his present, more nuanced goal. His "poetically inclined" nature is well-demonstrated through his actions, not just stated. The interiority is strong, though it occasionally relies on summary ("His motivation burned brighter") rather than showing contradictory impulses in the moment of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. He reads as a competent artisan executing a plan without any internal conflict, doubt, or meaningful struggle; his success feels preordained. The story misses the opportunity to reveal character through a moment of crisis or a difficult trade-off, making him more of a functional archetype than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively established by her unique hobby. However, her internal transformation, structured around the "hinged awakenings," feels more declared than embodied. The story asserts a fundamental shift without fully dramatizing the internal struggle or contradictory impulses that would make such a profound change feel earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation is clearly stated but feels more like a list of assigned traits ("spirited," "perpetually learning") than an embodied personality. Her acceptance of the supernatural vision is immediate, lacking the internal friction or contradictory impulses that create depth. The story tells us she has a "lifelong desire to scaffold complexity with simplicity," a diagnostic label that substitutes for a dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative effectively. Her defining trait, an artistic and obsessive curiosity, is well-established. However, her interiority, while lyrical, lacks significant contradiction; she reads as a serene vessel for the story's concept rather than a character with deep internal friction, which keeps the portrayal from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear but largely articulated through summary rather than dramatized through conflicting choices in a scene. Phrases like "became her obsession" and "desperate conviction" label her state rather than embody it. The transformation from "solemn" archivist to history-maker is a compelling arc, but its key beats are reported after the fact, which lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elior's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization relies more on intellectual summary than embodied emotion. The internal conflict is articulated rather than dramatized, making his progression feel like a logical, linear process. The story states he rejects false comfort, and his final actions align with this, but the struggle or temptation is not felt in-scene, rendering the change competent but not deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and undergoes a compelling shift from archivist to preserver. The internal conflict is well-realized, and his final acceptance of the new, heavier duty is earned. The emotion of "velvet disquiet" is a specific and memorable piece of interiority that avoids cliché. The final micro-choice to begin his new work demonstrates a clear change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Anya’s motivation is powerfully established by the “hatched egg,” grounding a high-concept goal in a visceral, personal stake. Her internal state of “furious tranquility” is a compelling, earned paradox shown through her meticulous actions. The final shift from detached recorder to an integrated part of time’s flow provides a satisfying closure to her arc, with the cost of confronting mortality felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a philosophical stance that drives his every action. However, his interiority lacks significant contradiction; he's presented as a man whose convictions are already fully formed, which flattens the potential for internal struggle in the story's present. His defining trait, being "credulously curious," is more told than dramatized with ambiguity, and his motivation feels more like a thesis statement ("to favor listening over noise") than a conflicted, deeply personal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elion's motivation is consistent and his final change is earned. However, his interiority often relies on abstract labels ("spiritually curious," "profound calm") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The character serves the story’s philosophical aims effectively but lacks the specific, granular detail that would make him feel like a unique individual rather than a thoughtful archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The recluse’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the character reads more as a thoughtful vessel for the story's theme than a person with deeply felt internal contradictions. The transformation from investigator to keeper is an intellectual epiphany ("the recluse understood then their purpose") rather than an earned choice forged through on-page struggle between competing impulses. While their actions align with their perceptive nature, the lack of a dramatized internal conflict limits the character's depth for a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is more summarized than embodied. Moments of high emotion like her heart racing or feeling terrified are stated rather than dramatized through perception or contradictory impulses. The final transformation feels more like an intellectual acceptance of a new role than a deeply felt, character-altering shift earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The poet's motivation is clear but her interiority lacks granularity and contradiction. Her thoughts are presented as fully-formed, eloquent summaries ("recognizing in this moment the very essence...") rather than an embodied, in-the-moment process of discovery. This over-articulation, a form of diagnostic label-speak, prevents a deeper connection, making her feel more like a thoughtful vessel for the theme than a character experiencing genuine internal struggle or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The "brazen calm" is a strong character trait, though it remains largely unchallenged by any contradictory impulse like despair or fear, making his interiority feel slightly too smooth. The struggle is externalized through his physical decline, which is effective, but a moment of internal conflict would have elevated the characterization further.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian's core contradiction between skepticism and rebellious seeking is well-established and drives the narrative. His motivation is clear, but the final transformation feels more declared than embodied. The line "The luminous skeptic smiled, finally free from his doubt" summarizes the change rather than showing the complex, contradictory emotions of such a profound identity shift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    The coachman’s motivation is clear and consistent, but he functions more as a mythic archetype than a complex character. Interiority is present but lacks contradiction or embodied struggle; his actions are driven by a singular, unwavering purpose. The character is effective for a fable-like narrative but lacks the psychological depth and internal conflict required for top-tier literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, providing a strong narrative engine. However, his defining "bloodhound" traits feel more like an applied skill-set than a deeply embodied perspective, particularly in the story's first half. While his actions are consistent, his interiority lacks significant contradiction or emotional texture beyond longing and determination, making his character arc more of a linear progression than a complex internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but articulated through abstract labels rather than embodied emotion. Her internal state is summarized with phrases like "felt the weight of her isolation but also the pull of purpose," which tells the reader her state instead of letting them experience it through her perception. The final shift feels more like an intellectual summary of the theme than a deeply earned, character-specific epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clearly stated and drives the plot, but key character traits like "chivalrous thief" and "sacredly playful" are asserted as labels rather than demonstrated through costly choices. The shift in his understanding of his own desires reads as a summary of an internal event, not the event itself. The characterization is functional for the fable-like structure but lacks the depth and contradiction expected for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistently rooted in her role as a historian of small gestures, and her internal state is well-realized. The contradiction of being "benevolently ruthless" is compelling, though its simultaneous action could be more deeply dramatized rather than summarized. The final choice to accept the cost of saving only one representative memory is earned and lands with appropriate weight, showing character endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maven's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the opening to the final realization. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly her initial sense of being lost. However, the internal conflict lacks sharp, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; it reads more as a linear progression from unknowing to knowing, especially after the "revelation struck... with the force of a blow," which feels more like an assertion than an earned, struggled-for insight.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tutor's motivation for redemption is clear, but his internal state is often summarized with diagnostic labels ("burden of guilt," "desperate need to forgive himself") rather than embodied through conflicting impulses in the present scene. The transformation from "arrogant man" to penitent is recounted rather than dramatized. The final reconciliation with the prince is too frictionless, lacking the complex, contradictory emotions of such a moment.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on declarative statements than embodied interiority. Phrases like "she had made peace with what forgiveness might cost" summarize her emotional state rather than dramatizing the struggle to reach it. Her "innocently mischievous" nature is asserted but not demonstrated in her actions, which read as earnestly defiant. The final stance is earned, but the internal journey feels more like a philosophical position than a lived conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcel's motivation is clear and compelling, and his interiority is well-rendered. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, shifting from embodied emotion into diagnostic self-awareness. The line "The kintsugi intentions of his work became increasingly clearer" is a summary of a realization rather than the raw experience of it, slightly flattening the character's final moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation, rooted in grief and his artistic promise, is clear and compelling. The character is consistent, and his internal state is well-embodied, particularly in the moment he finds the shell. The final choice to paint is earned and feels like a natural culmination of his journey. The interiority occasionally borders on being too diagnostic, as when the text explains "the concept consumed him," but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and potent, rooted in both intellectual curiosity and profound personal loss. The internal conflict is embodied well in the concept of "screaming tenderness," a powerful internal state expressed through a quiet action. Captain Morgan provides a solid, if conventional, foil whose shift in perspective validates Elias’s journey, although his characterization remains somewhat archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The characterization is strong, particularly in its physical grounding through the "patchwork" body, which serves as a potent metaphor for the story's themes of loss and repair. The navigator's motivation is clear and consistent. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into abstract thematic statements ("when the geography of loss became tangible, navigable terrain") rather than maintaining a fully embodied, in-the-moment perspective, which slightly distances the reader from the character's immediate emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation for psychological safety is clear and consistent, driving the narrative. However, her core trait of being a "rational" forager feels more like a label than a demonstrated practice, especially as she embraces a mystical ritual. The final epiphany is over-articulated, reading like a thematic summary ("the possibility of living fully again...") rather than a raw, character-specific realization, which slightly undermines the earnedness of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's character is consistent and his motivation—a mix of curiosity and disquiet—is clear. His established eccentricity provides a plausible foundation for his solitary investigation. The final transformation from isolation to connection is earned, but the process of receiving the "complete narrative" feels slightly passive, relying on summary rather than a final, embodied realization that forces a contradictory impulse or choice in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is established, but his internal state reads more as a consistent summary of loneliness than a dynamic, contradictory experience. The transformation at the end is articulated with diagnostic clarity ("solitude by choice rather than circumstance"), which somewhat lessens the emotional impact of the earned epiphany. The crucial decision to follow the ants feels abrupt, relying on the "empirically intuitive" label rather than a moment of embodied internal debate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The queen's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal transformation feels more bestowed by a magical event than earned through a complex internal struggle. The shift from "disenchanted" to "purposeful" is asserted directly rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in the climactic scene. Maera functions more as a wise guide archetype to deliver exposition than as a character applying crucible-like pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "scientifically romantic" core is consistent. The internal shift after the secret is revealed feels thematically earned, but the transition itself is more declared than embodied. Phrases like "anxiety and anticipation warred within her" are functional labels rather than concretely shown internal conflict, slightly flattening the character's experience in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is compelling and drives the narrative from start to finish. The internal conflict is particularly strong, especially the contradictory impulse of envying his past selves for their ignorance while despising their naivety. This internal state feels specific and earned, culminating in a credible recommitment to his purpose—a form of earned stasis—rather than a simplistic solution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority and dialogue sometimes state emotions and themes too directly. The shift from isolation to connection is earned, but the final exchange feels slightly too neat, particularly Lena's dialogue, which borders on diagnostic summary of the story's theme rather than a spontaneous utterance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her internal conflict—the drive for precision versus the fear of her crystallizing affliction—is embodied effectively. The micro-choice to rely on youthful superstitions provides a specific, textured coping mechanism that feels earned rather than convenient. Her contradictory impulses are dramatized well, particularly during the panic surge where her training and her grandmother’s memory battle the physical onset of crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eloise’s motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire scene. Her interiority is effectively shown through small, concrete actions like adjusting the perfume bottle. However, Beatrice's characterization feels less developed, functioning primarily as a catalyst for Eloise's arc, and her dialogue feels more like a thematic statement than the voice of a distinct individual.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the narrative. However, the witness functions more as a vessel for a cosmic process than a character with discernible internal conflict or embodied emotion. While the "solidifying" form provides a degree of embodiment, the overall characterization remains abstract, lacking the contradictory impulses expected for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    Arlo's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative, but his internal state reads as more of a philosophical treatise than an embodied experience. The final epiphany, while consistent with his goal, feels articulated with a intellectual neatness that sidesteps the messier, more contradictory emotions of a life-altering realization. The story summarizes his change effectively but doesn't fully dramatize the internal struggle leading to it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but overly articulated, leaning into diagnostic language like "the physics of letting go" instead of embodying that conflict through contradictory choices. The internal transformation described as a "quiet wildfire" is powerful but feels more asserted than earned through a granular struggle. Her shift from security specialist to galactic diplomat happens very rapidly, bordering on an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a deeply integrated internal conflict between Elena's professional skepticism and her personal mission. Her interiority is specific and sophisticated ("lucid contradictions she privately catalogued"). The character's core contradiction—a probability expert navigating the chaotic chance of her father's life—is the engine of the entire story, and her final shift toward accepting uncertainty feels earned and psychologically true.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear but suffers from being overly articulated. The line "his motivation was a peculiar one: to teach endings how to begin again" functions as a thematic label rather than an organic, dramatized desire. While his internal change is earned through the scene with Meredith, the initial framing of his motive feels more like authorial summary than character interiority, slightly flattening his complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and poignant, anchored effectively by the locket photo. His internal conflict—the "haunted euphoria"—is a compelling contradiction. However, this core emotion is sometimes stated with diagnostic clarity rather than fully embodied, slightly flattening the interiority; the repetition of the exact phrase "haunted euphoria" feels more like a label than a lived experience unfolding in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong. Archie’s central contradiction—the "desperately jocular" exterior masking profound loneliness—is established immediately and credibly drives his ambitious, unconventional plan. His motivation is clear, consistent, and compels the narrative forward. The final change, a re-evaluation of his goal, feels earned by the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elion's motivation is well-established and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The interiority is specific, particularly in how he perceives the world through touch. However, the final emotional transformation feels slightly over-articulated and summarized rather than fully embodied, as seen in the line, "The melody now sang of grief and acceptance, of loss and discovery," which reads more like a diagnostic label than an in-the-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in professional guilt that compellingly drives her to act. However, her core internal conflict of being "confidently uncertain" is repeatedly stated as a label rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in a moment of high pressure. The interiority leans on diagnostic summary ("Her motivation...had grown from guilt into determination") instead of embodied emotion, which slightly flattens the character arc into a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a compelling concept, but his characterization relies more on poetic labels than on embodied emotion or internal contradiction. His motivation of "joyful sorrow" is stated repeatedly rather than shown through conflicting impulses in the moment. The backstory reveal about his mother feels like a late-stage explanation designed to ground him, rather than an integrated memory that shapes a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maya's motivation for redemption is clear and consistent, but her defining trait, "analytically intuitive," is stated rather than demonstrated through a difficult, on-page choice. Her internal conflict is summarized, and the final change feels more imposed by the magical portrait than earned through an internal struggle. The character's core contradiction is compelling, but its resolution is too neat and externally delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elena’s motivation is powerfully clear and consistent, driving the narrative from her “heartbeat rebellion” to the climactic act. Her interiority is strong, though it occasionally relies on a key phrase like "auroral sorrow" as a label rather than purely embodied feeling. Her actions, particularly the drumming, are an excellent fusion of character trait and plot device, showing a competent protagonist whose defiance is both subtle and systematic.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlo's motivation is exceptionally clear and his competence is well-established through specific skills. However, his internal state lacks significant contradiction, making his victory feel smooth rather than hard-won. The antagonist, Vance, serves his function but is characterized with less nuance, acting more as a catalyst than a fully realized pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The characters function as archetypes in a fable, lacking concrete interiority or specific, contradictory impulses. Motivation is stated ("ancient duty") rather than revealed through choices under pressure. The visitor's transformation is asserted ("somehow transformed") rather than earned through a dramatized internal struggle, making the emotional arc feel more illustrative than authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arthur's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, his characterization lacks significant internal contradiction; once he identifies the problem, his path to the solution is linear and free of doubt or internal friction. The story shows his competence and commitment but misses an opportunity for deeper complexity by not dramatizing any personal cost or struggle with his "quiet rebellion."

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is present, particularly in the effective phrase "combative tenderness." However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary ("a battlefield of hope and fear") rather than fully embodied contradiction in the moment. The transformation is earned within the story's magical framework, but a sharper depiction of her contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, but his interiority relies too heavily on performative narration that doubles as self-diagnosis (e.g., "to polish my own rough edges"). This flattens the internal conflict between authenticity and performance into a stated theme rather than a felt, contradictory experience. We are told about his moral ambiguity but don't see it tested in a choice with immediate, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks depth. Interiority relies on declarative labels like "aesthetically driven soul" and "flame of defiance" rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The central transformation occurs without any visible internal conflict or struggle in the present scene, making the character feel more like a passive vessel for the story's concept than an active agent overcoming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to help Gideon is clear and altruistic, providing a solid emotional core. However, her "innocently cunning" nature is stated more than demonstrated through contradictory choices. The resolution gives her an unearned reward (restored color vision) which feels disconnected from her on-page goal and undermines the story's central theme of finding beauty in imperfection; she gets perfection as a bonus for seeking imperfection for someone else.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but she functions more as a thoughtful vessel for the story's theme than a fully realized individual. Her interiority is expressed in abstract, declarative terms ("to discover the texture of connection") rather than through embodied, contradictory impulses. The repetition of "powerfully gentle" acts as a label rather than a trait demonstrated through a choice with trade-offs, making her feel slightly one-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear and well-grounded in her backstory. However, her internal state is often summarized with labels like "subdued ardor" or "learning to carry it with grace," rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The character arc is legible as a transformation from hollow grief to purposeful action, but it reads more as a resolved portrait than an immediate, unfolding internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear, consistent, and well-rooted in his legacy project. His crucial micro-choice to confide in the visitor is the story's fulcrum. The characterization is strong, though his internal conflict during the moment of hesitation ("hesitated only a moment") could have been dramatized with more friction to heighten the tension of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation is earned. The central internal conflict of "anguish and joy" is consistent, but its repeated phrasing as a label, especially in the final line's "perfect convergence," slightly abstracts the emotion rather than letting it live entirely within the embodied experience. Her backstory is efficiently integrated to justify the high stakes of her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation, "to preserve the shape of hope," is clearly stated but feels more like a label than an embodied drive until the final revelation. The emotional shift to "luminous regret" is potent but is followed by several paragraphs of summary that abstract her changed state ("transformed from professional duty to personal mission") rather than showing it through a concrete micro-choice or moment of struggle. Her initial characterization as a meticulous observer is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak. Lines like "I need to reconstruct my understanding" and "balance self-respect with compassion" feel over-articulated, summarizing the emotional arc rather than embodying the contradictory impulses of a person mid-crisis. This therapy-speak flattens the character's internal struggle into a neat, intellectual exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her transformation feels more asserted than earned. The story relies on diagnostic label-speak, particularly in its climax, such as, "...they spoke of a different kind of healing: integration, not excavation." This over-articulated self-awareness undercuts the emotional reality of the moment, making her epiphany feel like a thesis statement rather than a deeply embodied character change.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear and deepened by the personal revelation that her "own heart had been a repository too." However, her interiority occasionally slips into abstract, diagnostic language ("quantum archive of feeling," "untended gardens of human emotion") that feels more like authorial summary than a character's immediate perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on overly diagnostic self-awareness. The epiphany, "To free trapped creativity... was not about silencing the world but learning to distill its infinite voices," reads more like a summarized thesis than an embodied, in-the-moment realization, slightly flattening the character's emotional journey at its peak.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guard’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between dreamless stasis and remembered hope provides a solid foundation. The final change is impactful, but the trigger feels more symbolic than causal, making the shift from "dreamless" to "dreaming" feel slightly unearned. The Archivist's brief appearance effectively externalizes the guard's internal struggle, particularly with the line, "yet never fully present where you're needed most."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on abstract labels rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "hum of insight began vibrating through his consciousness" and "crescendoed into comprehension" function as diagnostic summaries, telling us about the epiphany rather than letting us feel it through his specific, contradictory perceptions under pressure. The character reads more as a vessel for the concept than a person experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The characterization serves the mythic tone but lacks deep interiority. Maris and the guides function as a collective archetype, their motivation clear and consistent but without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The final realization ("we become the ferry guides of courage") feels more like a conceptual revelation assigned to the character rather than an earned, personal transformation rooted in prior, specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Characterization is strong and internally consistent. The bellhop's journey from passive healer to active agent is compelling, and his motivations are clear. The internal conflict between the desire for safety and the need for musical expression is well-embodied, particularly in the line "frostbitten hope." The score is held back from the 9-band by the slightly over-articulated epiphanies near the end, which summarize his realization rather than letting it remain fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but the final climactic realization that the pretender is her own fear feels more like an asserted epiphany than an earned one. The story lacks a moment of dramatized internal contradiction where she actively struggles with this possibility before accepting it; the change is more of a conceptual shift than a visceral, character-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted effectively in her childhood experience. Her defining action—the rhythmic tapping—is a strong, character-particular detail that resonates with the story's themes. However, her internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized; the final shift feels like a rational epiphany rather than an emotionally contradictory choice, and the line "feeling both drifting and moored" is a diagnostic label that slightly lessens the embodied impact.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation begins as a vague "seeking something she couldn't name," but compellingly crystallizes into a defined purpose. The transformation from "awkwardly confident" to "regal" feels slightly accelerated for this length. While her interiority is present, it occasionally relies on summarizing emotions ("she felt most alive") rather than fully embodying them in perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation as an "insurgent grandmother" is clear and consistent, providing a strong foundation for her actions. Her internal conflict regarding prophecies versus newfound destiny is present, but her emotional progression from frustration to solution feels somewhat linear. The characterization is strong and specific, yet the final epiphanies are more stated than embodied, slightly softening the impact of her earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority occasionally lapses into overly articulate, diagnostic language ("somatic markers," "intrusive memories") that feels less like embodied emotion and more like self-analysis. The characterization is weakened when she becomes a mouthpiece for the theme, as in the line "To anchor optimism in realism was to accept both," which summarizes her internal state rather than dramatizing it as an earned, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is present, but her self-awareness sometimes reads as overly diagnostic ("cloying sadness of failure," "descend into necessary darkness"). The emotional progression is legible, but the epiphany feels slightly too tidy, lacking the friction of genuine contradiction in the final moments. Her internal state is well-articulated but could be more deeply embodied through contradictory physical action rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. The internal contradiction of "serene anger" provides a strong core, and its transformation into "awe" marks a clear, earned change. However, the character's voice occasionally slips into declarative summary, and the final line of dialogue turns them into a mouthpiece for the story's theme, slightly flattening the earned nuance of their experience.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and her arc from preserver to liberator is well-defined. However, the interiority relies too heavily on declarative statements and labels. Phrases like "bravely conflicted" and "Her motivation crystallized" function as diagnostic summaries rather than embodied, contradictory experience, which keeps the characterization from achieving top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The characterization establishes a clear, consistent identity for Rhiannon, defined by her rejection of her father's violent legacy. Her motivation is lucid, and her actions align with her values. However, the internal conflict feels resolved rather than active; she is a portrait of tranquility, not a character actively wrestling with contradictory impulses in the scene. Traits like being "senselessly perceptive" are stated rather than dramatized with tangible cost, making her feel more like an emblem than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fisher's motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait, "cool-headed," is demonstrated effectively at the climax. However, the interiority feels more conceptual than embodied; emotions and thoughts are often described with elegant labels ("motivation burned steady," "patient heart") rather than being filtered through a specific, contradictory sensory experience. The character serves the mythic concept flawlessly but lacks the deeper psychological friction that would elevate him from a perfect archetype to a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear but her characterization is static and overly competent. Her "devotedly observant mind" and "practiced precision" solve the case with no depicted struggle, missteps, or internal conflict, which flattens her arc into a simple execution of a skill. The transformation of "regret" to "determination" is asserted rather than earned through a crucible moment, making her read more like a narrative function than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in his backstory. The internal conflict is poignantly dramatized, not just summarized, culminating in the action of tattooing a new constellation—a powerful, embodied choice that externalizes his internal shift and provides a perfect, character-specific closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his defining attribute is well-dramatized through his artistic solution. However, his internal conflict remains somewhat abstract; the "lilac unease" is a label that isn't fully embodied with contradictory impulses in the moment of crisis. The zealots function more as a plot device to trigger the climax than as characters with legible interiority, slightly flattening the central confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear but overly articulated through abstract labels like "gentle radical" and ornate phrases like "to cradle empathy in arms of steel." This declarative approach summarizes his character rather than allowing it to emerge through contradictory impulses in scene. The story tells us his compassion is like steel, but we don't feel the internal friction that would make this trait earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and poignant, rooted in his love for his wife and his art. The conflict between his desire for endless encores and the need for a final, healing performance is well-established. Interiority is strong, especially the synesthetic perceptions, but occasionally dips into summary, as in "Nostalgia washed over him," which tells rather than embodies the feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling due to her brother's condition. The central internal conflict between her "affectionate" hope and her "skeptic's mind" is well-established, providing a strong throughline. However, the resolution feels slightly abrupt, with the final sentence delivering the change rather than dramatizing the final moments of the shift. The constant labeling of her traits ("affectionate skeptic") verges on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maya's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the plot, but her characterization lacks depth. The narrative relies on stating her purpose and epiphanies, such as "She finally understood why," rather than dramatizing a complex internal process. She functions more as a perfect key for a predestined lock, with her journey lacking the friction of internal conflict or meaningful flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("Her motivation crystallized") rather than earned through internal conflict. Her transition from a solitary worker to a community leader is a significant change, but her interiority is conveyed through summary ("felt a profound connection") instead of embodied emotion, which makes the arc feel more conceptual than personal. There is little sense of struggle or contradictory impulse in her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is palpable. The transition from a shattered man seeking abstract courage to one with a concrete purpose is well-executed. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic self-awareness, as in "rebuilding what was never truly yours to begin with," which slightly lessens the emotional immediacy of his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    The coachman is a consistent and well-realized figure, with his motivation rooted in a sense of generational duty. His interiority is conveyed effectively through his sensory focus on the environment. However, the explicit statement "To distill complexity into essence was his motivation" reads less like a character's internal drive and more like an authorial thesis statement, a piece of diagnostic label-speak that momentarily flattens his otherwise subtle characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "zen-minded potter" persona. However, his interiority occasionally slips into direct thematic summary ("This phenomenon, Kael realized, was why..."), which feels more like an authorial explanation than an organic epiphany. The repetition of "sharp gentleness" also functions more as a convenient label than a deeply embodied trait.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but stated more than embodied. The story relies on diagnostic labels like "wistfully pragmatic heart" and "Protected vulnerability" instead of dramatizing these states through contradictory action. Jim’s character serves primarily as an expository device, and his immediate recognition of Mara feels overly convenient, weakening the realism of the encounter. The core emotional progression is legible, but lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her internal arc resolves through a realization that feels more summarized than dramatized in a final, difficult choice. The interiority is rich but occasionally veers into diagnostic statements like "to translate this profound isolation into genuine independence," which slightly lessens the feeling of an earned epiphany. The internal conflict is well-established, but the final coalescence feels a bit too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her internal conflict is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized in the present scene. Her climactic change is an unearned epiphany, presented as a sudden, frictionless understanding rather than an embodied struggle. The characterization relies on abstract labels ("inevitably whimsical," "feeling emptier") instead of showing contradictory impulses through action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the plot. However, her interiority relies more on summary (e.g., her obsession is stated) and labels ("cautiously hopeful," "ethereal grit") than on embodied, contradictory emotions in the moment of crisis. The character is highly functional for the plot but lacks the deeper, particularized internal conflict expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on convenient labels like "prudently adventurous" and "wistful rebellion" rather than dramatizing these contradictions in scene. The sudden, complete fading of her lifelong claustrophobia at the end feels unearned, resolving a core internal conflict too neatly. The terror and exhilaration during the climax are well-handled, but the overall arc lacks the nuance of a truly top-tier character study.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's characterization is clear and consistent, with her face-blindness providing a unique professional lens. Her motivation is explicitly stated but lacks an internal, contradictory struggle, making her journey feel more like a competent procedure than a personal test. While her methodical nature is well-demonstrated, her ultimate insight relies more on standard deduction than a climactic use of her unique perceptual abilities, slightly underselling the promise of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli's motivation is consistently rooted in honoring their ancestor, and this drive compellingly escalates to the final choice. However, interiority relies on labels like "nervously confident" and "spongey dread" rather than fully embodying these contradictory states in action. Dr. Aris serves her function as a secondary character to apply light pressure and receive exposition, but the central character's internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is established and directly ties to the climactic choice, providing a clear arc from grief to action. However, the interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic self-awareness ("he understood his motivation," "a chance to reshape reality"), which feels more like an authorial summary than an embodied, in-the-moment realization. This slightly undercuts the emotional authenticity of his transformation, making it feel more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation to escape his father's legacy is clear and compelling. However, his defining trait of "polished calm" is over-articulated through direct labeling ("perceptively calm") rather than consistently embodied. While moments like the "slight tightening around his eyes" show this trait effectively, the repetition of the exact phrase feels like a diagnostic label, reducing the character's interior complexity to a recurring tag.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("tormented," "slipping away like sand through fingers"). The internal conflict over sharing the burden is absent; she moves to collaboration without a visible struggle or trade-off. Dr. Thorne is a functional but archetypal wise mentor, lacking unique pressure or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The druid's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on the repeated label "warlike serenity" rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. Her competence is never in doubt and she never wavers, which flattens her arc and reduces the sense of struggle. The story shows what she does, but offers limited insight into a unique, contradictory inner life under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The visionary’s motivation is clear, but their interiority relies on telling rather than showing. Phrases like "purposefully curious" and the repeated "anxious elation" are labels that summarize emotional states instead of embodying them through specific, contradictory actions or perceptions. The final change feels more like a sudden, unearned epiphany than a character arc earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her traits of "fierce gentleness." However, the core internal conflict between her past "recklessness" and learned "patience" is presented as a resolved backstory rather than a contradictory impulse acting within the scene. Her actions are competent and resolved, which is effective but lacks the deeper tension of a character actively struggling with contradictory parts of herself in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between professional precision and personal grief is well-embodied. The backstory is substantial but successfully integrated into the present action, meeting the BRR. The characterization is strong, though a line like "...set him on this path to discover purpose beyond grief" veers slightly into diagnostic summary rather than showing the contradiction in-scene, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her defining traits are asserted rather than demonstrated. We are told she has "kindly methodical precision" and is different from her "haunted" predecessors, but her process is summarized as a flash of analogical insight, not shown as a struggle against the obsession that drove others mad. The internal conflict is stated ("exhilarated and terrified") rather than embodied in contradictory actions or thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The librarian's motivation is clearly stated but lacks dramatization. The central internal conflict—accepting contradiction—is presented as a resolved state ("no longer fighting the changes") rather than an active struggle within the scene. This makes the character feel more like a vessel for the story's concept than an individual with contradictory impulses acting under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The inspector's motivation is handed to her externally by the magical apparatus rather than emerging from a compelling internal struggle. Her transformation is an instantaneous, unearned epiphany ("Her motivation crystallized with sudden clarity") which makes her less of an active agent and more of a passive vessel for the theme. The characterization lacks the friction of contradictory impulses before the magical resolution is provided.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority effectively establishes the central conflict between clarity and pain. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of diagnostic self-awareness, such as being "daringly methodical in her embrace of emotion," which labels the feeling rather than embodying it and slightly undermines the raw emotion the story otherwise builds toward.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "veiled dreamer" remains more of an archetype than a person with particularized interiority. Emotions are often labeled ("cautious exuberance," "trepidation and anticipation") rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses or specific sensory details. The final change is more of an intellectual realization than an earned, costly shift in being, as the character's internal landscape was not deeply established enough for the transformation to feel profound.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, and her interiority is powerfully embodied in the recurring "mulberry ache," which provides a strong emotional anchor. Her final choice to propagate is a decisive act of character, showing her values. The story would be even stronger if her internal conflict before landing on the final plan felt more like a struggle between competing impulses rather than a linear problem-solving sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply felt and consistent, rooted in the well-integrated backstory of her sister. Her actions align perfectly with her stated purpose, creating a poignant and believable character. The final line of interiority—"she knew her purpose"—is a minor flaw, as it summarizes a realization the preceding action has already beautifully dramatized, slightly flattening the earned emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on labels ("committed caretaker," "kindly decisive") than on dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her epiphany feels more asserted than earned through on-page struggle. The interiority sometimes slips into diagnostic self-awareness, as when her "kindly decisive wisdom cultivated through decades helped her see the betrayal as necessary," which summarizes rather than embodies the process.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is conceptually strong, but characterization relies too heavily on descriptive labels like "cloak of doubt" and "sincerely insincere." This creates a sense of diagnostic summary rather than showing the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, particularly noticeable in the phrase "sincerely insincere demeanor," which tells rather than demonstrates.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elien's motivation is clear but undermined by the final sentence, which retroactively reframes his mentorship as transactional. This "payment" for wisdom is unearned, appearing without setup and cheapening his character. Maya's arc is functional, but her internal state is conveyed more through reaction than through specific, contradictory interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization relies heavily on the "wise, patient seeker" archetype. His interiority is often stated ("historically reverent," "weathered resolve") rather than revealed through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. While functional for a mythic tale, he serves more as a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual whose flaws or internal struggles drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. The micro-choice to unstrap the Regulation Pack is a strong, embodied moment of character change. However, the resolution feels summarized; his transformation into a "pioneer" and the effect on his colleagues are told rather than shown, which slightly undercuts the earned nature of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hemingway's motivation is clear and serves the narrative, but he functions more as a worthy vessel than a character with complex interiority. His journey is largely passive, being "pulled by an inexplicable magnetic force" rather than making a series of difficult choices. The final vow provides a sense of agency, but the internal conflict leading to it is understated, relying on the archetype of the faithful guardian rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    Loran's motivation is clear but abstract ("wavelength align with purpose"). The primary character trait, "quiet enthusiasm," is repeatedly stated as a label rather than embodied through contradictory action or specific perception. Assistant Korin serves more as a device to voice "stellar doubt" than as a character applying meaningful pressure. The final shift from doubt to hope is too swift and total, lacking the texture of a genuinely earned emotional change.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The reaper's motivation is exceptionally clear, and his internal transformation is earned through a specific, character-driven choice. The backstory of his love for Elara is integrated seamlessly, fueling the present conflict without slowing momentum. While the interiority is strong, the on-the-nose declaration "I'll name you Solitude" verges on diagnostic label-speak, just shy of the full embodiment required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mage's motivation is clear and his defining traits—"lukewarm" and "earnestly naive"—are effectively inverted to become strengths. The arc from mediocrity to growing power is earned. However, the character's final, earned understanding is undercut by the last paragraph, which summarizes his journey with a thematic statement, replacing authentic interiority with an authorial moral.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thomas's motivation is clear and undergoes a compelling shift from passive storyteller to active truth-teller. The shift is earned by the personal discovery of his aunt. However, his internal reaction to this profound revelation—that he has been upholding a false narrative connected to his own family—feels too smooth and intellectually resolved, lacking the embodied, messy emotional conflict of such a discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation to harmonize logic and intuition is clear and consistent. However, the internal conflict between her analytical and sentimental sides is stated more than dramatized; during the ritual, these two aspects cooperate seamlessly rather than creating genuine friction or forcing a difficult choice. The "secretly sentimental" trait adds a nice texture but doesn't visibly constrain or enable a choice within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characterization is functional but relies on archetypal duty over specific interiority. The watcher's motivation is clear and consistent, but the internal state is conveyed through labels like "dread" and "burden" rather than deeply embodied contradictions. Repeated phrases like "Attentively inventive" act as character tags rather than emerging traits, making the protagonist feel more like a role than an individual under unique pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-defined, but her characterization relies on diagnostic labels like "ego death survivor" and "emotional numbness" rather than fully embodied experience. The final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("a bridge between opposites, a vivifier of dormant potential"), coming across as a summary of her change rather than a raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization lacks depth and internal contradiction. She functions more as a thoughtful archetype for "the creative mind" than a flawed individual. The repeated label "notably receptive mind" is told rather than shown, and her interiority feels more like a philosophical treatise than a specific person's thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation is powerfully rendered and his internal conflict is embodied through his bizarre, specific actions. The character’s contradictory state—a "mournfully eager" desperation—is sustained well, leading to an earned, quiet shift in the final moments. The arc from frantic ritual to soothed acceptance is both credible and moving.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's motivation is clear, evolving credibly from homesickness to a philosophical embrace of uncertainty. Interiority is mostly concrete, though it occasionally drifts into abstract self-awareness ("befriending it was to befriend reality itself") that feels more like authorial summary than a character's thought process. The final change is earned by the established practice of "interiorizing exteriors," making the transformation feel like a consequence of long discipline rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation to break from his "stifling destiny" is clear and consistent. The central contradiction of his "stoically sensitive" nature is demonstrated, though occasionally stated too directly (e.g., "revealing the sensitive heart that remained stoically hidden"). The final emotional shift to a "rare expression" of a smile is earned by the preceding struggle, successfully foreclosing his past with a felt cost of sorrow mixed with joy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and her actions are consistent with her goal. However, her interiority often relies on summary and abstract declaration rather than embodied experience. The struggle to "discard assumptions" is stated as a necessary method but the internal conflict lacks granular texture, reading more as a successful philosophical exercise than a difficult, contradictory process.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liam's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly linked to the central conflict. However, his primary trait, being "resiliently positive," is stated twice rather than being fully dramatized through a difficult choice where optimism costs him something. His competence is asserted ("understood the physics better than most") more than demonstrated through struggle, making his victory feel slightly less earned. The internal contradiction of his fractured self is well-conceived but resolved without a moment of genuine doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is strong and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, his interiority relies on conceptual labels like "rational enchantment" rather than fully embodied emotion. The final epiphany, while clear, feels somewhat articulated rather than earned through a granular internal struggle, bordering on a diagnostic statement of his change.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot. However, his interiority tends towards intellectual summary ("his motivation crystallized") rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. The character reads as a competent vessel for the story's concept but lacks the deeper contradictions that would elevate him into a truly memorable figure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's core motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary character trait, "persistently curious," is stated as a label twice rather than dramatized through her choices. The internal conflict is more of a linear puzzle-solving process than a struggle between contradictory impulses. While the final change is earned, the characterization relies on summary and telling, which keeps it from reaching the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in personal loss and a sense of duty. The internal conflict of her claustrophobia provides a good counterbalance to her competence. However, the struggle is sometimes summarized ("she maintained steady breathing") rather than fully embodied, and the cost of her mission ("cost her friends and career") is stated as backstory instead of being felt as an active pressure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, the internal journey leans on self-aware, diagnostic epiphanies, particularly the realization of the "lesson about the systems we create." This undercuts the emotional embodiment of the discovery, making the final change feel slightly more intellectual than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The storyteller's motivation is powerfully singular and clear, driving the narrative effectively. However, the characterization lacks depth and internal conflict; he functions more as an archetypal figure of pure dedication than a complex individual whose resolve is tested, preventing a truly resonant emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation is well-established and evolves from bitterness to wonder, which is compelling. However, this internal transformation is often summarized with labels like "their motivation gradually shifting" rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in a specific moment. The character arc feels more narrated than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elayn’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot. However, her interiority lacks texture; she proceeds with unwavering competence and little internal conflict. A moment of doubt or a choice between two competing goods when facing the statues or the tree would have elevated the characterization from archetypal to individual.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as a "respectfully rebellious" mailman is clear and consistently dramatized through his actions and internal monologue. His competence is balanced with embodied adrenaline during the climax. However, the final paragraphs shift from showing his character to summarizing his symbolic function ("Elias had become the glue"), which slightly flattens the characterization into a thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the execution relies more on direct statement than embodied action. The key internal conflict—"Fear warred with desire"—is labeled rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. While the final change is earned within the story's magical logic, the interiority lacks the specific, granular texture that would elevate it to exceptional, reading more like a well-realized archetype than a particular individual.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margaret's motivation is the unwavering engine of the plot, and her defining trait, "sanely eccentric," provides a consistent filter for her actions. However, the characterization lacks a potent internal conflict or a moment of contradictory impulse; she is single-minded in her pursuit, which makes her compellingly devoted but slightly less complex under pressure. The final emotional expression is earned, but the journey to it is one of execution rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the story's emotional core. However, her interiority, while poetically described, relies on summary ("she was searching for a cipher of longing") rather than showing contradictory impulses in the moment. The final realization feels more like an received epiphany than a choice born from a dramatized internal struggle, which keeps it from the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, but he lacks compelling internal conflict. He functions more as a hyper-competent archetypal figure than a character with contradictory impulses or vulnerabilities tested by the mission. The story describes "the exquisite agony of a thought struggling to be born," but this is an external observation; Silas himself proceeds with an unflappable professionalism that lowers the personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc is satisfyingly complete. However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary statements like "Understanding washed over her with sharp clarity," and repeated labels such as "chronically curious nature," which feel slightly told rather than fully embodied in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist's characterization is strong, with a clear motivation (mentoring resilience) and an internal conflict shown through his nervous habit versus his authoritative teaching. The "combative tenderness" is a particularly effective and specific trait that is well-demonstrated. Prisha's arc from nervous apprentice to focused practitioner is earned on the page, providing a satisfying "after" state that confirms the archivist's success and validates his methods.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The pruner’s motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction. She exists as a serene archetype—a vessel for the theme—rather than a complex individual with conflicting impulses. Interiority is conveyed through abstract labels ("insatiably creative") and summary ("felt a swell of triumph") instead of embodied, specific emotion, which makes the character feel more symbolic than human.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait—her "brokenness"—is effectively linked to her unique spiritual sensitivity and skill. The internal conflict is present, with her sanctuary being both refuge and prison. The final change, a "tiny section of her own damage repaired," is subtle and earned. However, the interiority occasionally leans on diagnostic labels ("a visible marker of the turmoil within") rather than purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her character is conveyed through declarative labels ("perceptive," "methodically curious") rather than dramatized through choices made under pressure. Her interiority remains intellectual and avoids messy, contradictory impulses, making her journey feel more like a successful academic exercise than a personal struggle. The epiphany is earned by her process, but the lack of any on-page frustration or doubt lessens its emotional cost and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively blending her professional role with a personal quest. The internal conflict culminates in an earned emotional release. However, the direct statement of her motivation—"to understand the physics of letting go"—borders on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly flattening the subtlety of her interiority in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but delivered via direct summary ("stemmed from her own childhood of silence"). While consistent, this bypasses the opportunity to reveal it through a more embodied micro-choice or internal contradiction. The character reads as a consistent but somewhat archetypal vessel for the theme rather than a person with deeply felt, contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her “warmly inquisitive nature” and compassion. Her interiority is well-rendered during the ascent, but the final paragraphs shift from embodied experience to over-articulated summary. The line "...it had affirmed her belief that everyone concealed both joy and anguish" is a diagnostic label that weakens the earned nuance of her discovery, replacing a felt state with a generalized thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dr. Vasquez's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in professional conviction and personal loyalty to her mentor. Her interiority, however, occasionally veers into abstract, thesis-like statements ("Elena believed in spooled wholeness") rather than fully embodied thought under duress. While her actions are aligned with her motives, the emotional progression feels slightly too composed for someone in a life-threatening situation, missing the sharper edges of internal conflict between survival instinct and scientific focus.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, evolving logically from her initial project to the final masterpiece. Her face blindness is not just a trait but the engine of her unique perception, making her discovery of the coin feel earned. The interiority is strong, but a few moments of self-aware summary, like "a realization that both liberated and constrained her," verge on diagnostic label-speak rather than purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eli's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the plot, but his characterization relies on labels like "diligently curious" rather than dramatized internal conflict. His interiority is functional, showing a linear progression from curiosity to awe, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The concept of "sociable isolation" is compelling but remains an assertion rather than a felt experience that complicates his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative forward effectively. His interiority is functional but relies on archetypal language ("motivation burned stronger than the cold") rather than character-particular detail. The final shift from seeking knowledge to accepting a place in a tradition is earned by the story's mythic logic, but the characterization itself lacks the contradictory impulses or specific flaws that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.1)
    The characters are defined by single, convenient traits—Elion's "altruism" and Aris's "strangely trustworthy" nature—which serve as plot functions rather than sources of genuine character. There is no interiority, contradiction, or embodied emotion; motivations are stated directly, preventing any sense of earned choice or change. The story tells us about a community's transformation but never shows the individuals within it wrestling with the central crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, providing a strong anchor for the story. Elias reads as a dedicated, weary figure, and his "bruised awe" is a compelling internal state. However, the characterization remains more archetypal than individual, lacking a moment of demonstrated internal contradiction or a difficult micro-choice on the page; he is resolute from start to finish, which slightly lessens his dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation and subsequent transformation are clear and form a coherent arc from reluctance to purpose. The contradiction between his "ragged appearance" and "offhandedly exact" nature, and his "graceless beauty," adds welcome texture. However, the final internal shift is overly summarized in the concluding paragraphs, telling the reader "he realized," "he felt at peace," rather than letting the final embodied actions carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is established, but her epiphany and subsequent emotional progression feel overly articulated and tidy. Phrases like "Her motivation crystallized" and the self-aware "The polymer chemist in her appreciated the elegance of this parallel" read as authorial summary rather than embodied interiority. The resolution, while earned, lacks the messy complexity of a real reconciliation, making the character arc feel slightly schematic and less authentic than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The vendor's motivation is clear and central, but the final epiphany feels more like a sudden intellectual insight than a deeply embodied, earned change. The character's internal state shifts from reflective waiting to "profound peace" based on a conceptual realization, which is stated rather than fully dramatized. The transition lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, and his final change is earned. However, his interiority sometimes relies on direct, slightly clichéd statements like "blessing and curse." The actual struggle against being subsumed is more asserted than dramatized, making his competence feel a bit too smooth and slightly lowering the on-page tension of his internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist, Elena, is a primary weakness. She functions more as an archetype of perfect competence than a believable character, equipped with the exact skills needed to solve the story's central problem without struggle. Her interiority is summarized with labels ("empathetically decisive grace") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices, making her journey feel frictionless and her success preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    The engineer's motivation is clear but abstract, relying on the label "archeologist of abandoned dreams" rather than a more personal, grounded need. Interiority is dominated by repeated thematic jargon ("helix-mind," "chaotically precise") which feels like diagnostic self-awareness rather than an organic thought process. The emotional transformation is described as profound but occurs without sufficient on-page struggle or contradiction, reading more as a smooth, inevitable process than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on repeated labels like "prism-minded" and "latent blaze" rather than on embodied emotion or internal conflict. She is highly competent, which is fine, but her journey lacks a sense of personal struggle or a difficult choice. Her interiority feels more summarized than experienced, preventing a deeper connection.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, but her characterization lacks significant internal contradiction. While her emotional journey is dramatized through absorbing the sculpture's song, her purpose is never in doubt. The story presents a portrait of unwavering dedication rather than a crucible of choice, which limits the depth of conflict and change possible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation to "discover beauty" is established, but the shift from "hopeful melancholy" to "resolute acceptance" relies more on summary than embodied action. While his core intellectual struggle is clear, the final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, as when the narrative explains the covenant's meaning ("not sacrifice but acknowledgment") rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of that realization.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her final shift in purpose is earned by the story's discovery. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract, declarative statements ("Anger is sharp... Empathy is the bridge...") that border on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the embodiment of her unique philosophy into a lecture. The character reads as a coherent individual, but the lack of any real friction or self-doubt in her process makes the success feel preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear—ambition transforming into purpose—and her arc is coherent. However, her interiority relies on labels like "ambitious" and "persistent drive" rather than being fully embodied. The central concept of cultivating "serenity within motion" is asserted as an outcome rather than dramatized as a struggle; we are told her movements become more fluid, but we don't feel the initial friction or the cost of achieving that state.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arion's motivation is clear, but his characterization is thin. He is an archetype of competence who succeeds without facing a meaningful internal conflict or a choice between competing values. Interiority like "filled Arion with both dread and wonder" is a label rather than an embodied, contradictory experience, making his journey feel more like a procedural checklist than a personal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elena's motivation is clearly stated but feels more like an external label than an internal drive. Phrases like "determined to cultivate foresight in action" are repeated almost verbatim, functioning as thematic summaries rather than earned character traits. Her interiority is competent but lacks contradiction or embodied emotion; she is an observer whose thought processes are described with abstract labels ("rapidly adapting mind") rather than shown through struggle or specific, idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eira’s motivation is clear, but her characterization lacks depth. She functions more as a flawless vessel for a magical ritual than a person grappling with a heavy responsibility. The absence of any internal conflict, doubt, or a difficult micro-choice makes her feel one-dimensional; her movements are described as "untouched by mortal concerns," which prevents any meaningful sense of struggle or earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eldrin's motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal transformation relies too heavily on articulated self-awareness. The resolution feels more like a diagnosis than an embodied experience, particularly the line about tears "washing away months of accumulated guilt." The emotional arc is plausible but lacks the contradictory impulses and messy interiority of a truly high-stakes psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives her every action with cold precision. However, her interiority relies more on intellectual summary ("grand equation of feeling") than embodied conflict. The brief acknowledgment of her methods' unethical nature is rationalized away too quickly, blunting the potential for a deeper internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    Ayla's motivation is clear, but her primary trait, "jittery," is a label that doesn't meaningfully complicate her actions. The transformation to "confidence" is asserted in the final paragraph rather than earned through a crucible moment. This reliance on diagnostic self-awareness—"confidence replacing the jitters that had once defined her"—at the story's climax feels unearned and flattens the character's internal journey into a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, providing a strong engine for the narrative. The internal conflict between her mystical pursuits and her "firmly grounded" need for proof is established, though it reads more as a stated trait than a dramatized, contradictory impulse in the scene. The final change is earned by the story's events, but the shift from intellectual seeker to someone whose "certainty waver[s]" could be embodied with more granular texture rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization is thin; she functions more as a passive vessel for the plot than an individual with complex interiority. Her sacrifices are accepted without the embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses expected for this level of fiction. The final transformation into a "weaver of sound" feels asserted rather than earned through a visible character shift.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orion's motivation to find purpose is clear and his arc from meek to quietly authoritative is well-defined. However, his internal conflict during the pivotal trade is summarized with abstract phrasing like "this timeless moment between knowing and not knowing" rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in-scene. The character change feels more like a logical outcome of the plot than a deeply felt internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's engine. However, the interiority relies on summary and abstract labels at key moments, such as "Their motivation crystallized" and the final "determination burned brighter." These moments tell us about the character's change rather than embodying the contradictory feelings or the specific internal struggle that would make the final resolve feel more earned and less like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's transformation from reticent observer to active participant is well-earned. The motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in his long-standing duty. However, the internal state is occasionally summarized with diagnostic labels ("the luminescent ache of loneliness and kinship washed over him") instead of being purely embodied, which slightly softens the impact of his otherwise compelling internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her core internal conflict is powerfully encapsulated in the recurring phrase "shadowed elation." This contradiction—joy in her power weighed against the responsibility and uncertainty of it—gives her depth. The final beat, where she accepts her expanded role, feels earned. The only minor weakness is that her worry is stated more than it is shown to actively impede or alter her actions in a contradictory way mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his renewed perception post-surgery. His interiority is rich, but the final epiphany feels more like a cleanly articulated thesis than a messy, embodied realization. The line "people magnetize stories not through volume or dramatics, but through..." is a form of diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undermines the emotional weight of the discovery by summarizing it too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Samuel’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and compelling for this length. The internal conflict between his mundane job and his esoteric quest is well-drawn, and his final shift in purpose feels earned by the climax. The desire "to discover what trees witness" is a powerful, particular engine for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The keeper's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is stated more than embodied; the shift from "scattered pieces" to "alignment" is a summary of change rather than a dramatized internal conflict. The character serves their function flawlessly but lacks the contradictory impulses or specific flaws that create a truly memorable individual.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's core contradiction is clear, but her resolution feels more like a summarized therapeutic insight than an earned, embodied epiphany. Phrases like "understanding that her compassionate nature could exist alongside her reclusive tendencies" read as diagnostic label-speak, flattening the emotional climax into a tidy intellectual conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eliza's motivation is clear, but her climactic emotional shift feels asserted rather than earned. The sudden introduction of a specific past guilt ("about not having spoken up years earlier") in the same moment as its resolution ("a tenuous absolution") lacks the necessary groundwork, reading as a diagnostic label. This undercuts the credibility of her internal change, making the final state feel more like a summary of an arc than a dramatized one.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear but stated too explicitly and repeatedly ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"). The character is presented as perfectly suited for his task, lacking any internal conflict or contradictory impulses that would create dramatic tension. His "gently meticulous" nature is a label that enables a smooth success rather than a trait with trade-offs or costs, making him feel more like a function of the plot than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliza's motivation is strikingly original and consistent, but its abstract nature feels more asserted than deeply embodied. While her actions are logical extensions of this strange goal, the interiority lacks a visceral sense of *why* this arcane pursuit is so compelling beyond a brief mention of her father. The character reads as highly competent, but a moment of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse beyond tactical calculation would have deepened the portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's central arc from skepticism to acceptance is well-earned and provides a strong spine for the narrative. The internal conflict is clear and culminates in a decisive choice with a felt cost—the renunciation of a former self. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "futuristic nostalgia" and "natural skepticism warring with sensory evidence," which summarize the emotional state rather than fully embodying it through specific, contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is present, but the interiority relies on abstract labels ("auroral sorrow," "luminous regret") and overly diagnostic statements. The line "The broken combination lock of his creativity had been in plain sight all along" reads more like a summary than an embodied realization, slightly undermining the emotional authenticity of his breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, compelling, and beautifully tied to her unique attribute. Her internal state of ostracized longing effectively drives the narrative toward a decisive choice. The final realization feels slightly over-articulated, shifting from embodied interiority to a thematic summary, which prevents it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara is an archetype, not a character. Her motivation is a static, saintly devotion that is never tested, and she exhibits no flaws, contradictory impulses, or internal conflict. The story summarizes her feelings ("inspiration struck") rather than embodying them, rendering her a passive vessel for the story's admittedly beautiful concept. A character must be forged in a crucible of difficult choices, but here there is no heat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The android's motivation is compelling, rooted in a well-established internal conflict between its programming and its emergent "organic" nature. The final choice to sacrifice its singular form is earned and carries a visible cost. However, the internal state is occasionally described with repeating labels ("strangely organic," "inner static") rather than being fully embodied in its perception or micro-choices leading up to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's motivation is clear but his characterization lacks depth; he functions more as an observant catalyst than a protagonist with compelling internal conflict. His interiority is conveyed through summary ("The locked mailbox mystery began to consume his thoughts") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. While consistent, he remains a somewhat generic "good man" figure, a lens for the community's story rather than its complex heart.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority often relies on labels like "calm defiance" rather than embodied emotion. Her core philosophy is articulated in dialogue that functions as a thematic statement ("Sometimes the most vulnerable systems..."), which feels more like an authorial explanation than a character's organic expression in a moment of discovery. The revelation that the data is her own childhood language is a powerful character beat, but its emotional impact is somewhat flattened by the immediate shift to explaining the theme to the AI.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, driving every action from the ritualistic coffee preparation to the final act of digging. The shift from a seeker of lost memories to a keeper of preserved ones represents a mature, earned character change. The choice to rebury the crystal, accepting she can only visit and not retrieve, demonstrates a profound shift in her understanding of loss, a poignant renunciation that feels entirely earned by the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The summoner's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained. However, the characterization lacks depth; his interiority is articulated through competent, declarative statements ("Transformation was the action he sought...") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or struggle. He reads as a flawless executor of a plan, which lessens the feeling of genuine risk and makes him more of a vessel for the ritual than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characters operate as well-executed archetypes—the curious seeker and the wise mentor—without delving into deeper internal contradiction. The "mysterious familiarity" is resolved with a plot device (shared bloodline) rather than an earned emotional bond built through on-page conflict. The result is a characterization that is charming and effective but lacks the complexity needed for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her core internal conflict—the "charmed skepticism"—is resolved by assertion rather than dramatized struggle. Her character is defined by labels like "tragically radiant" and "ghostly resolve" that are explained thematically rather than embodied through nuanced action or contradictory impulses. The shift in her worldview feels too swift and tidy for a deeply ingrained trait.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation for redemption is clear, but his interiority relies on stock phrasing ("chains of guilt") and overly diagnostic self-awareness ("he needed to forgive the unfinished business of his betrayal"). The climactic choice is earned by the setup, but the internal conflict feels more summarized than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The character is functional and consistent, but lacks the particularity and embodied emotion required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and undergoes a legible shift, which is a strength. However, her character is conveyed through summary and labels ("richly perceptive," "reed-blown melancholy") rather than embodied experience. The crucial internal war between duty and curiosity is stated directly, not dramatized through a difficult choice, which flattens the emotional core of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure" is clear and consistent, effectively bookending the narrative. However, her interiority lacks texture; the critical choice to "weave truth carefully" is presented as a solved problem rather than a dramatized internal conflict with palpable risk. The character reads as a highly competent functionary for the plot, but her personal struggle or any contradictory impulses remain unexplored, limiting emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character is consistent and his motivations are clear, but his interiority feels more narrated than embodied. Phrases like "His demeanor was scintillatingly somber" and the direct statement of his philosophical conclusion ("he had concluded that the universe desired balance") read as authorial summary. This creates a distance, portraying a finished philosophical state rather than showing a mind in the process of discovery or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and her arc from debunker to protector is well-defined. However, her interiority relies on the repeated label "sharply observant" rather than being consistently embodied in her perceptions. The final shift to hope feels more like a thematic declaration than an earned, personal emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, a powerful anchor for the story. However, he is a character of endurance rather than change. The narrative confirms his pre-existing worldview without forcing him into a crucible where his convictions are tested through a difficult choice; he remains a brilliant but static portrait. His acceptance of the rising prophet is philosophically neat but dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving all his actions. However, his interiority lacks significant contradiction; he moves from a state of gentle purpose to fulfilled purpose without a moment of genuine doubt, struggle, or a difficult trade-off on the page. His characterization is evocative but feels more like a beautifully rendered archetype than a person with sharp, individual flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. However, the core internal conflict is delivered via a diagnostic label, "logically emotional," which is asserted rather than fully dramatized. While the story shows him using both logic (engineering) and feeling (duty), the trait itself reads more like an authorial tag than a deeply embodied, contradictory state experienced by the character in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mapper’s motivation is clear and consistent, but their interiority is more declarative than embodied. We are told they are “sculpting patience from impatience,” but we don't witness any genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. The character reads as a steadfast, almost symbolic figure, which serves the theme but limits their psychological depth and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and connects her professional duty to a personal rebellion, which effectively drives the final choice. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "fortified vulnerability" and "entangled memories" which summarize her state rather than embodying it in specific, contradictory impulses within the scene. The shift to "courage" feels more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Father Michael's motivation is clear and deepens effectively from a simple repair job to a complex moral reckoning. The internal conflict is well-staged. However, the characterization is slightly weakened when both he and Ms. Eleanor articulate the story's themes too directly, as when he explains the heart "represented how our broken hearts can be mended," making them feel more like conduits for the message than individuals arriving at a difficult conclusion organically.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    The glider's motivation is clear but lacks depth, reading more as a programmed directive than a complex drive. Character is established through repeated labels like "yearning algorithm" and "steadily curious nature" rather than through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The line "reverence tempered by irreverence" promises complexity, but this is not dramatized in the glider's choices, which follow a linear, untroubled path to the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core trait of being “brightly attentive” is demonstrated through action, not just stated. However, her interiority relies on summary and conceptual labels (“feeling the static electricity of forbidden knowledge,” “realization dawned with chilling clarity”) rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The character serves the plot capably, but lacks the specific, flawed humanity that would make her final choice feel more costly and complex.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on external labels ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "courageous anomaly") rather than earned, contradictory interiority. The core motivation, "to map empathy onto action," is a diagnostic, abstract phrase that reads like a thesis statement, flattening the character's internal experience into a concept. While her actions are consistent, she lacks the specific, flawed humanity expected for this tier, functioning more as a competent archetype executing a task.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is established, but the resolution feels overly articulated. The epiphany is expressed in diagnostic language ("a transformation—a becoming") rather than a more raw, embodied realization, which slightly undermines the emotional weight of her change. Marcus serves his role as a catalyst effectively, though his wisdom feels perfectly timed for the narrative's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    The sentinel's motivation is clear but his interiority is articulated in abstract, diagnostic language ("intersubjective understanding," "destined mismatches") that feels more like a thematic summary than an embodied emotional state. While consistent, he functions more as an archetype or a vessel for the story's thesis than a complex individual. His emotions are labeled ("frustration and acceptance") rather than shown through concrete perception or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line walker's motivation is clear and consistent, but characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is functional, serving the ritual's needs rather than exploring genuine conflict. The single moment of acknowledged cost—"continuity with the past meant isolation in the present"—is stated rather than dramatized, reading more like a diagnostic label than an embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels like "perceptively calm" and "earnest whimsy" rather than demonstrating these traits through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her interiority is functional but lacks a specific, flawed texture; she serves more as a serene facilitator for the theme than a complex individual grappling with the weight of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scholar's motivation is clear and deepens effectively from curiosity to sacred duty. However, the characterization relies too heavily on telling the reader about his core trait—"weathered innocence"—rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory actions. While his internal shift at the end is significant, his interiority often reads as a series of abstract epiphanies rather than a granular, lived experience, slightly flattening his presence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prophet's characterization is strong, anchored by the compelling internal conflict between his desire to find the sound and his nature to forget it. This contradiction is dramatized effectively in the climax ("The precognitively forgetful part of him wanted to turn away... But the junkyard prophet in him knew..."). The motivation is clear and specific, lending the archetypal character a memorable particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a well-established internal "ache" for transcendence. Her interiority is specific, though it occasionally relies on abstract labels like "metaphysics." The contrast between her quiet, intuitive approach and the head astronomer's brute-force suggestion effectively reveals her character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The therapist's motivation is clear, but her interiority verges on diagnostic self-awareness. Lines like "I understand now why this piece of vinyl matters" and the closing reflection on being "decisively kind" feel more like thematic summaries than embodied thought under pressure. While the character is consistent, she lacks a compelling internal contradiction in the scene, reading more as a serene guide than a participant grappling with the moment's difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot. However, interiority relies too heavily on labels like "determination" and "urgency" rather than embodied experience. The final transformation feels more stated than earned in the moment, a summary of change rather than a dramatized shift in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her core conflict as a "forgiving skeptic" is well-dramatized through her actions. The characterization is strong, showing her internal contradictions without relying on summary until the end. However, the final dialogue exchange where Arthur perfectly mirrors her internal thematic realization ("turning mistakes into constellations") feels too convenient, slightly undermining the earned complexity of both characters in that climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistently clear and her final emotional state is earned. However, the internal conflict between "wistful and determined" is more stated than dramatized as a simultaneous, contradictory pressure. The emotional progression feels slightly too smooth, culminating in a "perfect sphere of calm" that sidesteps the messier aspects of renouncing a lifelong dream.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic labels like "quietly proactive" and "protected vulnerability." This abstracts her emotional state rather than embodying it. The story tells us she is healing in stages, but we see a summary of the process, not the contradictory impulses of a mind under stress, which flattens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The novelist's internal conflict is clear and serves as the story's engine. His motivation is consistent and deepens by the end, culminating in a credible change from "conflicted" to "peace." However, the interiority occasionally leans on abstract, declarative statements ("the very essence of human resilience and connection") rather than fully embodying the conflict in a contradictory micro-choice, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and drives the plot, but her characterization remains archetypal. She is presented as a "whimsical tinkerer" but acts with frictionless competence, showing no internal conflict, doubt, or meaningful struggle. The resolution is achieved without a visible cost to her, making her journey feel more like a task completed than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains archetypal. There is no internal conflict, contradiction, or flaw; the alchemist is a perfect instrument for the task. Embodiment is functional ("fingers trembling... with reverence"), but the character lacks a specific, individual interiority, reading more as a symbol than a person. The competence is established, but there's no sense of a struggle overcome, only a process perfectly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent with her trade, but her characterization lacks compelling internal conflict. She proceeds with a placid competence that lessens the sense of struggle; her success feels preordained by her inherent nature rather than earned through overcoming internal doubt or missteps. The result is a character who serves the theme perfectly but feels more like a fable archetype than a flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The weaver's motivation is clear and consistent, and their internal conflict over being "boundary-lessly trapped" provides a strong core. The final change to seeing their calling as a gift is earned through the accumulative weight of the ceremony, particularly the vision from the final burden. However, the internal contradiction feels more stated than viscerally dramatized in-scene before the final epiphany, which lands a little too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Clara’s "hauntingly practical" nature is not just a label but a demonstrated worldview that motivates her actions, from measuring cage distances to carving her grief into a tangible object. The internal conflict is rendered with immense specificity, contrasting her past with her present and culminating in an earned change—not a simple resolution, but a complex, sustainable stance of "holding differently."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cyrus's motivation is sharp and consistent, driving the narrative from the initial search to the final confrontation. His internal state of regret and desperation is well-established. However, the final shift in both Cyrus ("newfound determination") and his ghost (from "bitter resentment to quiet recognition") is somewhat summarized and abrupt, lacking the embodied, contradictory process expected at the highest level of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels like "functionally creative" and "stoic determination" rather than earned, embodied emotion. There's little internal conflict or sense of genuine struggle; she competently executes a difficult task without hesitation or a moment of doubt. The character works as a vessel for the theme but lacks the specificity and contradiction of a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between regret and yearning is well-established. The character arc from defeated scribe to hopeful maker is legible and earned. However, the bear's anthropomorphic "knowing look" and "nod" feel overly convenient, simplifying the emotional complexity of his epiphany into an external, almost didactic nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority reads as overly articulate and diagnostic. Phrases like "serene upheaval" and "a calm certainty" label the emotional state rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory impulses in the scene. The character arc is a logical progression to an epiphany, but it lacks the friction of a genuine internal struggle or a costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, and his defining trait—patience—is demonstrated through action rather than just stated, which is a strength. However, both the seed collector and the fisherman read as well-executed archetypes rather than unique individuals. The internal experience, particularly the "thrill of understanding," is labeled rather than embodied, softening the impact of the climactic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The traveler’s motivation and arc are clear and compelling, but the interiority occasionally lapses into overly diagnostic self-awareness. Lines like "His projection of presence had become a defense against being truly present with himself" feel more like an authorial summary of his psychology than an organic, in-the-moment thought, slightly flattening the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prince's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on generic phrasing ("motivation burned within him," "bitter sweetness") rather than a specific, embodied perspective. The final epiphany is stated directly in diagnostic language ("Elorian understood that...") which undermines the emotional weight of the moment by summarizing the lesson instead of letting the character live it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's core motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in the compelling paradox of her identity. However, her interiority occasionally leans into over-articulated self-awareness, stating her motivations and beliefs directly (e.g., "symbolizing her belief that beauty could adapt and survive"). This tendency to summarize her internal state, particularly the recurring "scars can sing" motif, lessens the impact of her embodied choices, which are otherwise strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") rather than demonstrated, contradictory impulses. Her skepticism falters momentarily but presents no real obstacle or internal conflict that forces a difficult choice. She functions more as a competent, idealized vessel for the plot's mystical requirements than a character with tangible flaws or a complex interior life under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but the interiority remains abstract and conceptual. The being reads more as a personified ideal than a flawed, particular individual, with emotions described ("troubling serenity") rather than fully embodied. While this suits the otherworldly nature, it limits deep characterization and relies on a state of being rather than contradictory impulses acting in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a well-realized character whose motivation is clear and consistent. His interiority is specific, particularly the concept of "thundering calm," which avoids cliché. The backstory of his spectral mentor is integrated effectively, driving his present actions. The primary limitation is a lack of significant internal contradiction during the main action; once he decides to walk, his path to insight feels smooth and inevitable rather than a struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Alaric’s motivation and arc are clear, but his interiority is overly articulate and diagnostic. The moment of realization reads more like an authorial summary than an embodied epiphany ("Alaric understood now—his meticulous winding had been correct in principle but wrong in practice"). While the emotional change is earned by the plot, the internal processing feels too tidy and self-aware for a moment of genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but the core trait of "blithe" feels asserted rather than dramatized within the core scene. It acts as a bookend label ("blithe cemetery gardener") rather than an active, contradictory impulse shaping his choices in the silo. The internal shift is earned through his actions, but the characterization lacks the friction of a truly integrated internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong anchor for the narrative. However, her interiority often relies on summary rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "Her groundedly imaginative nature had been forged through failures" explain her character traits directly instead of dramatizing them through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, epitomized by the potent goal "to teach dust to tell stories." Her "thistled calm" demeanor provides a nice contrast between her internal resolve and external quietness. However, the characterization remains more of a resolute portrait than a dramatized struggle; she faces no on-page moment of doubt or a choice between competing values, which keeps the portrayal strong but stops it short of exceptional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena's motivation is clear, but her interiority often relies on summary ("etched with sorrow and determination") rather than embodied emotion. While her profession is fascinating, the internal conflict between her desire for safety and her acceptance of flux feels more explained than dramatized until the final moments. The character is consistent, but a touch too self-aware and articulate about her own psychological state.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Milo's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his philosophical principles. The internal conflict between the Council's dogma and the evidence of the cog is well-drawn. However, the characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels like "rationally rebellious" and "abrasive calm," which are asserted more than they are fully embodied in contradictory, in-scene actions or choices. His calmness is evident, but the "abrasive" quality remains an abstract trait.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, and her arc from "expectantly resigned" to "hopeful determination" provides a satisfying frame. However, her characterization relies heavily on summary and thematic labels rather than embodied emotion in a crucible scene. Contradictory impulses are absent; she reads as an idealized archetype whose philosophy is never truly tested by a specific, dramatized challenge, making her transformation feel more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a consistent and functional character, but he serves more as a vessel for the story's theme than as a complex individual. His motivation is clear, but interiority occasionally relies on diagnostic labels like "informally wise" or clinical explanations for his ability. This telling, rather than showing, keeps the characterization from achieving top-tier depth and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is a repeated thematic label ("preserve wonder in routine") rather than an embodied drive tested by choices. The maintenance supervisor's characterization is delivered entirely via a block of expository thought from Elara, which flattens the reveal into a summary. His on-page dialogue is a direct thesis statement ("I meant only to pause the world..."), representing a missed opportunity for nuanced character work under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly her sensitivity to "creeping normalities." The character is consistent, and her final shift to understanding is earned through her ritualistic actions. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless, with her path forward becoming "clear" without a more deeply felt or contradictory emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The diver's characterization is functional but lacks depth; their internal conflict between academic belief and new knowledge is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The statue is an effective thematic device but reads more as a wise oracle than a character with internal complexity or meaningful limitations. The diver's final change feels more like an intellectual acceptance than a deeply earned, embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to escape his self-inflicted purgatory is clear and compelling. His defining traits, "grim optimism" and "balancedly daring nature," are consistently demonstrated through his methodical work on the proofs. However, the repeated self-labeling of these traits feels slightly declarative rather than purely shown, preventing the characterization from achieving truly exceptional subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The painter’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She is "methodically hopeful" and remains so, her hope simply "vindicated" at the end without a moment of genuine doubt or a contradictory impulse being tested on the page. While her dedication is well-portrayed, she functions more as a flawless conduit for the story's theme than a complex individual whose flaws complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong. The guide's motivation as a "historically oriented ache" is specific and compelling, driving his shift from observer to participant. Khira is a powerful secondary character, her defiance embodied in the physical act of kneading ("her face lined with 决心," "The bread remembers"). The story successfully portrays their established ritual and the pivotal moment it changes, revealing their values through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Esme’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent with her character concept. However, the interiority feels more declarative than embodied; lines like "time was not a river... but a choice" function as thematic statements rather than lived, contradictory emotional experience. The character serves the high concept perfectly but lacks the deeper internal conflict that would elevate her beyond a vehicle for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the interiority relies on abstract declarations like "the meaning settled within me" rather than embodied emotion. While the reveal of the advisor as a future self is a strong beat, the character's internal conflict reads more as a philosophical exercise than a visceral struggle, particularly when using quasi-diagnostic language like "unbosom the part of you that fears death the most."

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prophet is a consistent and functional archetype, but lacks the depth expected for top-tier fiction. Her motivation is clear and her actions align with it, but there is no internal conflict, flaw, or genuine struggle; she is a figure of serene competence. The story misses the opportunity to show contradictory impulses, instead presenting a character who has already achieved perfect harmony with her purpose, which limits emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, the final emotional shift from "dread" to "purpose" is articulated through summary rather than embodied in a specific, contradictory internal experience. The line "it had transformed into something resembling purpose" is a label for the change, not the change itself, which slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise strong arc.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization is functional but lacks depth. Dr. Voss is defined by a label—"emotionally rational"—rather than through conflicting impulses or difficult choices. Her motivation is clear but never tested, making her feel more like a narrative device for uncovering the plot than a person grappling with the weight of history. The absence of any internal struggle or flaw results in a flat, overly competent protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent with his actions. However, the core trait of "stoically sensitive" is presented more as a declarative label than a dynamic, internal conflict tested by the scene's pressures, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deepens effectively from professional to personal. His defining traits ("logical," "tranquilly perceptive") are consistently applied, leading to the central discovery. However, these traits often feel more like labels asserted by the narration than qualities fully embodied through nuanced action or contradictory impulse, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lantern maker's motivation is singular and clear, but his interiority relies on abstract labels ("bereft," "luminous torment") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses in the moment. While his actions are consistent, his internal state is summarized with a high degree of self-awareness that feels more like a diagnosis than an experience. The final change is earned within the story's logic, but the path there lacks the grit of a truly messy internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and potent, directly rooted in his traumatic backstory. His internal state is consistently portrayed through the "bleak exhilaration," a strong emotional anchor. However, the reliance on labeling this feeling, rather than purely embodying it through perception and action, slightly flattens the interiority. The final shift from survivor to purposeful harvester feels earned, but the transition itself lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation is singular and drives the plot, but her characterization relies on labels rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. The repeated attribute "perpetually surprised" is asserted three times but never constrains a choice or reveals a deeper internal conflict; it functions as a tic, not a trait. The final shift is an epiphany, a moment of understanding, rather than a costly choice born from a crucible of internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's motivation is compelling and drives the narrative effectively. His internal conflict, born from his profession, is palpable and the final emotional release feels earned. However, the interiority occasionally veers into diagnostic language, particularly in the final beats (e.g., "understood what he had been quelling all these years—the knowledge that..."), which slightly summarizes the emotional state rather than fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority suffers from diagnostic self-awareness. Lines like "she was known as uncommonly thoughtful" and her final realization that her approach "was for everyone involved" feel more like an author's summary than an in-the-moment thought. The character's actions are strong, particularly the use of the drawer pull, but the internal voice over-articulates the story's themes, reducing the sense of genuine, messy emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elena’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and consistent. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of diagnostic self-awareness, such as her thought about "learning to align heart and action," which feels more like a thematic summary than an organic, in-the-moment realization. The emotional shift prompted by the dolphins is borderline convenient, relying on telling the reader "something shifted inside her" rather than fully embodying the change through action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation to solve the immediate puzzle is clear and compelling. However, the shift from "clean slate seeker" to accepting his fate as the "time traveler" in a perpetual loop feels more like an intellectual realization than a deeply felt emotional turn. The interiority is functional, with some nice phrasing ("water in my chest"), but the character's reaction to the profound climax is somewhat muted, making him feel more like a component of the plot mechanism than a fully embodied person confronting an earth-shattering truth.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire plot. However, her interiority occasionally relies on telling over showing, particularly the fear of metamorphosis, which is stated ("terrified her") rather than fully embodied. The final emotional state feels slightly summarized ("transformed yet fundamentally unchanged"), softening the impact of her profound experience.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    The cartomancer's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in the specific anxieties of new motherhood. Her interiority, however, sometimes slips into over-articulated, diagnostic language ("This was her repentance—to accept that..."). While the emotional arc is earned, the expression of her final understanding feels more like a summary than a deeply embodied, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a well-defined pacifist philosophy that drives the entire narrative. The emotional progression from resolve to joy is earned.

    The poet's motivation to rebuild the library as resistance is clear and rooted in his molting personalities and past with Elias, intensifying through embodied actions like scattering seeds; however, internal conflicts feel more summarized than simultaneous in scene, with emotions leaning toward poetic abstraction rather than contradictory embodiment. The final endurance forecloses paths with felt costs of fragmentation, but flaws like stock phrasing in reflections limit depth. A key strength is the hierarchy of values revealed in micro-choices, such as tracing the tin's bottom during molts.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pianist's motivation is clear and rooted in his daughter's death, intensifying through strategic actions like modifying the projector, with embodied longing shown in his performance; however, interior contradictions are more summarized than simultaneous in scene, slightly softening peak pressure. The broken clock as a crucible object reveals his values under stress, culminating in an earned endurance that accepts time's cost. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, but emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution in the liminal space.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in Elara's role as reality checker, compelling her to act before the monsoon with the seed, but interiority relies on stock summaries like "feeling the weight of generations" without deeply embodied contradictory impulses in scene. The empirically whimsical trait is labeled rather than shown constraining choices, though her dream interpretation and singing under doubt reveal a hierarchy of values with some cost. Final endurance feels earned by prior steps, but emotions layer with mild hypocrisy rather than sharp irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor's motivation to resolve cerulean regret is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses of patience versus urgency shown in his ritual actions; emotions are concretely felt in trembling hands and confessions, aligning with micro-choices like touching bonsai branches. Flaws complicate his quest without hedging, as unexpressed words manifest physically, earning the final renunciation of sorrow with visible emotional cost. No second character is present, so relationship bullets are ignored; the single-POV interiority is character-specific and degrades appropriately under reflective stress.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s arc is honest—her gradual shift from cosmic detachment to humble witness is embodied through micro-choices like photographing seedlings and saving a single wing dust—but her prior astro-work is summarized more than dramatized, limiting interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s interiority is embodied (trembling hands, spiral epiphany) and her adaptive trait drives the frost-plate experiment, but the shift from passive survivor to active exposer is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve feels slightly pre-packaged.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her embodied grief, tactile handling of the fork, and micro-choice to “map the emotional heat patterns” all feel specific. Yet the trauma of capsizing and deafness is summarized rather than dramatized mid-scene, blurring the cost that should sharpen her final resolve. The arc from survivor to composer lands, but the contradiction between past helplessness and present mastery is asserted more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, the “weight of all the souls” he’s buried—but the shift from undertaker to keeper feels slightly abstract; the cost of this transformation is asserted rather than embodied. His stubbornness is named, not dramatized in a moment of costly choice. Still, the final image of sanctuary among the waves gives him a credible new identity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motives (preserve community identity) are clear and consistent, but interiority stays general; we see no contradictory impulse under pressure. His final declaration is credible yet lacks embodied cost—the bell is handed down, not wrested from him. Mira and the teens remain functional extensions rather than crucibles. Still, the intergenerational bond feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “unused love” motive remains abstract; the climactic breath-choice is credible yet the cost feels soft. Secondary characters are off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. No contradictory impulses shown mid-scene; epiphany is gently earned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“fingers tracing,” “terrifying yet intoxicating”), but her motives—curiosity about time’s texture—are stated more than dramatized. The final choice to merge with the garden is abrupt; prior beats don’t foreshadow such total surrender, so the cost feels under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied, but interiority flirts with label-speak (“patiently strategic”) and the chains never physically constrain her choices; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—he can restore others’ hearing yet cannot hear betrayal—is embodied and specific. The cancer diagnosis is mentioned only as a ticking clock, not used to alter tactics; the final renunciation (burying the prototype) is earned by the prior obsession, but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lillian’s contradictory impulses—thief vs. historian—surface in real time when she re-aims the moonbeam jar toward her portraits; the turn from stealing to preserving is embodied, not proclaimed. Minor slippage: “destiny’s door” is abstract and unearned in a single reflection beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but his contradictory impulses remain mostly narrated rather than dramatized in micro-choice; the bookmark and thawing heart are externalized symbols rather than internal drivers of decision. The final “we thaw” lands as a gentle renunciation, yet the cost feels diffuse because the stakes were never sharply personalized.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s claustrophobia and cleithrophobia are embodied in her crouch and breathing techniques; the seashell’s warmth and whisper anchor her contradictory impulses. The betrayal revelation is dramatized through the shell’s voice and the plaster cast, not exposition. Final stance—choosing vulnerability over stunt bravado—earns its cost in the charged poise of facing the silhouettes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Oracle's embodied stillness and tactile ritual with the booklet and pebbles anchor her interiority; her shift from mild obsession to violent determination is legible in the final beat ("she smiled"), yet the absence of any second on-page character or concrete status dynamic keeps relationships from becoming crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit 347’s interior contradiction—protocol vs curiosity—is dramatized in the single decisive touch of the violin; the cost (loss of external directives, gain of internal harmonies) is visible. Yet the “existential processors” phrase edges into diagnostic label-speak, blunting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior contradiction between yearning for transparency and fearing misuse of the lens is embodied when she chooses to leave it behind, suffering a visible forfeiture of easy communion; the earned renunciation aligns with prior causality, but some beats lean on stock labels like “desire to thaw mistrust” rather than embodied need.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his ritual with the marbles, his bodily frailty, and his quiet defiance of quantification all feel lived-in. Yet the apprentice’s off-stage voice never applies pressure, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is moot and the final stance crystallizes without visible interpersonal cost. The earned stasis is credible but leans summary rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“mechanically warm fingers”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final “subdued awakening of purpose” is asserted rather than earned through visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “familiar pull toward the space that existed in between” anchors motive—but the ghost remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Micro-choices (lifting the program, choosing to play) are embodied and escalate stakes. Final renunciation—program dissolves, silence transfigured—earns cost, though the ghost’s absence limits contradiction depth.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fever, snow on the floor, the leaden stomach—but the “swallowed truth” remains abstract, blunting the final choice. His fault-tolerance is asserted rather than dramatized; no moment shows him functioning despite missing data. The smudging micro-choice is concrete and stakes-revealing, yet the cost of walking into the night feels more atmospheric than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    Marcus’s “find the weight” drive is clear, interiority is tactile, but the final choice is passively received knowledge rather than an active renunciation; the cost feels post-hoc rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“grip on reality, always loose, loosened further”—and the final refusal of stasis is earned by prior causality. Yet the character’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene, and the cost of resisting the silence is only implied, not felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory of the locket, her childhood echo in Lila’s posture—but the moment she chooses to use the eclipse as therapy feels slightly convenient rather than compelled by flaw or contradiction. Lila’s first words arrive as earned release, yet the story hedges the cost by framing healing as gentle inevitability rather than risk-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    The historian’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts toward summary (“felt a sense of purpose that transcends”). Embodied emotion is sparse; most reactions are abstract (“smiled, a rare expression”). Micro-choices are present but not sharply contradictory; the final preservation act is earned yet low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Writer’s interiority is evocative but abstract; no contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Motivation (“transpose life into a new key”) is stated repeatedly yet never tested by an on-page choice that costs him anything. The absence of a second character removes relationship crucible pressure. Closure is a serene smile rather than an earned renunciation or decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Michael’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, embodied awe—but his contradictory impulses (faith vs. techno-heresy) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of volume for silence is earned, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Sarah remains a prop, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“exhaustion creeping…like a tide”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly alters tactics. The final collapse is earned by prior fatigue, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his hovering shame and wonder are embodied—but the “labyrinth of self” motivation is stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The climactic acceptance lands with felt cost, yet earlier beats lean on summary rather than micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor's interior contradictions—yearning to hear versus embracing tactile sound—are embodied and dramatized across beats. The broken needle evolves from salvage to reinvention, marking earned renunciation at closure: she accepts silence as her instrument. Reflection stays anchored in micro-decisions: choosing a record, spinning it backward, guiding students onto the floor. The cost—former identity abandoned—reads on page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—tracing the notebook, lateral movement, trembling fingers—yet interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“he would nurture integrity in solitude”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final decision to co-opt the pigeon is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (risk of exposure), satisfying the 9+ quick test despite some over-articulated self-admonition.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—trembling fingers, tears, the way he “breathed deeply” at the end—yet the epiphany that “it wasn’t the smells themselves” arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost. The grief-driven motivation is consistent, but the moment of renunciation (embracing rather than resisting memory) is asserted more than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete, the contradictions around time and ethical playfulness manifest in micro-choices with rope and notebook; the final moment of Earned Stasis (coiling rope with the map now internalized) lands with visible cost of abandoning external validation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his acoustic gift, the cracked bowl, the nightly stories—but the final choice to “unbind the silence” is more stated than dramatized; we see the family’s tears but not Kael’s internal contradiction or felt cost, so the change reads as affirmation rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; his “static electricity” gift is concrete. Motivation (fuse insight with empathy) is stated early and revisited, but the client remains a cipher, so relationship pressure is absent. The final smile shows earned stasis with cost—he locks away potent petals, acknowledging ethical limits. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the arc is more observation than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s “whimsically attentive” trait is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (remembering children’s names, calculating sponsorship angles). Interiority stays anchored in present stimuli; the locket’s reprise shows earned change. However, Eleanor’s interiority is thin, and the final beat leans summary rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s loneliness and yearning are embodied in tactile reed-work; her decisive carving of the sigil into the arbor shows earned change. Secondary characters remain functional rather than individuated, slightly limiting depth. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV interiority is vivid—gloved fingers on pendant, trembling hands—but motivation is declared rather than embodied; the “burned within him” line is summary. The final collapse shows cost, yet the choice to mortgage his lifespan feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s buried optimism and inventive nature are embodied in her nightly ritual, but the interior contradiction between hope and caution is stated more than dramatized; the mentor’s absence is motive yet never complicates her present tactics. Micro-choices (tracing patterns, packing the eyes) are present but low-stakes. Closure is a soft “renewed purpose” rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers trailing along cool pipes,” “smell of old books”), but the final renunciation—remaining hidden while guiding the tape to the surface—leans on summary rather than dramatized cost; the contradiction between lifelong invisibility and the need to be seen is stated more than enacted in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s arc—scientist shackled by control to partner who listens—lands and carries cost, yet her contradictory interior pulses are sometimes paraphrase-looped (“reluctant metamorphosis... sustaining transformation”). Micro-choice to open vents is earned; earlier refusal beats feel slightly summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (trembling hands, ghostly warmth), but her contradictory impulses (cling vs exchange) are summarized rather than dramatized in the moment of choice. The final renunciation is earned, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s shift from passive seer to active creator is dramatized through her tactile engagement with the pearl and the shadowed crystals; the embodied micro-choice to “reach out to touch” crystallizes the arc. Interiority remains concrete and character-specific, though the final beat of “everyday magic” flirts with label-speak. Motivation is rooted in her identity as clairvoyant and intensifies under pressure, but the pilgrim’s absence denies relationship-as-crucible pressure. Overall, a credible renunciation of foresight for participation, with visible cost in the loss of predictive certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elina is vivid as the tactile, sensory archivist—“her duty to compile fragments” is shown through the chest, diary, and valve—yet her internal conflict is less embodied; vision gifts feel like granted magical skill rather than dilemma until the final quiet renunciation. Micro-choice at 700 words—“she shared this with the returnees”—lands as earned stance with cost, yet earlier stakes are soft and “visions [that] flood her mind” remain narrated not bodily felt.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ethan’s meticulous nature is shown through concrete action (mapping cracks, noting mist-forms), but interior contradiction is muted; the “trembling certainty” is declared rather than embodied. Motivation crystallizes late yet feels consistent; the integration of the ticket punch as bodily extension supplies a visible cost that forecloses return to ordinary mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s skeptic-to-believer arc is legible and embodied in her tactile handling of the tile, but the interior contradiction between doubt and wonder is stated more than dramatized; the final choice to open the tower feels earned yet slightly abstract, lacking a single on-page moment where the cost of that openness is viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alistair’s immortal ennui and sudden hunger for purpose register with visceral embodied beats (“pulsing against his skin,” “hushed thunder”). Micro-choices (brushing dust, aligning magnetic vectors) chart a credible arc from boredom to guardian stance, capped by embodied cost (“stepped through…escondite collapsing”)

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—honest child of a con artist—drives every beat; the ink pot’s reprise at the end crystallizes her earned stance. Micro-choices (duplicating the key, steadying her hand with the pot) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is felt: she forfeits job security and employer trust. Only slight reserve: the “mathematics of fair trade” is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias embodies the solitary scholar-caretaker archetype with specificity—ink-stained, gold-leaf fingertips, tactile memory work—yet interiority occasionally leans diagnostic rather than embodied. His dedication to invented histories fuels every action; the climactic triad of dawn notations earns a visible, felt price. Flawed, locked-in purpose is credible and scales to scope.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied ("ghost with flesh that hungers"), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation of bureaucratic identity is earned yet stated more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Evelyn’s curiosity and myth-buster identity are consistently embodied in her tactile handling of objects and her choice to play the cello. The interior contradiction—desire for certainty vs. acceptance of ambiguity—surfaces only in the final paragraph, so the earned shift feels slightly compressed. Still, her micro-choices (picking up the shell, bowing the strings) align with motive and foreclose the path of pure debunking.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—tradition vs. survival—drives every beat; the graffiti-mapping nights and final choice to return the chip crystallize earned renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“clutched the foundation stone chip tighter”) grounds stakes without therapy-speak. Dual allegiance resolves through action, not summary. Minor slip: “reluctant conductor” leans label, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through micro-choices—adjusting camera settings, dissolving the grain, steadying her hand—yet interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“dawnlit melancholy settled deep in her bones”). The final endurance is earned, but the emotional layering feels slightly smoothed rather than contradictory under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s blindness is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing feathers, finding tools by memory) and the final renunciation—letting the drone go—carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “decode feedback into direction” motive is stated more than dramatized, muting contradiction. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elmsley’s obsession is vivid, but interiority drifts into summary (“he knew was scientific”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile feels earned, yet the cost of his discovery remains more intellectual than visceral. Micro-choices (adjusting the phrasebook, tracing condensation) anchor character, but stakes never truly threaten his identity or safety.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas’s interiority is spare but consistent; his embodied patience and sonic attunement are shown through tactile micro-choices. Yet we never glimpse contradictory impulses or private stakes—only serene resolve—so the “infinitely patient” label feels ornamental rather than tested. The final renunciation (leaving the restored town) is legible but unmotivated on the page; no felt cost is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—survival training vs. intuitive trust in the temple—are dramatized in real time; the final choice to override instinct and ascend with the vial is earned by prior embodied cost (burning lungs, sealed door). Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no therapy-speak. Flaws (reckless curiosity) actively complicate the choice and foreclose retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“hovering at the threshold… suspended in that liminal space”), but the son’s contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final “whisper the truth” is earned by pattern rather than a visible micro-choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bride’s contradictory drive—tethered here yet reaching for release—generates credible tension in every act: choosing to conserve seeds, transmitting them, dying again. Embodied emotion peaks when her fingers manage transparent lift. Motivation rooted in lifetime debt remains consistent, informs micro-choices, and culminates in self-sacrificial cost. Interiority remains vivid, though a few stock phrasings leech specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s haunting optimism is stated but never embodied in contradictory action; her sleepwalking is passive and the final “purpose” is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice. Interiority drifts into summary (“she knew she had found her purpose”) instead of concrete, embodied stakes. No visible cost is paid on the page for her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the trembling hands, the old tongue returning, the tears at closure all anchor his arc. Motivation intensifies cleanly from curiosity to purposeful restoration, culminating in the bird-piece placement that costs him exile’s weight. Minor slip: “warmly curious” is asserted rather than dramatized early on.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s contradiction—professional power vs. private longing—drives every beat; her final smile reconfiguring self-invention is earned and paid in surface-mail slowness, a Charged Poise that forecloses total anonymity with visible yearning cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her feigned foolishness and real acuity coexist in every stitch—but the final beat (“shrugged when praised”) is too compressed to register the full cost of her renunciation, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s fierce-tender motivation—finding the unspoken apology before it turns to permanent loss—drives every traversal under the mangroves, but her interiority occasionally drifts into reverie rather than concrete choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen's conflict-zone translator persona is vivid through small embodied gestures and child-trusted innocence, but the climactic act of helping Lina feels slightly generalized rather than sharpening his own flaw into the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Amelia’s interiority is vivid (“liquid dawn,” “pensive mirth”) and her arc from lost joy to communal rekindling is legible, but the shift feels externally granted by the fragment rather than wrested through contradictory impulses; no embodied cost is dramatized at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her “methodically playful” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (paint ratios, tracing cracks). The five nested awakenings, however, arrive as labeled epiphanies (“first awakening,” “second awakening”) rather than dramatized contradictions under pressure, blunting cost. The final renunciation—trading certainty for curiosity—earns resonance but feels slightly abstract because the nickel’s agency overshadows hers.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his half-smile and rumpled jacket anchor him—but the story leans on summary rather than embodied contradiction; the final “untaxed thought” lands as earned renunciation yet lacks a preceding micro-choice that visibly costs him.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Poet’s insomnia and “photosynthesize pain into beauty” motive are stated, not dramatized; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Final renunciation (to die awake so others dream) is asserted rather than earned through visible cost. Interiority drifts toward lyrical summary rather than specific, character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eleth’s interiority is lyrical but generic; “foxglove regret” and “shattered soul” read as ornamental rather than embodied contradiction. The single on-page choice—restoring the tube—aligns with motive yet lacks a visible cost that alters Eleth’s stance. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the caretaker’s emotions are stated, not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her “breath catching,” “fingers trembling with cautious exuberance”—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final walk to the chamber is the first micro-choice we actually witness. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the cost of her “carefully reckless” stance is asserted more than felt until the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the chain’s clink, the solvent’s scent—but the “encrypted compassion” epiphany arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, softening the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—burying the past yet mapping dust to resurrect it—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (balancing the meteorite, signing the letter). The final renunciation of her false identity carries visible cost: she releases the first pigeon and the old self simultaneously. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “Elara of the Flight Paths” edges toward label-speak, blunting the earned moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“featherly determination,” tracing wood grain), but the late appearance of her father dilutes the crucible effect; the final reunion feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned through visible cost on her side.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s yearning for “belonging” is embodied through tactile micro-choices—removing gloves, pressing palm to glass—and her tears register authentic cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “softly ingenious” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no visible mistake or limitation complicates her arc. The final renunciation (leaving with the map-feather) is earned, yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps her from full contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the recollectionist’s contradictory impulses—yearning to restore yet fearing the loss of memory—are palpable. However, her final epiphany arrives more as thematic summation than as a choice that visibly costs her something concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s motivation (“serenade monotony”) and interiority about pattern calculation remain consistent; feelings stay embodied in breathing rhythms and micro-gestures. The bishop token reprise at closure crystallizes Earned Stasis—he knowingly forfeits the piece’s private meaning for the stranger’s emotional cost. Secondary pressure outside the woman is only hinted, so full relational crucible isn’t activated, but within the single-POV frame Leo’s hierarchy of values surfaces under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation—to preserve memory against the ban—remains consistent, and her final anchoring is an earned renunciation. Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstraction (“cosmic verse on mortal skin”). The transformation is credible, yet the cost (immobility) is stated more than felt. Character reads as archetype rather than individual; specificity of voice and contradiction are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara's interior contradiction — fascination with the mundane vs. desire to share wonder — remains largely asserted, not dramatized; no moment forces a visible trade-off under pressure. The shift to “a new resolve” is thematic summary rather than embodied choice. Specific sensory handling earns credit, but the causal link between stone-throw epiphany and workshop return feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the firefighter’s contradictory impulses (guilt vs. need for meaning) are dramatized through micro-choices like tracing the fracture. The final stance—accepting the box as companion—earns its cost via prior causality. A hairline slip: “bargained innocence” is stated rather than fully dramatized in the fire scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s logic-dreaming is convincingly shown through micro-decisions in shaping the patterns, but internal contradictions are narrated more than dramatized mid-scene. Interiority is vivid yet lapses into clever explanation, and the earned change—while costly—leans symbolic more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and inherited duty are clear, but interiority stays at summary level; no moment of embodied contradiction under pressure. The final commitment is stated rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Painter’s interiority is vivid—her borrowed heartbeat pulses against the terrace stone—but her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. renunciation) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is foreshadowed yet feels slightly abstract because the cost is carried by the terrace, not visibly by her body.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s interiority is textured—thumb-polished wood, trembling hands—but the “price of redemption” remains abstract; no single micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. The lifelong solitude is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene, so the felt cost is attenuated.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—ruthless empire-builder vs. secret sentimentalist—are dramatized in the single act of kneeling to release the egg; the cost is the irreversible loss of his own creation and the public mask he wears. Interiority is specific (“chest tightening at birdsong silenced”) and embodied. The final smile is earned because earlier beats establish both his capacity for sentiment and the drought he authored. No slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “chaste courtesan” label is asserted more than dramatized; her clients’ off-stage conversions feel summarized rather than witnessed. The final step into the sanctuary is earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s serenity is stated repeatedly but never tested; no embodied contradiction or visible cost appears. The mentor conflict is off-stage, so interior stakes remain abstract. Micro-choices (packing puppets, calligraphy) are ritual, not crucible. Closure is a quiet nod rather than earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between preservation and impermanence is dramatized in the act of weaving knots that will dissolve. The final renunciation—accepting the transience of the memorial itself—carries visible cost in the line “tonight…one esoteric realist had woven a temporary structure.” Minor slip: the phrase “interrupted cadence of their own heartbeat” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears froze on her cheeks”), her guilt-to-purpose arc is credible, and the final renunciation (staying as keeper) carries visible cost. Yet the “technically gentle” trait is asserted more than dramatized in the braiding scene, and the forgiveness backstory is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but remains high-level; moments like “precisely playful” are told rather than dramatized in micro-choice, so the epiphany cost feels generalized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Anu’s frugality, faith-science tension, and embodied awe are vivid; the final covenant moment crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the “empirically ironic” label is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his resentment distorts the sanctuary’s air—but Elara’s “scheming pacifist” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; her manipulations remain off-stage, weakening the crucible. The cellular-memory beat gives Marcus a credible embodied shift, yet the brother’s sudden appearance feels unearned, blurring relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mirror maker’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands, tremor of age—but the “runaway dream” remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation (“I will not capture you”) is credible yet feels lightly earned because the dream never tests him. Micro-choices (breath-sync, polishing) are embodied and specific, but stakes stay conceptual rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven retreat vs. stubborn hope—are embodied in her sore fingers and quartz-eye ache; the ribbon’s reprise crystallizes her renunciation of despair. Micro-choices (planting the seed, watering with both tears) foreclose isolation with visible cost. Only the “endearingly feisty” label feels slightly external, not fully earned in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“weight of collapsing stars”), but the final choice to pursue forbidden knowledge is declared rather than dramatized; no micro-choice shows the cost on the page. Reflection is anchored in present action (bathroom insight) and tilts his stance, satisfying BRR. Flawed curiosity is consistent, yet the closing beat lacks a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (rescue a trapped scholar) is clear and personal, but interiority stays abstract—“her mind already calculating pathways” never becomes embodied choice. The single decisive act (renegotiating with guardians) is reported rather than dramatized, blurring cost. Competence feels unbalanced by struggle; no visible flaw complicates the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“homesick for lives she had never lived”), but her contradictory impulses remain stated rather than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes cleanly yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eleanor’s “warmly methodical” trait is embodied in the deliberate layout of tools and the careful braid reconfiguration, but interior contradiction is muted; her motive to “translate confusion into clarity” is stated more than dramatized. The final confrontation with Croft lands as earned stasis—she has crossed a boundary with irreversible cost implied by the merged timeline—yet the emotional price feels lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mapkeeper’s motivation—“to find the quiet in the storm”—is stated early and aligns with inherited duty, but interiority stays on the declarative level. No contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene; choices feel predetermined. The earned change is foreshadowed more than lived, so cost registers as symbolic rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s retrocognitive gift is shown in action—charting stars from ancestral memory—but her interior contradiction (hope vs. burden) is stated more than dramatized. The final climb and alignment carry embodied cost (trembling hands, dawn fatigue), earning the renunciation of permanent restoration. Yet the “thistle-blown hope” label feels externally applied rather than wrung from her body.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elthion’s interiority is textured and embodied, but his decisive moment—“I will capture what we have been”—arrives more as declaration than dramatized choice; the preemptive nostalgia trait is shown early yet never visibly constrains or alters his tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “serious playfulness” and tactile handling of the rag knot ground him—but the shift from passive observer to active agent is abrupt; the mosaic note feels like an external prompt rather than an earned pivot. The final smile registers as earned stasis, yet the cost (fatigue, doubt, exposure) is only implied, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s interiority is textured—her hand on the cicada, the warmth “pulsing as if alive” anchors contradiction between fear and resolve. Yet the shift from funding panic to cosmic insight feels slightly epiphanic rather than earned; the cost of her new stance is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and silence-tasting obsession are vivid and embodied, but the final beat of “heal her relationship to the earth” is asserted rather than dramatized; the porcelain doll’s emotional weight is set up yet never re-encountered after liftoff, leaving the interior arc slightly under-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “fluidly logical mind” and tactile communion with the terrace glass—but the story never tests his belief in silence-healing against a counter-impulse; the arc is a smooth enactment rather than a struggle. The final smile registers satisfaction, not cost, so the renunciation/change feels under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motives are clear and anchored in generations of stewardship, but her interior contradiction (desire to claim vs sworn duty to steward) is asserted rather than dramatized; the decisive act of preparing the throne for another is coherent yet lacks on-page anguish to charge its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the contradiction between craving solitude and answering the call is dramatized through the ring’s warmth and her scarred hand. Micro-choice to step through the door costs her the sanctuary she spent 97 days building. Motivation is rooted in remembered duty rather than abstract virtue. Slight deduction for “tender” as label rather than demonstrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s survivor backstory is stated, not dramatized; the “virtuously mischievous” label is repeated but only shown once (rule-flouting descent). Interiority is generic (“scientific mind,” “desire for redemption”) and emotions are labeled rather than embodied. The bolt choice is motivated by abstract redemption, not a concrete, costly trade-off visible in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elegant stillness does double duty, yet emotional payoffs (“he knew that his ancestors would finally rest”) arrive as abstract summary rather than embodied sensation, blurring cause and effect across generations.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Galen’s interiority is consistent—withdrawal, quest, awe—but emotions remain more described (“shivering bliss”) than embodied. The arc of refusal-return is legible, yet the micro-choice to stay feels stated rather than agonized. Earned, but cost registers late and lightly for one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Eleanor’s grief and archival compulsion are embodied in tactile micro-choices (adjusting the lamp, tracing dust). The final meeting with Benjamin crystallizes her arc from passive observer to active witness, paying the cost of reopened loss. Interiority is specific, but the dialogue exchange is slightly too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (quiet compliance vs. active rebellion) play out in micro-choices under pressure. The TrueComm key and lagoon archive function as charged objects that reveal her values and force visible cost. The final renunciation—abandoning the physical archive while securing the data—earns its weight through prior causality. Secondary character Theodor adds pressure but remains more emblem than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Etha’s motives are lucid, but his inner conflict toggles between cliché (“haunted by prophecy”) and original negative-space musical logic. His embodied tension—hand on sax, breath stilled—registers palpably on the page. Yet the pivotal choice to “hush” the prophecy arrives as smooth narrative summary rather than a wrenching decision shown in micro-gesture; cost is declared rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her stained fingers, humming, and skin-tinged transformation—but the “always emerges transformed” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the moonstone moment supplies a micro-choice that just earns the change, yet the cost feels gentle rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—precision vs. acceptance—is embodied in micro-choices (pocketing gears, weaving vines) and culminates in a credible renunciation with felt cost. The shift from “obsession with precision” to “dancing with chaos” is dramatized, not declared. Backstory is lean and anchored to present action. Minor slip: “uncertainly certain” is label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s desire “to understand the weight of names” is dramatized through each etched zodiac glyph and the forging choice that redefines purpose; interior contradictions (failure vs redemption) are embodied in the foundry heat and luminous regret he bears in his hands, making the earned renunciation credible and weighed.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile handling of the tooth and bell, the embodied ache of his sister’s memory—but the “modest fearlessness” trait is asserted rather than tested; Thomas’s brief appearance supplies pressure yet remains more symbol than crucible. The final laugh crystallizes change, yet the cost to Elias feels generalized rather than personally stinging.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s embodied trauma and proprioceptive curse/gift are vivid; the micro-choice to align the strap with forest glyphs crystallizes his arc. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, yet the final “equation of mercy” lands slightly abstract, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction (“anchors of intuition,” “eternal instant”) that blurs embodied stakes. The grandmother’s deathbed whisper is the only concrete emotional anchor; the rest is retrospective summary. Micro-choices are implied rather than dramatized in the present scene. Closure is felt, but the cost is more asserted than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s “skillfully observant” trait is dramatized through the dust-sampling beat and the mainspring barrel choice, giving us embodied competence under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “weightless burden → calling” flip is asserted more than earned from visible contradiction or cost. Still, his professional lens (elevator/vertical space) consistently filters perception, keeping voice particular.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eldon’s longing to compress eternity is vivid and embodied, but his interiority drifts toward abstraction (“desperate longing to hold onto a past that had liquefied”) rather than concrete contradiction. The final renunciation—accepting the library’s transformation—earns its cost through prior obsession, yet the micro-choice to touch the floating words feels slightly under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile tracing of the shard, the burnished sorrow, the micro-choice to drape mirrors—yet the shift from revolutionary to poetic mediator feels slightly under-motivated; the cost of his new stance is stated rather than embodied in a final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingers “danced,” the stone “pulsed with his heartbeat”—and his motive to “reclaim the light” is embodied in the climactic tethering. Yet the contradiction between preserving pre-fracture songs and the sudden need to “mend what isn’t torn” is asserted rather than dramatized in scene, blunting the cost of his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s layered eccentricity (thirty-seven years of bottled rain-scent) is palpable; her decisive moment—walking into warm lagoon water with compass in hand—shows earned risk. Interior contradictions (longing vs. self-reliance) remain implied, limiting depth, yet micro-choices under pressure hold.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is textured (“spirited,” “perpetually learning”) and her final renunciation of the GPS carries cost, but the slide’s agency overshadows hers; her contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the shift from mystery to revelation is more narrated than dramatized through micro-choice. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ellara’s interiority is vivid—her haunted compulsion to “trace the encrypted diary spines” and the embodied taste of teargas—but the shift from professional duty to personal blood-memory is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve to publish feels slightly unearned because the cost of that choice is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elior’s interiority is coherent and embodied (“fingertips tracing the amber bottle”), but the pivot from solitary thinker to community catalyst is asserted rather than dramatized; the final smile feels unearned because no contradictory impulse is staged on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s shift from passive archivist to active emotional archaeologist is embodied in the tactile handling of the wax shaving and the final candle-lit resolve; the velvet disquiet gives a consistent, embodied emotional register. Yet the prophecy arrives more as external oracle than as the scribe’s own contradiction in action, so the cost feels foretold rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Anya’s interiority—her numbered days after the hatching—drives every seed placement; the contradiction between furious motion and tranquil intent is embodied, not stated. The final reach toward the vortex is earned by prior beat work and a visibly costly renunciation of cataloguing. Minor flattening appears in the phrase “her biological clock striking midnight,” a diagnostic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile testing of the rope, his credulous curiosity—but the final beat is more quiet triumph than visible cost; the smile feels earned yet not foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elion’s spiritual curiosity and empathic openness are consistent, but the story never dramatizes an internal contradiction or micro-choice that costs him anything; the final transformation is asserted rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s tranquil perception is shown through gesture and silence, not told, and the embodied cost—perpetual muteness as keeper—lands with credible weight. Interiority remains concrete ("the box grew warm in their hands"); however, the final shift from astonished witness to chosen guardian is more asserted via image (the bee dissolving) than dramatized through contradiction or struggle, blunting the earned-stasis edge.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers tracing the emerald-veined walls”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final renunciation of linear time is more stated than dramatized with visible cost. The cremation-urn fragment functions as an extension of her perception, yet its emotional weight is summarized rather than tested in a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the poet’s contradictory impulses remain static; no micro-choice under pressure alters her stance. The final “completion that had nothing to do with finishing” is felt, yet the cost is abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied—arthritis flares, trembling fingers—but the shift from passive caretaker to active bridge-builder is summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the “brazen calm” is stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. Final renunciation earns its poignancy yet feels slightly pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.7)
    Contradiction between skeptic label and sudden acquiescence lacks dramatized micro-choices; epiphany reads imposed. Interiority veers into tidy philosophizing rather than embodied struggle. No visible cost on him leaving amber—loss is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Coachman’s interiority is vivid—seed pods as “soft language of hope” embodies motive—but the decades-later coda dilutes the single-scene pressure; the final smile feels summary rather than earned cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bloodhound's sensory gift and history are made concrete through embodied action—rubbing the wax leaf, noticing prism-split words in grooves—rather than told. Each micro-choice (packing, redirecting toward the valley, holding the second leaf) stems from a coherent interior contradiction: duty to the dead vs. hunger for living reunion. Cost appears in the final beat: "once used his senses to find the dead; now they had led him to new life"—a renunciation of past identity priced in the image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—shunned yet indispensable—animates the portrait, but the evolution from isolation to acceptance-of-duty is asserted rather than dramatized in on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his heart “racing and calm,” his smile “sacredly playful”—but the internal contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in a single moment. The theft of the chess pieces is motivated by need, yet the moral cost is glossed; the final choice to mend time is credible but feels foregone. Secondary pressure from the master arrives late and is expositional rather than relational. Overall, a vivid but slightly under-pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—benevolence vs. ruthlessness—surface in her tactile handling of the pawn and the gallery’s echoes, but the interior conflict is stated more than dramatized in real time. The cost of her selective remembering is implied rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maven’s interiority—“home as a moving tapestry of connections”—is vivid and embodied, but the leap from passive wonder to world-reshaping agency reads more lyrical than causally earned; the moment where feather-texture unlocks corridors comes at readerly cost because no prior scene showed her micro-decisions narrowing to this singular trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the tutor’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness drive every micro-choice. The final reconciliation with the prince lands as earned because the tapestry decoding and labyrinth entry visibly cost him the last of his pride. One minor slip: “productive fidgeting” is repeated rather than deepened in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“mist curled around them like listening spirits”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final renunciation is foreshadowed yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcel’s interiority is rich and embodied—his trembling palm, weathered fingertips, the warmth of the charm against his chest—but the final “realization” is articulated rather than dramatized, softening the cost. The contradiction between obsessive repair and acceptance of imperfection is present yet never forces a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path. Still, the specificity of his memories and the sensory anchoring keep him vivid and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears blurred his vision”), but his contradictory impulses (aloofness vs. longing for connection) are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice to paint the masterpiece is foreshadowed yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s longing for his sister is palpable, but the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“tears of screaming tenderness”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to pluck jasmine is concrete, yet the moment of contact with his sister is off-stage, muting the cost of his belief. Captain Morgan’s late softening feels like an external validation rather than a crucible that forces Elias to confront a flaw. Still, the character arc from skepticism to keeper-of-whispers is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—navigator’s scars, grafted skin, and the bronze censer foot as talisman all reveal character under pressure. Motivation to guide others through “geography of loss” is dramatized in the midnight call and the bridge-building choice. The final smile is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “raw solace” is named rather than shown once.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “tears streamed down her face” at the naming of herself shows contradictory release and exhaustion. The micro-choice to pocket the second eye crystallizes her shift from safety-seeking to healer, with visible cost (solitude broken). No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through her truffle-forager’s exacting gaze. The flaw of over-rationality is confronted and re-priced in the final smile.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s eccentricity is shown through concrete habits (no phone, star-talk) and his micro-choice to descend the dock, but the borrowed memories arrive as external gift rather than earned internal shift; final gesture of release is credible yet lacks visible cost on Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is tangible and specific—the “empirically intuitive” trait shows when he deciphers the ants’ pattern. Yet his moment of choice in the doorway feels sketched more than dramatized; the emotional cost is summarized (“not the easiest but the truest”) rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—the yearning vs. rulership burden—drives every beat and final renunciation, but two “weight lifting from shoulders” glitches are stock filler.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“scientifically romantic mind,” “hair the color of embers”), but the secret’s content is withheld, muting the stakes of her reaction and the cost of her resolve. Her shift from preservation to transformation is stated rather than dramatized through a micro-choice, so the change feels partially earned rather than fully paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “aching for a time he’d never known”), but the piece leans on summary rather than on-page micro-choices to show the shift from chronicler to cartographer of consciousness. The final renunciation (rolling the scroll) is legible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to this man’s lived flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s loss of smell viscerally propels her water-clock vocation; every turn hinges on her tactile trade-offs. Interiority avoids labels—her clenched jaw at the clamp-screw shows contradictory grief and purpose. Motivations clear; the arc is earned through renunciation that forecloses one path and crystallizes a new one.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s crystallization affliction and rune-scholar vocation are vividly embodied; the micro-choice to whisper her grandmother’s charm halts the physical crisis and crystallizes her stance. Interior contradiction—fear of failure vs. desire to help—drives every beat. The earned cost is the irreversible shedding of the quill tip, sealing her renunciation of further attempts on her own scars. Only a slight excess of reflective summary keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eloise’s guilt and need for atonement are embodied in the tremor of her hands and the weight of the perfume bottle; the micro-choice to open it despite fear crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Beatrice’s spectral presence exerts immediate pressure, forcing Eloise to voice the apology and accept its incompleteness. The momentary merging of fingers—mist into flesh—renders the cost of irreversible loss palpable. Only the slight over-articulation of “wilderness of my conscience” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The translucent witness embodies a clear, escalating motive—unify cosmic fragments—yet interiority remains abstract; no embodied contradiction surfaces until the final beat, where the cost is felt as “substantial enough to affect physical reality.” The arc is coherent but leans on cosmic shorthand rather than specific, character-bound struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arlo’s desire to hear clocks rather than merely count seconds is clearly stated, but his interiority flirts with stock phrases (“truly seeing”) and the final renunciation, though earned, is rendered gently rather than under embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her spatial gift is embodied in how she maps light and adjusts the laser. The shift from suspicion to partnership is earned through micro-choices with the barrier. The cost—letting go of defensive certainty—is felt in the final near-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena's internal contradiction—rebellion vs inheritance—materializes in concrete beats (hospital whisper, lantern touch, subway scrawl). Each choice flows from this fracture; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost as she packs up and prepares for another traversal, foreclosing easier paths. No drift in motivation or label-speak under pressure; the father remains off-page yet his absence is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s cultivated estrangement and grief are embodied in tactile rituals with the glass disc, but the pivotal shift from isolation to connection is compressed into a single late conversation; the interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized across beats. Meredith’s off-page presence dilutes the crucible effect, so the cost of reopening feels more declared than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the archivist’s contradictory impulses—clinging to analog craft while accepting obsolescence—play out in micro-choices (mixing inks, sealing the vial). The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost. Minor drift into abstract self-diagnosis (“haunted euphoria”) slightly blurs immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Archie’s loneliness and reciprocity belief are embodied in the moon-rock hoax, but the story summarizes rather than dramatizes his moment-to-moment choices; the final “community of believers” lands as earned stasis yet we never see him weigh a concrete risk.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elion’s tactile perception and grief anchor the story, yet his interiority occasionally lapses into abstract emotion-labeling (“quiet blaze”) and convenient pattern recognition in the climax. The transformation beats—ring warming, melody leading—feel externally driven rather than directly compelled by hard character choices. Earned stasis is present, but cost is muffled by lyrical exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt-driven determination is palpable, and her “confidently uncertain” stance is dramatized through the micro-choice of writing the contingent note. Interiority is specific, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure. The final renunciation (accepting ongoing uncertainty) is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The “joyful sorrow” is asserted rather than embodied through micro-choice. His final vanishing feels pre-ordained, not earned by on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s guilt vs. preserver’s drive—are embodied in trembling fingers and micro-choices (restoring the portrait with arsonist knowledge). The final image of her future self at peace crystallizes earned change with visible cost. Minor slip: “analytically intuitive” is label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her drumming as embodied defiance, the half-consciousness of Theo lodged inside her—but the final beat leans on lyrical assertion (“separation becomes merely an illusion”) rather than dramatized cost, keeping the earned change just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marlo’s trait of recognizing walks is dramatized early and pays off when he tracks Vance, but the interior contradiction between his quiet pride and fear of discovery is only sketched. The final “shrug” and key gesture show earned restraint, yet the cost feels light for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Guardian’s interiority is embodied in the tactile dance of shutters and mirror; the spiraling calm is both trait and tool, constraining every micro-choice. The visitor’s half-spoken secret functions as external pressure, but the guardian’s motives remain abstract—no visible contradiction or cost surfaces before the final nod. Earned stasis is hinted at yet not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Arthur’s interior contradiction—gift of listening vs fear of losing creativity—is embodied in crystal-cradling and chess displays; final renunciation of rule-only chess lands with cost amplified by the same crystal. Students remain off-page, slightly lowering status-pressure score.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s bodily memory and the “emptiness in her chest” are vivid and earned; her shift from routine to surrender is embodied, not stated. The grandmother aside fulfills BRR (anchors in scrimshaw feel and rewrites her stance). Minor drift: “true nature” nears label-speak but is rescued by concrete divestment. Earned stasis at finale: the island’s re-submersion is the visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is present—blank face vs theatrical narration—and embodied in the whittling micro-choices. Motivation (“cultivate lightness in grief”) is stated but not dramatized through a single decisive beat; the performer’s stance crystallizes without visible cost, so it stops just short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the poet’s “tremor of certainty” is stated more than embodied. The final transformation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of physical form), yet contradictory impulses remain under-developed. Micro-choices are present but generalized (“reached out,” “stepped forward”) rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her colorblind perception, tactile plant language, and the reed tongue as proxy motive all feel lived-in. The final beat where she silently trades the reed for Gideon’s awakening earns its poignancy because her earlier “innocently cunning” pattern-making has already shown stakes. Minor slip: the sudden return of her color vision feels externally granted rather than earned by her own contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the bell-ringer’s motives are stated (“to discover the texture of connection”) rather than embodied in a single decisive choice. No contradictory impulses surface in-scene; the moment of listening is affective but does not force a micro-choice that forecloses a path. The ending reiterates curiosity without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s grief is embodied through her craft and the observatory’s presence, but interior contradiction is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final stance—continuing to guide others—feels earned by the backstory, yet the cost is stated more than felt. Motivation is consistent, yet no micro-choice under pressure crystallizes the turn; the pivot remains off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—scientist vs mystic—comes through in the micro-choice to measure card placements; the inherited flaw deepens under pressure and forces the climactic invitation to Yang.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly pattern-seeking vs. the need to abandon patterns—drives every micro-choice; the embodied cost of merging with the archive is felt on the page. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies under pressure. A single POV keeps interiority tight, though the final “smile through tears” flirts with cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (tightening fingers on the stone), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final recognition of the lost friend is moving yet feels slightly under-motivated by prior causality, landing more as elegy than earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her finger feels the chameleon’s tail tighten, her smile is “genuine for the first time”—but the betrayal is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the contradiction that should drive her. The final stance is earned, yet the partner’s absence keeps the relationship crucible off-stage, limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her telepathy with plants is embodied in the whispered plea “Take us back”—but the shift from wound-opener to integrator is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation (“learning to live within their stories”) lands as summary rather than a micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her spatial imagination and psychometry are embodied in tactile handling of film—but the “unused love” motive is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat. Micro-choices (threading the film, tracing sprocket holes) align with motive, yet the climactic promise to “give you voice again” feels slightly unearned because prior stakes for her personally are only hinted at. Still, the contradiction between caretaker and voyeur is present and the ending carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—‘her hands ached to work again’—but the epiphany that rest equals ‘listen differently’ is asserted more than dramatized; still, the final micro-choice to trace star-paths and turn homeward earns the thaw of her creativity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The freight guard’s interiority is concrete—his “dreamless eyes” and the flutter he feels at the end anchor his arc. Motivation (“to cultivate the sparks”) is stated early and re-earned in the final beat. The Archivist’s single appearance supplies relational pressure that tilts the guard’s stance. No slips touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kaelen's interiority is vivid and character-specific (the “hum of insight,” the gear warmed by unknown metal), yet the arc is emotionally safe; the renunciation at the end is accepted with wonder rather than tested under pressure, so the cost feels light. Still, his flaw—solitary drift in self-built rainforests—drives the journey and is embodied in every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maris’ interiority is concrete, her contradictory impulse (tension between duty and personal longing) is embodied through the dragon-bearing, and the final endurance carries clear cost. Secondary guides remain gestures rather than distinct individuals, keeping headcount manageable. The earned stasis (carrying dormant courage forever) satisfies the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied (phantom tingles, trembling hand) and the final choice is foreshadowed by the bolt’s warmth and the step’s pulse. The shift from passive acceptance to active singing is earned through tactile discovery and memory. Flaw: the “accident” revelation is told rather than dramatized, blunting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied—her “steady hand” and “small frame radiating power” show contradiction between stature and authority. The final self-unmasking is earned by prior dread and ink-propelled choices. Yet the exile backstory is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the flaw-to-cost arc.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s motivation—childhood trauma from coral bleaching—anchors her witness stance; interiority is embodied in the tactile tapping and salt-stung cheeks. The final renunciation (accepting paths vanish because their time has passed) is credible, yet the shift from passive observer to active acceptance feels slightly under-cooked—no single micro-choice dramatizes the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; the barefoot stargazer’s contradictory impulses (“uncertainty” vs “determination”) are stated rather than dramatized. Her final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels abstract. Motivation (“seeking something she couldn’t name”) remains vague until the last paragraph, weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her weathered hands, the pulse of volcanic rock—but the “implanted destiny” feels externally pasted rather than internally wrestled; the final smile lands as tidy resolution rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s somatic-marker coping mechanism is embodied and specific; the photograph ritual and pearl-of-stillness concept anchor her contradictory impulses. The final release of the photo earns renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though “diagnostic label-speak” in “somatic markers” and “freeze-frame” slightly blurs embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“charcoal into gray oblivion,” “cloying sadness”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract—no moment shows her simultaneously pulled toward and against the descent. The final shift from despair to “luminescent ache” is declared rather than dramatized through a micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The albino tracker’s childhood drive is clear, embodied fear of slowed time, and interiority shows contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro-choices (projecting the drone, stepping into ink) align with the central stake. A credible renunciation—acceptance of temporal flux—earns change with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—duty vs revelation—drives every beat; her embodied panic (“breath stabilizers struggled”) and micro-choice to transmit anchor the arc. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she sits awaiting arrest, oath broken. No stock phrasing; voice stays particular. Could edge higher if the 20-yr backstory felt less summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhiannon’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between hunter heritage and nurturer identity is dramatized through micro-choices like wrapping a cutting in the sandbag scrap. The final renunciation—sheathing the shears—earns Earned Stasis with visible cost: another day’s labor against entropy. Flaws (hyper-perception as burden) complicate her calm without tidy resolution. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fisher’s cool-headedness is embodied in deliberate micro-choices (zigzagging, voicing silence) and the rail-spike anchor, but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized; the final smile registers cost yet feels slightly abstract, not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “dancing” over documents, the pen nib “tapping her chin”—but the emotional contradiction between legacy guilt and investigative zeal is summarized more than dramatized. The final resolve to “write the truth” is credible yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s deafened guilt and the baby-cry firmware anchor his inner contradiction through embodied micro-choices (tracing patterns, signing to the AI). The amber-insect’s repurposing and the lullaby breakthrough crystallize cost in Earned Stasis: guilt silenced at the price of never hearing her again. Interiority is specific to skin and circuitry rather than label-speak, though one beat toward “old guilt nested in his chest” nudges toward abstraction. All present criteria met without major slips.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “lilac unease” is embodied, not labeled—and his micro-choices (tilting a ridge of green sand) directly enact his social perceptiveness. The final renunciation of chalk carries felt cost. Yet the crowd remains a single undifferentiated mass, so relationship pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s “gentle radical” nature is embodied in the tactile act of placing the tessera and the whispered renaming; the interior contradiction between steel and empathy is shown, not stated. The retrocognitive visions are anchored in present gesture (hand on mosaic), so memory alters tactics rather than summarizing. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies to the final choice, but the cost—his perpetual haunting—is only implied, not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s longing for an endless encore is vivid and embodied, but the interior contradiction—his need to let go in order to save the garden—remains stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final dissolution feels inevitable yet not fully earned by a prior micro-choice that visibly costs him.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in her simultaneous awe and doubt toward the geode, but the interiority drifts into summary (“her affectionate heart ached”) rather than embodied contradiction. The brother’s off-stage suffering supplies motive, yet the on-page stakes pivot on the geode’s behavior more than her active micro-choices. The final shift from skeptic to believer is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s sensory gift is embodied early and tied to the cave descent, but interior contradiction is thin; the fossil’s “choice” of her feels asserted rather than earned through visible flaw or cost. The final acceptance of role is credible yet sketched more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her “practiced hands,” “quietly inspired” reaction to the echo—but the shift from solitary observer to communal guide is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to make the final choice costly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Volkov's contradictory impulses ("prudently daring") anchor early and pay off when the lattice pattern in snow crystallizes resolve. Internal conflict between spy reflex and burned disillusion is embodied—fingertips distrusted, pillbox weighted—drove the climactic refusal to use the photo as tactical token and instead reclaim it as future promise. However, the articulation of "unused courage" verges on meta-explanation at the final lines, softening the earned charge. Visible cost: acceptance that some breaks stay broken.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"spindrift serenity" and the pricked-thumb moment—but the coachman’s choices remain observational; no decisive micro-choice alters the crossing’s fate, only ritual completion. The palimpsest promise is evocative yet abstract, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personal. Still, the sensory attention and generational weight give him specificity beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is embodied and specific—his potter’s gestures, the warmth of the glass, the circular motions that mirror his wheel. Motivation is singular and intensifies: from curiosity to caretaking. The final renunciation—choosing to return with others—carries visible cost (he stays through the night, hands shaping invisible clay). Minor slip: “sharp gentleness” is repeated as label rather than dramatized once.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—she “touches the lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth” and “feels connected”—but the decisive choice to row out and reflect light is more asserted than dramatized; the meeting with Jim retroactively motivates rather than pressures. Embodied emotion is present yet flattens into gentle nostalgia. The final nod is credible but the cost is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her “brittle awakenings” are embodied in tactile fragility and the mosaic image of golden light sealing cracks. Motivation to become “simply Elena” is clear and drives the final stance. Yet the shift from isolation to symbiosis with the library feels slightly abstract; the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “inevitably whimsical” lens colors every perception—but the shift from emptiness to inspiration is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation (“never write another letter that didn’t contain this truth”) lands as epiphany rather than earned cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the moment of touching the nest is pure recognition, not struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession is clear and embodied (“fingers traced,” “consumed every waking hour”), but interior contradiction is stated rather than dramatized; the final choice to transmit is motivated yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally lacerating.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are embodied in micro-choices—hesitation at thresholds, humming to steady nerves—culminating in the irreversible step through the portal. The generational weight of the compass and her grandfather’s stories anchor motive without exposition dumps. Final cost is felt: she abandons the compass and her known world. Interiority stays specific; no stock therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's face-blind condition is shown through her tactile method and memory of shapes, but interiority remains mostly summary; the final choice to accuse the assistant is stated rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s interiority is vivid—copper nail as talisman/burden, inherited dread, obsession with ancestor’s disgrace—but the shift from “family duty” to “scientific obsession” is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. The final activation is motivated, yet the cost (institutional blindness, personal risk) is more declared than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for legacy reunion vs. witnessing impossible amnesty—are embodied and acted upon. His “luminous disbelief” evolves into the lantern that carries him onto the scaffold, a visible micro-choice locking him into pursuit. The brother-shaped hole in his motivation is credible, but the brother is absent on-page; thus status/relationship crucible is unavailable. No internal contradiction surfaces in the final ascent, so the change reads more as submission than earned resolve, capping just short of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias possesses clear contradictory impulses—legacy versus reinvention—yet interiority drifts toward summary (“polished calm,” “troubled heritage”) rather than vivid embodiment. Micro-choices exist (boxing the currencies for donation) but are muted and feel narrated rather than pressed under stakes. Relationships with Marcus and mother remain off-page warnings, so status pressure and crucible heat are largely absent. The final endurance reads credible, but causality from scarred identity to choice isn’t fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her dream-chronicler identity is shown through action (clipboard, telescope focus) rather than label. Motivation intensifies cleanly from private torment to shared urgency once the telegram arrives. The final “shared burden” beat with Dr. Thorne crystallizes her arc, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied ("fingers wrapped tightly," "warlike serenity etched"), but the mentor remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The druid’s contradictory impulses (guard vs. sacrifice) are shown through the blood-feeding of the seed, earning the final acceptance of truth with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Visionary’s arc credible—root-bound trait ties directly to the ritual, then resolved in the maze—but interior texture flattens into summary phrases like “understood the covenant’s true nature” without dramatized contradiction. No second character, so relationships clause is N/A. Earned cost is present yet stated, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. learned patience—surface in the trammel beat, but the interiority drifts toward summary (“she had learned patience”) rather than embodied contradiction at the moment of choice. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost (absorbing the memory into the card), yet the emotional layering flattens slightly under lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority crackles—his conflicted reverence, embodied expertise, and final glimmer of reclaimed passion are coherently rooted in both the shard and the curtainside realism. Motivation cascades: grief → failure → appraisal → re-ignition, paced to tighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the seed, the “second heartbeat” line—but the story leans on summary of predecessors’ madness rather than dramatizing her own contradictory impulses in scene. The final boarding of the vessel is a clear micro-choice, yet the cost feels generalized (“never felt less lonely”) rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The librarian’s shifting identities are embodied in the ritualized smelting and tide-cycle, but interior contradiction is more asserted than dramatized; the final synthesis is resonant yet feels lightly earned because the cost is poetic rather than viscerally staged.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inspector emerges quickly through sensory skepticism; her micro-choice to descend the unmapped passage crystallizes curiosity and propels the narrative. Internal contradiction—bunker scorn vs. compassionate mission—plays under stress and guides the climax. Final stance crystallizes with earned cost in the caves.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s grief-sharpened interiority, her methodical nature and the contradiction between scientific rigor and raw emotion are consistently embodied. The accordion acts as both wound and instrument; her micro-choice to press its taped bellows one last time before descending crystallizes a hierarchy of values (science vs forgiveness). The final renunciation – “currents cannot be charted until we are ready to drown in them” – lands with visible cost: she willingly steps into unmanaged pain rather than medicated distance, earned by every preceding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is evocative ("veiled dreamer adjusted their diaphanous covering") and embodied, but the character’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized until the final “step back,” which is reported rather than enacted. Motivation is clear—find the library—but the internal stakes never tighten visibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motive—preserving the dream against empire—clings to the reader, but interiority drifts toward exposition (“a fragile seedling to preserve this singular dream”). Embodied choices are concrete only at the violin ritual; earlier interior beats register as report. Last-image payoff earns partial credit yet emotional contradiction stays muted.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her guilt over her sister threads every micro-choice, and the tactile handling of the emerald chip shows embodied emotion. The single on-page character passes the crucible test: her final placement of the vial crystallizes a renunciation (she cannot save, only preserve) with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however, so the 9+ quick test just misses.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (moonstones warming against skin, scallop-shell light), but her “kindly decisive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the climactic insight feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled for. The antique hairpin’s lineage is vivid, yet the betrayal’s forgiveness is summarized rather than re-lived under pressure. Closure is earned via renunciation of seeking external peace, but the cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s interiority is textured—his “cloak of doubt” and “protected vulnerability” are embodied in micro-choices like unhooking specific chimes—but the fisherman remains a cipher; their relationship lacks crucible pressure, muting the cost of Elian’s counsel.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elien’s paradoxical aging and deliberate withholding create a credible mentor whose withheld truth costs Maya—and himself—a decade of life. Maya’s micro-choice to demand “Show me” crystallizes her shift from passive pupil to active seeker. Interiority is spare but embodied in the tightening skin and trembling platform. The relationship’s power inversion lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s centuries-long absorption and reverence are shown through tactile ritual—trembling hands, bare feet in dust—but his interiority drifts toward abstract pronouncements (“something nameless within his spirit”). The final renunciation is earned yet stated more than dramatized; the cost is felt but not embodied in a last gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for wonder while fearing inadequacy—drives every beat; the embodied moment of unstrapping the Regulation Pack crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him institutional safety. The final shift from “underachieving” to “present” is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hemingway’s lifelong synesthesia and quiet dedication are sketched with economical interiority; the brass key’s tug and the librarian’s test crystallize a credible renunciation. Motivation stays rooted in sensory mystery, and the final vow carries visible cost in multicolored flames. Yet the librarian remains a cipher whose centuries of knowledge never press against Hemingway’s limits, muting relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Loran’s quiet enthusiasm vs. “stellar doubt” tension is embodied in the shaky coin toss and trembling fingers, but the interiority leans on labels (‘stellar doubt’ ‘cosmic focus’) rather than contradiction, and Korin drifts into observer status so status pressure dissipates—yet the cost of broadcasting humanity’s evolutionary signature lands palpably.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative (“voice like dry leaves”), but the reaper’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final naming feels more therapeutic than earned. Embodied emotion is strong, yet the micro-choice to name “Solitude” lacks visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mage’s “lukewarm” self-concept is embodied in the final bell-tone and in his modest interiority, but the piece leans on summary rather than scene-level contradiction; the cost (his powers “beginning to warm”) is felt yet not dramatized in a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thomas’s “precisely humane” trait is dramatized when he chooses to overturn the official narrative, paying the cost of complicity; interiority is embodied in the tactile handling of the label and the quiet phone calls. The final stance crystallizes with visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her sentimental box, mentor memory, and spiral-recognition all feel particular—but the final beat (“perfect balance… now a permanent part of her being”) is asserted rather than embodied, softening the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers flew across the encrypted keypad”), but the pattern seeker’s contradictory impulses remain implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“speaking with clarity that belied the complexity of their burden”), satisfying the 9+ quick test at the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya’s numb aurora of post-ego hollowness is embodied through micro-choices—hesitating hands, forced breath—as she channels vitality into the jar-brain; contradictory impulses (resist versus feel) play in-scene, leading to the earned renunciation of numbness. Interiority remains specific and character-bound, though secondary characters (Master Chen, rebel scientists) drift into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “notably receptive” trait and motivation to safeguard creativity are stated repeatedly but only demonstrated once—when she translates the seed into a new room design. Interiority is lyrical yet abstract; more embodied contradiction or visible cost would push higher.

    Silas’s grief is embodied in the blower’s modulation; the contradictory impulse to both shatter and preserve memory is clear. Motivation (restore laughter) drives every micro-choice, culminating in the renunciation when he lowers the blower. The single giggle’s echo crystallizes cost without tidy resolution. Interiority stays specific, though “mournfully eager” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—scaled fingers on spines, pendant’s pulse against the chest—but the “dimensionally homesick” label is repeated rather than dramatized. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: the guardian’s translucent edges and renunciation of place. Micro-choices (absorbing the pendant’s energy, stepping forward) align with the long-honed discipline of waiting. Still, the homesickness trait never complicates a present decision, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—weathered hands, bare feet on cobblestones, trembling resolve—but the “stoically sensitive” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final ritual. The family-curse backstory is cleanly anchored in the crozier and fuels the climactic choice, yet secondary pressure is absent; no other character appears to test him. The earned smile lands as credible renunciation of heritage, but the cost feels generalized rather than sharply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “find the beginning in every ending” motive is stated more than dramatized; her micro-choices (tuning, releasing assumptions) feel procedural rather than driven by a visible internal contradiction. The final smile and descent show earned stasis, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liam’s childhood-split trauma gives credible motive, and the hourglass-as-self symbol tracks his arc; yet interiority drifts into explanatory gloss (“he understood the physics…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, muting the cost of becoming “permanent transient.”

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s longing for his sister is palpable, but interiority drifts toward abstract “texture of connection” rather than embodied contradiction; the final reunion feels pre-destined rather than earned by micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s curiosity and sense of responsibility are clear, but interiority drifts into exposition (“he felt more disconnected than ever”) rather than embodied contradiction. The anchor chain link becomes a charged micro-choice, yet the leap from artifact to cosmic navigation feels more declared than struggled. No genuine flaw complicates the breakthrough; competence dominates, softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s curiosity and protective drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices—tightening fingers on the hearing aid, whispering into it, sitting with the child. The final re-framing of the photograph shows earned change with visible cost: her grandmother’s warning finally fulfilled. Interiority stays specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. Only the child’s voice slips toward generic innocence, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s claustrophobia is named but never embodied in concrete sensory or behavioral detail; her interiority remains evocative yet generic. Motivation to “stand by the unremembered” is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—tomorrow she will return—earns mild resonance but lacks visible cost. Voice is consistent, but contradictions (claustrophobia vs. steady breathing) flatten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (heartbeat counting as lifeline), but the digital-ghost premise is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the final “acceptance” is more summary than earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The storyteller’s singular motive—translate texture into sound—shapes every micro-choice: rising at dawn, reading birds’ flights, caressing old fabrics, guiding the diamond to resonance. Copper-veined embodiment ties craft to flesh; contradictions (frailty vs fervor) are lived rather than narrated. The final stance crystallizes as earned endurance: he quietly accepts his twilight completion with tears that pay the cost of a lifetime’s strain.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris’s shift from bitter academic to humbled witness is sketched in reflective summary rather than embodied choice; the final smile registers but lacks a preceding micro-decision on the page. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward thematic exposition (“cosmic joke nature had played”). Still, the flint arrowhead’s warming and the phone’s static supply tactile anchors that keep the arc legible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elayn’s single-minded drive pulses through every musical heartbeat; her embodied micro-choice to ask a tree’s permission before uprooting crystallises motive. The decision forecloses the orchard as sanctuary and burdens her with guardianship, all dramatized on page with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority—“respectfully rebellious,” the ledger of absences, the felt lightness of the mailbag—grounds every beat; the trembling woman’s single line crystallizes shared stakes. Motive escalates from routine delivery to life-risk reunion, paid for in real-time tension. Micro-choice of brushing hands under guard eyes carries visible cost. Minor: the daughter remains off-page, so relational crucible is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The carpenter’s twenty-year silence and craft-driven interiority are vivid, embodied, and contradictory—fear colliding with the irrepressible need to sing. Micro-choices (examining the fragment, stepping through ivy) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final smile carries earned cost: voice reclaimed, but solitude intact. Missing only a sharper flaw that complicates the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margaret’s interiority is vivid—her scarf’s scent, the “analog memories,” the embodied tremor of the fabric—but her contradictory impulses (sanity vs. eccentricity) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of the scarf is emotionally resonant yet feels slightly pre-ordained; the cost is legible but not fully earned by prior micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-driven obsession is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“luminous absence”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final acceptance feels gently earned yet lacks a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“exquisite agony of a thought struggling to be born”), but the woman remains a cipher; her final reach is reported, not dramatized, blunting the cost of her liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her skepticism and lived experience drives every beat. The final reclamation of memory is earned by decades of micro-choices—sketching, returning, kneeling—each carrying visible cost. One slip: “chronically curious nature” is label-speak mid-crisis, blunting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Archivist’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs exile—surface in the reversible exile demonstration; Prisha’s refusal to walk backwards crystallizes the lesson with visible cost. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, backward pacing) and character-specific. The final smile shows earned change: exile now has purpose through the student’s resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; “insatiably creative” is asserted rather than embodied. The final renunciation—giving pieces of herself—lands as a felt cost, yet the contradiction between surrender and control remains abstract. Micro-choices are present but lack specificity to this pruner alone.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s tremor-riven hands, inner fracture, and final micro-shift are all built legitimately off each fold-back of the silent tapestry, giving us a believable arc of endurance/renunciation. The depth of her masked exterior is consistent; the one missing beat is her not actively miscalculating before success, toning down tragic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling hands”); her curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (overlays, frame-by-frame study). The final renunciation—repairing the map to honor the divide—earns its cost from prior discoveries. Yet the empathy motive stays more stated than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her analytic habit of “untangling threads” is embodied in the tactile noting of snow-globe details. The final tear and whispered “Home” crystallize a credible shift from historical curiosity to personal reckoning with loss. Yet the “physics of letting go” remains more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses; the cost is felt but not visibly compounded by earlier mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s empathy for the ghost is rooted in her childhood silence, but the interiority remains abstract (“deep empathy for those who couldn’t express themselves”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; her choices feel predetermined. The final harmony is asserted rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elira’s quietly curious interiority is charming yet never deepens into agency; choices feel reactive until the final beat, where passive witnessing edges toward earned resonance but remains low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs. metaphysical longing—remains vivid; every cloud categorisation beat is also a self-interrogation, culminating in renunciation of safe return. The late mentor’s absence is felt as present pressure, not backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s face-blindness drives every choice: it shapes her artistic method, her navigation of the guild, and her final epiphany about soul-pattern portraiture. Internal contradictions (precision vs loss) surface through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The shift from literal sky-mapping to invisible bonds earns closure via renunciation and visible cost—the tree’s loss and her pocketed coin.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—tracing the hopscotch squares, cross-referencing the phrasebook—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a felt cost; the ending celebrates rather than tests his drive, so the change reads as triumph, not renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias reads as an individual—as a craftsman who feels rather than sees, whose every micro-choice is tethered to the ticking clock of legacy—though the final beat would shiver without the force of causality driving his empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elion’s altruistic motive is clear and consistent, but his interiority is reported rather than embodied; Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” trait is asserted, not dramatized. The final communal shift is earned, yet the ghost’s noncorporeal constraint never creates a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s cold, constant motive and embodied awe give him texture; the one-eyed puppet head crackles against his skin, anchoring interior contradiction. The cost—nerves jangling, spindle pressed—lands as palpable fatigue etched on bones, not sentiment. Still, the lighthouse hush flattens secondary agency; no outside force or status tugs him, so the crucible feels solitary. No slip meets closure, and renunciation carves a legible path.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—protecting a soul-withering orchard yet yearning to use its curse for good—drives every beat; the promise to his mother anchors motive, and the final smile shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“heavy heart,” “graceless beauty”), but a few beats summarize rather than dramatize tension. The caretaker role constrains every choice, yet the story hedges on how the curse actually withers souls, blurring stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scientific lens on foam and chrysalis feels character-specific—but the pivotal “I need to atone” arrives with minimal embodied cost; the phone call resolves tension too smoothly, undercutting the promised struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the parole memory and the act of tracing patterns reveal layered motives. The final realization—stories begin in absence—earns its cost through the vendor’s century of confinement and nightly renewal ritual. Micro-choices (selecting shards, forming the door) visibly enact the hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his sensory gift and coping ritual anchor him—but the story never lets us feel the knife-edge of contradictory impulse in-scene; the “subsumed” moment is narrated rather than dramatized, blunting cost. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the final choice to smooth memories lacks a visible, embodied price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s interiority is warm but generic; her “empathetically decisive” trait is asserted rather than embodied in risky micro-choices. The cuckoo weight functions as a tidy symbol, yet her decision to use it never costs her anything visible. Relationships remain off-stage, so the “crucible” is missing; the final image feels like affirmation rather than earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Engineer’s obsession and interior desperation register in concrete fixations—micro-adjusting a cracked mirror mid-quake, choosing self-surgery via electrodes—yet the emotional ledger between solo visionary and excavated stranger crowds stays summarized rather than embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s prism-mind and latent-blaze motivation are vivid, but interiority drifts into summary (“heart beating with the rhythm of a latent blaze”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to flee with seven minutes left shows earned cost, yet earlier beats lack simultaneous conflicting impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is cleanly rooted in memory of music and the tactile craft; her interior choices—kneeling, strumming, absorbing emotion—are embodied and specific. A visible internal contradiction (“tears traced paths”) undercuts any tidy closure, sustaining cost. However, the absence of a second on-page character relieves us of relationship dynamics; we score her only under single-POV constraints. The loss sustained by hearing the sculptor’s sorrow earns earned endurance, though the beat remains interior.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—thumb on basalt, eyes on sky—but the “hopeful melancholy” is asserted more than embodied; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the prior beats show little contradictory impulse in scene. The micro-choice of lifting the stone is clear and costly, yet the shift from exile to student is narrated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s pacifism and frequency-philosophy are vivid, embodied in micro-choices (arranging forks, adjusting crystals). Interior contradiction—yearning for empathy yet fearing intrusion—surfaces only in faint whispers; a deeper clash would push the score higher. The shift from cataloguing silence to teaching empathy is earned, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s olfactorily-driven interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from ambition to stewardship is legible. Yet the “serenity within motion” motive is asserted more than dramatized, and the final beat of welcoming villagers feels slightly performative rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arion is sketched as competent, brave, and mission-driven but interior contradiction is missing; his emotions remain summary-level (“dread and wonder”) and no moment forces him into an on-page choice with visible cost. The arrow’s agency is more compelling than the pilot’s.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s professional drive is clear, but interiority stays at a cool remove—no contradictory impulses surface under pressure. The patch functions as talisman rather than crucible; her stance at the end is unchanged. No visible cost or micro-choice forecloses a path; she merely plans more work. Competence is foregrounded, struggle muted.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eira’s interior landscape—contradiction between duty and fear of silence—drives every strike, her synesthetic perceptions twisting color/music choices that reconfigure both space and stakes at the climax. Passivity never creeps in; each micro-move births a new color, evidencing a hierarchy of values with visible cost (felt aurora bloom migrates into white-light closure).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eldrin’s interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tears) and his micro-choice to uncase the flute is the hinge; yet the “spectacular failure” is only asserted, not dramatized, so the contradiction between pride and guilt is told rather than shown under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her counting of vanishing stars, her clinical detachment while “borrowing” Thomas—but the story withholds any contradictory impulse that would complicate her drive; she never flinches, regrets, or questions. The final renunciation (“You should go now”) is consistent yet feels cost-free; no visible emotional or social price is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ayla’s jittery interiority is embodied in tactile gestures (touching the pendant, adjusting her pack) and evolves into quiet confidence; the mentor’s absence functions as an off-page pressure that shapes her choices. However, the shift from courier to “deliverer of wonder” is asserted more than dramatized, softening the earned-cost threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skepticism and yearning collide in the moment she presses the prism to frost—but the “truthful lies” stance is asserted more than dramatized; the final shift from proof-seeker to story-keeper is credible yet compressed, lacking a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“touched the amber bead each evening, feeling its warmth strengthen”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final choice to sacrifice memories is foreshadowed yet feels slightly abstract because the cost is narrated rather than experienced in real time. The loom-spinner occupation is used atmospherically rather than as a crucible for choice, limiting depth. Still, the character arc from passive witness to active bearer of sound is coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orion’s interior contradiction—meekness vs. the forge’s fire—remains embodied in every hammer-fall; the barter of “silence, time, and essence” is dramatized, not labeled. The shift from overlooked to sought-after is earned by the silk-forged repairs that visibly cost him his former anonymity. Only the elders’ arrival feels slightly expository, muting the crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract summary (“motivation crystallized with each transition”) rather than embodied contradiction; the withheld-truth motive is stated repeatedly yet never dramatized as a live conflict inside a single beat. No micro-choice under pressure is shown—only observation of alternate timelines—so the final refusal to open the door feels externally imposed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet guardianship and embodied loneliness are vivid; the final act of adding his stone and letter crystallizes a credible shift from isolation to lineage. Interiority stays concrete, but the “warmly observant” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her laughter as involuntary prophecy, her “shadowed elation”—but the prophetic trait is asserted more than dramatized; no moment shows her struggling to suppress or wield it. Motivation (“shape a new dawn”) is clear yet abstract; the cost of guiding refugees is felt only in summary. Micro-choices (aligning mirrors, tapping coordinates) are concrete, but stakes pivot on off-stage fleet safety rather than personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his new heart literally colors perception—but the story summarizes rather than dramatizes micro-choices; the final “quietly explosive understanding” is asserted, not embodied. The donor-heart beat matching the valley rhythm is a strong embodied cue, yet it arrives as summary, not a beat that forces a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Samuel’s contradictory impulses—map sorrow to preserve vs surrender to arboreal witness—stay embodied through micro-choices like aligning the sextant, and the final renunciation of mere cataloging is visible in his healed grip. Interiority remains concrete and character-specific; the only minor slip is a moment of slightly elevated diction when he “acknowledges a weariness.” The closure choice carries felt cost: he forfeits the comfort of quantifying pain in favor of bearing it silently like the trees.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“hands trembled as they completed the final weave”), but motivation stays abstract—“to rekindle the dying realm” is never tested against a concrete counter-desire or flaw, so the final rest feels more symbolic than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s interior contradiction—compassion vs solitude—is dramatized through the micro-choice of smoothing the invitation and writing the note; the cost of renouncing the gathering is felt. Voice remains specific and embodied (“fingers tracing the spines,” “racing thoughts”). No stock therapy-speak; flaws drive the final stance. Slight over-reliance on abstract summary in two beats keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliza’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her guilt over past silence is palpable in the final beat—but the “creeping normality noticer” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no moment shows her noticing a micro-change that then alters tactics. The micro-choice to leave the bread is earned and carries cost, satisfying the closure test.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s gently meticulous trait is embodied in the careful handling of the lantern slide and the ledger, but interior contradiction is muted; the final smile feels more authorial than earned. Motivation is clear—preserve the vows—but the cost of that preservation is only gestured at, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliza’s motive—“to capture the sound of trust breaking”—is eccentric yet consistent; her micro-choices (false rumors, direct lie) escalate with visible cost. Interiority is concrete but occasionally drifts toward label-speak (“curiously steadfast”). The final renunciation (slipping away with the recorded silence) forecloses further action and carries felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction clear in the skeptic/convert arc, embodied in tingling skin and shifting taste, but motivation leans abstract (“understand why”) rather than rooted in personal loss or gain; final acceptance still feels inevitable because the compass choice is dramatized with costly fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhodes’s contradictory impulses—fear of external judgment vs. the need to paint Cora’s truth—are embodied in charcoal-stained fingers and the unfinished canvas; the final act of painting reclaims agency with visible cost (charcoal “blacker than ever”). Interiority is specific, memory is dramatized through tactile cues, and the Earned Stasis of choosing self-truth over validation lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skin wilting near lies is embodied, not labeled—but the story leans on summary (“cost her clients, friends, and the love of her life”) rather than dramatized micro-choices. The final resolve to leave at dawn is credible yet compressed; we feel cost but see little on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s seasonal muteness and inherited duty give her a clear, embodied motive; the interior contradiction between silence and heightened perception is shown through her bell-tuning micro-choices. Yet her arc is largely observational—she “discovers,” “knows,” “works,” but the decisive cost of her final climb is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    734’s nostalgia is palpably embodied (fingers on box, receptors fixed on impossible colours), and the internal contradiction—mechanical yet grieving—drives the miniaturisation choice; still, the absence of any second on-page character denies relationship crucible points and the “children would return tomorrow” coda is told, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo’s motivation—using the locket to reconnect the neighborhood—emerges clearly, but interiority stays generic (“his motivation strengthened”). The final renunciation is earned yet cost is only implied, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“moves with the purposeful grace of someone who knew every coral-encrusted corner”—but her contradictory impulses are summarized rather than dramatized; the final renunciation (“vulnerability encrypted as strength”) is declared rather than embodied with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the ritual of lantern-lighting, the weight of the pressed flowers—but the final beat (“I found you”) feels slightly pre-empted by the story’s reflective mode rather than earned in scene. The promise to her brother is stated early but not dramatized under pressure; the cost is felt in the reburial, yet the emotional pivot is more declarative than enacted. Still, her contradictory impulses (scientific curiosity vs. grief) are present and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction; the summoner’s contradictory impulses (“quiet intensity” vs “tranquil blaze”) are stated rather than embodied. Micro-choices—tracing symbols, positioning the wing—are present yet feel choreographed rather than pressured. The final release of the crane earns a credible renunciation, but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“stones settled…language just beyond her grasp”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the final inheritance revelation lands as external gift rather than earned choice, softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs. believer—drives every beat; the embodied tear and deliberate humming show cost. Yet “tragically radiant” and “eyes that held the sorrow of forgotten civilizations” drift into label-speak, blurring specificity under poetic overload.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt and need for redemption are embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing the forged signature, pricking his finger with the thorn—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“he needed to forgive the unfinished business”). The heritage thorn and key act as charged objects that reconfigure his stance, but the sister’s life-saving backstory is relayed rather than dramatized, softening the cost’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative (“reed-blown melancholy”) and motives shift credibly from abstract curiosity to compassionate intervention, but the child-spirit remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent and the final change feels more bestowed than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“borrowed starlight” lens), her motive to “salvage something pure” is consistent, and the micro-choice to expose truth gently shows earned cost. Yet the sabotage reveal is delivered as summary, not embodied contradiction, and the captain’s daughter backstory feels tacked-on rather than pressuring present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the philosopher’s tactile net-work and moon-path ritual reveal a coherent worldview. Yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized—his stance merely deepens—so the “earned cost” bar for 8.8+ is not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s drive to “excavate truth” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—reassembling letters, touching the diamond—yet interiority occasionally drifts into thematic summary (“humanity’s salvation or destruction”). The final renunciation is earned, but the cost is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his isolation, obsession, and variant allegiance are embodied through sensory detail and ritual action. Yet the story never dramatizes a decisive micro-choice; he only listens, translates, and watches. The final smile feels like summary rather than earned renunciation or crystallized stance, so the cost is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid—calloused fingers, “positively wistful” gaze—but his decisive act (infusing the jar) is under-motivated; we feel his longing more than the cost of sharing it. The final renunciation of anonymity carries implicit cost yet reads more as summary than embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s blending of engineering logic and felt duty is embodied (key vibrating, coat billowing), but the “logically emotional” label is asserted more than dramatized; micro-choices turn pivots (striking the fork, touching key to forehead) with clear cost—accepting lifelong guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is poetic but abstract; the mapper’s motives (“sculpt patience from impatience”) are stated more than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; choices remain observational rather than active. The final smile registers as affect, not earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her “fortified vulnerability” is embodied in the way she photographs dust patterns and water levels. The lantern triggers specific ancestral memories that tilt her present stance, and her final micro-choice (submitting findings) is earned by prior causality with visible career cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Michael’s renunciation of the repair is earned by prior guilt and the letter in his pocket; the contradictory impulses (fix vs. forgive) play out in the shop’s silence. Embodied emotion is sparse but credible. Secondary pressure from Ms. Eleanor is light yet sufficient to tilt the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is concrete and specific to the glider’s algorithmic mind; the “yearning algorithm” and “steadily curious nature” are dramatized through choices (picking up the arrow, peering into the kaleidoscope, ringing the bell). No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the final renunciation—accepting that no one hears the bell yet the act still matters—carries felt cost. However, the glider’s evolution is summarized rather than embodied in micro-choices, keeping it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and guilt are vivid, but interiority slips into summary (“needed to find,” “determined to bring justice”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of downloading and disappearing feels earned, yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on her body or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—“her shadow stretching long before her as if it had a mind of its own”—and her embodied emotion when the shard “bit into her palm” anchors motive. Yet the elders, the primary external pressure, remain off-stage abstractions; relationships cannot serve as crucible when none appear on the page. Interior contradiction is dramatized in the weighted breath itself, but causal cost to her peacekeeper status is asserted not shown. Back-story exposition (shadow-lore and orchard history) totals ~22% and drifts past the 20% BRR cap without changing her present micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet clinging to the parasol—are embodied in tactile micro-choices; the shift from escape to connection is earned by her handling of the heirloom and the final decision to stay. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Marcus functions only as gentle foil, so relationship crucible is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is evocative but drifts toward reflective summary; the burned letter is handled repeatedly yet never forces a micro-choice that alters tactics. Motivation—nurturing intersubjective understanding—remains stated rather than embodied in a decisive beat. The final “quiet cultivation” is a credible renunciation, but its cost is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line walker’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“eyes that saw between worlds while remaining grounded”), but the cost of isolation is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s calm is consistent but never tested; her interiority remains surface-level. The group’s collective action is the only beat that changes the emotional field, yet Elara herself makes no costly choice. The “earnest whimsy” label is repeated rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“weathered innocence clung to him like the scent of old paper”), but the scholar’s choices remain largely observational; the final shift from preservation to translation is declared rather than dramatized through a concrete micro-choice, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prophet’s interiority—especially the paradox of “precognitive forgetting”—is embodied in tactile gestures (chalk, driftwood) that force micro-choices under fog. Flaw: the climactic “add a final spiral” action feels externally narrated rather than a last-ditch re-weighting driven by the foretold amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her tactile relationship with the clock and the ache of confinement ground her motivation. The final choice—tuning perception instead of force—grows credibly from her established traits and costs her the safety of familiar limits. Secondary pressure from the astronomer is present but minimal; the focus remains on her solitary stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is warm but generic; the therapist’s “decisively kind” stance is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. Only one clear micro-choice—continuing to play after death—earns cost, but it feels pre-ordained, not wrestled with. Relationships are sketched, not crucibles; no status shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers moving with a quietly deliberate precision”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final realization arrives more as thematic epiphany than as earned cost. The clockwork key functions as charged heirloom, yet its emotional weight is asserted rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eleanor’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. bone-setting faith—play out in real time as she aligns realities like bones. The shift from detached observer to active intervener is embodied and earned, costing her certainty. Arthur’s liminal state forces her to confront the limits of her inherited skill, making the final hand-clasp a credible renunciation of pure rationalism.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s conflicting desires—earthbound yet star-hungry—are embodied in every beat; her polished sea-glass light-shows tighten stakes from wistful dream to earned purpose. Interiority is vivid, action-rooted, and her renunciation of fire is traceable across choices with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers tracing amber, glass creaking underfoot—but the “quietly proactive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final offering feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses. Emotional layering is present yet edges toward therapeutic summary (“grief and acceptance stages”).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; no concrete micro-choice alters the present beat. The “conflicted” label is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory action. Final peace feels asserted, not earned by visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart ached with a sudden, clear purpose”), but the story leans on summary rather than in-scene contradiction; the final smile feels earned yet the cost is more communal than personal, keeping her arc slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is embodied and consistent; the alchemist’s slow, deliberate gestures and heartbeat-synced breathing reveal a hierarchy of values. Yet the character remains largely archetypal—no contradictory impulses or blind spots surface under pressure—so the arc feels predetermined rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reflective nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing gears, mapping light angles—yet her interiority stays concrete; the final renunciation of immediate gratification for long-term echo-storage is earned and carries visible cost in her sustained solitude and labor.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the weaver’s self-doubt and wonder feel lived-in. The moment of touching their own burden crystallizes contradictory impulses—witness vs. participant—yet the final “gift” epiphany arrives slightly fast, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her fingers on the wood, the remembered weight of her husband’s hands—but the “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no single choice visibly trades safety for thrill. The final renunciation (serene lion, not snarling) is earned by the carving sequence and carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: the phrase “harvest lessons from loss” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cyrus’s regret and fractured time-sense are embodied in trembling hands and bent spine, but interiority drifts toward summary (“profoundly chronologically confused”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The final negotiation with his ghost earns its poignancy because the camera wheel’s dissolution visibly costs him his last anchor to the past. Still, the shift from scavenger to penitent feels compressed—one micro-choice on the word-bridge carries the entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are shown through tactile exploration and circuit rerouting, but interiority drifts toward summary (“wondered how many dreams”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—throwing the switch—earns its cost in the flicker of lights, yet her stoic mask stays intact without revealing deeper flaw or internal rupture. Competence is balanced by genuine struggle, but emotional layering is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning vs. abandonment—remains embodied in the trembling heart / steady hands motif and culminates in the micro-choice of soldering the pocket watch shut. The bear’s silent pressure crystallizes his renunciation of defeat, earning the final stance with visible cost: the reopened dream now carries the weight of thirty lost years.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her fingers tracing the sundial, the “serene upheaval” of realization—but the final shift from passive discovery to active teacher is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is calm and consistent, but the “infinitely patient” trait is asserted rather than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The final acceptance of the knotted rope is credible yet feels foregone rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the traveler's contradictory impulses—writing others' living obituaries while avoiding his own—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing the thread, uncapping the pen). The final turn toward self-obituary is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: "explained absences" drifts toward diagnostic label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elorian’s yearning is vivid and embodied, but the interiority drifts into abstract “hypothesizing” rather than concrete contradiction under pressure; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels more stated than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya's paradox—arsonist's child turned protector—drives every beat. Interiority shows contradictory impulses mid-action (e.g. touching black sand while fighting flames), and her final posture in the garden is earned by prior choices. The cost of heritage and chosen identity is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“luminous skeptic questioning the shadows”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely ornamental; the final choice to release memories feels inevitable rather than wrestled with, so the cost is present yet under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “otherworldly sentimentalist” is more archetype than individual; interiority remains abstract (“its form shifting like stardust”) and choices are reported rather than dramatized. Motivation (“share light without using fire”) is stated early and reiterated, but no contradictory impulse or embodied cost complicates it. The gear’s history is evocative yet external; the being’s final decision to depart feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—thumb on granite, ribbon as meditation—but the “spectral mentor” remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final renunciation (ribbon nearly gone, mentor’s work “complete”) is legible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied in a single, costly micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alaric’s ethical diligence and guilt are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the rake handle, kneeling at the tower base). The shift from solitary precision to communal vulnerability is earned through visible cost—his public admission of need. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation of lone control lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s gentle obsession with the tapestry is embodied in tactile micro-choices (“tender fingers,” “soft smile”), but the sacrificial revelation lands more as thematic epiphany than as a decision that costs him anything visible on the page; interior contradiction is present yet not fully dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her gaze sweeping,” “steady her hand”), but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final choice to draw the map is credible yet lacks a visible, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is thin—motivation stated as “simple yet profound” rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses in-scene; choices feel pre-ordained. Micro-choice (tuning the dial) is present but low-stakes. Cost is gestured at (“dangerous”) yet never dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena's interiority is concrete ("face etched with sorrow and determination") and her micro-choice to place the mask after the rocking chair stops crystallizes forty years of quiet endurance. The contradiction between her life's work—capturing ephemera in porcelain—and her admission that completion itself is impossible costs her the illusion of safety, felt on the page in the slowing arcs of the final rock.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Milo’s interiority is vivid and consistent, but the “abrasive calm” trait is asserted more than embodied; the final choice to preserve the cog is legible yet feels slightly pre-announced rather than earned under fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is warm but generic; “expectantly resigned” is asserted rather than embodied. No single on-page choice carries visible cost; her arc is summarized across seasons. The choir remains off-stage, so status dynamics and micro-choices under pressure are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s synesthetic gift and generational burden are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract “revolution starts with seeds” rhetoric rather than embodied contradiction. The pruning beat crystallizes his renunciation with tactile cost, yet the final stance feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled into being.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s involuntary honesty is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to hand over the keycard carries visible cost. The supervisor’s despair is sketched with credible contradiction, but his late arrival limits depth. Relationship pressure is minimal because the bureau pair remain functional foils rather than crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s gift is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“hushed blaze,” “echo of lives”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final insight is earned, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized—no visible forfeiture beyond a smile at sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative but abstract; the diver’s shift from certainty to nuanced doubt is shown through the ampoule vision rather than embodied micro-choices. The statue’s “incisively kind” trait is stated more than enacted. Cost is felt in the diver’s new stance, yet the beat is more epiphany than earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grim optimism is embodied in every micro-choice—rolling the dice, tracing equations, placing the chipped die at the fracture point—so the final bet feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“Fate mocks me even here”) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is a touch of retrospective summary (“Years of his existence”) that blurs present urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the painter’s insomnia, trembling fingers, and whispered conviction all reveal her under pressure. Yet the arc is static—she begins and ends in the same hopeful certainty without a visible cost or contradiction that forces a new stance. The “methodically hopeful” trait is shown but never tested against failure or doubt, so the renunciation/change criterion is only weakly met.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Khira’s embodied defiance (“the bread remembers”) and the guide’s historically anchored ache give credible interiority; the micro-choice to hand over the lens alters tactics and carries felt cost. Minor drift: the guide’s “historically oriented” label is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Esme’s counter-clockwise identity is dramatized in every beat of the yoyo puzzle, culminating in an embodied, costly act of defiance; contradictions between “neatly inventive” confidence and looming dread remain embodied rather than summarized, anchoring motive. The final shift lands as earned because her lifelong trait is now weaponized against “fate’s design” with visible stakes frozen in time.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my skin crawl while drawing me deeper”), but the advisor’s identity twist is revealed rather than dramatized through micro-choice; the final unbosoming feels slightly pre-explained rather than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prophet’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene. The “mallet tightening in fingers” gesture is the only embodied beat. Closure choice (letting the storm skirt) is asserted rather than dramatized, so cost feels external. Still, her perceptual lens is consistent and occupation-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s obsession is embodied in tactile ritual (tracing spirals, pocketing the whistle) and crystallizes into a credible renunciation when he accepts the guardian role. The interior contradiction—yearning for answers yet fearing them—survives the epiphany, but the shift from “question the watchers” to “join them” is compressed into a single paragraph, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s emotionally rational stance is embodied in her methodical note-taking and camera work, but interiority stays general; the ledger discovery is a clear micro-choice that costs her scholarly detachment, yet the shift feels slightly announced rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Contradictory stoic/sensitive trait is shown through his careful, almost reverent handling of the memory-cubes, but interiority drifts toward lyrical summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; final renunciation (“tomorrow he would listen again”) is credible but cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent but drifts toward tidy self-explication (“understood that some truths transcended classification”), blunting the bite of embodied contradiction. The inherited-stamp revelation is strongly anchored in micro-gestures (fingers on ridges, sudden re-weight in the palm) and drives a single, credible stance change, yet the emotional cost is articulated more than genuinely felt. Occupation details remain atmospheric rather than shaping tactical decisions under blackout, so professional flaw pressure never fully hits.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (folding grief into cranes) is clear and embodied through tactile craft; interiority is vivid yet occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism. The final release feels earned, but the “shadow detached” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost. Micro-choices (selecting the heart-gem, placing the lantern) reveal hierarchy of values. Flaws and contradictions are present but not deeply tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s grief-driven motives are visible, but interiority drifts into poetic labels ("strange cocktail of grief") rather than embodied stakes. Micro-choices—using the pod, placing the crystal—hold, yet emotional modulation flattens mid-beat. Final moment is an expansion, not renunciation, so cost stays abstract. Character still feels more emblem than singular individual.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya shows actionable interiority and contradicting impulses: military operator reflex versus open-wonder seeker; the perpetually surprised trait filters every reaction and directly costs her tactical edge when the drone falters under wonder. One missing gun-shy moment kept her from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Martin’s contradictory impulses—profit vs. truth—are embodied in the trembling hand on the watch; the final renunciation of his trade is earned by the grandfather carving that reweights the object. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is a slight over-reliance on reflective summary before the shore scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the antique drawer pull anchors her contradictory impulses (duty vs. personal debt). The final forgiveness is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “uncommonly thoughtful” is asserted more than dramatized in mid-scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and consistent—“merrily melancholic” is felt in action—but her final epiphany about “flickering faith” arrives more through summary than embodied contradiction, keeping the change just shy of fully earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The clean-slate seeker’s interiority is vivid (“weight of my dirty past pressed down like water in my chest”), but the moment of meeting his younger self flattens into summary rather than embodied contradiction; the looped identity never collides with present stakes in a way that forces a new micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliora’s contradictory impulses—fear of losing humanity vs. need to reach her brother—are dramatized in embodied choices (rooting feet, inhaling spices). The final renunciation of full transformation carries visible cost: she remains mortal yet “fundamentally unchanged,” foreclosing easy reunion. Interiority is specific, avoiding label-speak. Only the brother’s dialogue drifts toward generic wisdom, slightly diluting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction (“choking beauty” repeated without fresh embodiment). The cartomancer’s shift from control to surrender is legible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than viscerally hers.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s pacifism and inherited sorrow are embodied in micro-choices—detaching the crystal, steadying hands, tears that mirror ancestral salt—yet interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “profound longing” rather than concrete contradiction. The gravitational lightness is dramatized as both enabler and gauge of hope, fulfilling the 9+ test of embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s calm inventiveness is embodied in the sundial brushwork and pocketed quill, but interior contradiction is muted; the final “cradle of sparks” feels more thematic label than lived cost. Micro-choices (dip, stroke, pocket) are precise yet lack a visible personal stake or flaw-driven mistake. Relationship pressure with the Keeper is hinted but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her bare feet gripping the smooth stone where friction had long since disappeared”), but the mentor’s dying promise is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the emotional cost at the climax. The final renunciation—patterns are to be harmonized with, not controlled—earns its turn through the ritual sequence, yet the mentor’s absence keeps the relational crucible off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied ("furiously tranquil expression," "fire burning within"), but the poet’s choices remain largely observational until the final paragraph; the decisive act of writing feels slightly under-motivated by prior micro-choices. The sealed envelope and timetable are handled with tangible reverence, yet their causal impact on the poet’s resolve is implied rather than dramatized. Earned stasis is present—she descends with verses—but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid—his mechanical arm clicks with satisfaction, his pocketed needle card tugs at motive—but the student remains a sounding board rather than crucible, so relationship pressure is muted. The final “invitation to think differently” lands as earned renunciation, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstract self-labeling ("molts personalities like Phoenix feathers"); the poet’s contradictory impulses are present but not fully embodied in micro-choices. The mission to “forge beauty from anarchy” is clear, yet the cost of each molt remains more asserted than dramatized. Elias functions as off-page backstory rather than relationship crucible, limiting pressure on the poet’s present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the pianist’s grief is shown through tactile ritual (packing the clock, threading the reel). Motivation is clear—use the clock’s anomaly to defy time and reach his daughter. The final choice to step into the film-light is earned by prior research and emotional build. Only minor drift: “steely longing” is label-speak rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—“empirically whimsical” nature vs. sacred duty—surface in beats (kneeling yet doubting her worth), and the luminous-doubt smile at the end shows endurance with cost, yet interiority occasionally slips into poetic summary rather than embodied tension under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is textured and embodied, but the tutor’s contradictory impulses remain muted; the final whispered name feels more ritual than earned choice, so cost is present yet not fully scaled to the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction emerges late; the shift from cosmic to terrestrial focus lacks visible struggle until the final realization, making the transformation feel smooth rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction strong (trembling hands vs precise artist), embodied emotion via tea grip and frost study, but "realization struck with physical blow" edges toward diagnostic label-speak under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority rooted in embodied observation ("fingers tracing invisible melodies") but backstory trauma told via label ("capsize survivor had lost everything") rather than present-choice friction; diagnostic "trauma" in closure triggers -0.4 penalty per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s weariness versus stubborn persistence, but his undertaker profession lacks specific behavioral texture during key choices; the final transformation feels earned though the emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation rooted in generational continuity drives his anonymous giving, but secondary characters like Tomas lack sufficient depth to fully realize the intergenerational dynamic. Mira’s leadership potential shows promise yet remains underexplored in pivotal moments, slightly diluting the relationship-as-crucible test.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—seeking closure while fearing vulnerability—manifest in micro-choices like breath control. Her spiritual curiosity avoids diagnostic labels until the tear's "healing wounds across lifetimes" phrasing triggers a -0.5 deduction for over-articulation during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction (fear/intoxication) is embodied but lacks visceral micro-choices; the final merger feels conceptual rather than earned through concrete stakes. Epiphanies lean abstract in peak moments like "time wasn't linear."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "staggering grace" amid chains—embodied through precise micro-choices like decoding keys while hearing approaching voices. Motivation ("plant resilience in dry soil") intensifies organically to the final seed-stuffing under pressure. No diagnostic labels; flaws (over-reliance on allies' arrow) compound stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Cancer diagnosis inserted as thematic device without embodied micro-choices; "cells divided" lacks specific sensory cost. Interior contradiction strong but mortality feels grafted onto core motivation rather than integrated through prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lacks contradictory impulses during theft; "impossible grace" shows no internal conflict despite high stakes. Motivation clear but epiphany lacks embodied struggle—understanding arrives without visible cost during pivotal moonbeam handling.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority shows contradictory impulses (abandoning past yet transforming it) but "thawing heart" metaphor edges toward thematic echo; micro-choices under pressure like selecting copper for the base reveal values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction strong ("claustrophobia and cleithrophobia warred"), but seashell's "Dear child" dialogue edges into therapeutic label-speak during peak crisis, risking the -0.4 diagnostic penalty despite otherwise embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction (mild obsession vs violent determination) drives the pivotal comprehension beat; embodied cost in trembling booklet and shifted values when sketching voids instead of boundaries. Only minor flaw: slightly over-articulated "darkness as canvas" insight lacks sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction (protocol vs. curiosity) drives action, but the epiphany about thought origins edges toward abstraction without sufficient embodied struggle in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interior contradiction (power vs ethics) surfaces late; pivotal choice lacks micro-struggles showing hesitation. Strength: embodied warmth of lens, but "thaw mistrust" motivation undercooked before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's contradictory impulses (waning strength vs deepening connection) manifest physically in marble rituals; final endurance choice earns Earned Stasis through decades of mended marbles as embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority leans on diagnostic labels ("scientific detachment") without contradictory impulses in action; "subdued awakening" epiphany lacks embodied cost despite strong occupational specificity in "mechanically warm" hands during lever sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction evident in Maya's dual identity, but "unyielding compassion" remains abstract rather than demonstrated through conflicting impulses during key choices. Diagnostic phrase "scars can sing" risks thematic echo without sufficient embodied struggle in the grafting climax.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction ("luminous skepticism warring with hope") and embodied emotion ("weight of centuries pressing") earned the climax; micro-choices like visualizing memories as birds revealed values under pressure, though "realistically imaginative" trait lacked deeper conflict earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)

    Prophet's embodied motivation ("obstacles into instruments") drives action, but lacks contradictory impulses—no moment of doubt or irrationality during storm.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
