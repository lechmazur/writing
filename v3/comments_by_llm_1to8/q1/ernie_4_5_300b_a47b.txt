  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from cosmic researcher to student of terrestrial decay is earned through concrete micro-choices and embodied details. The contradiction between her need for control and acceptance of unpredictability acts throughout, particularly in "Decay isn't an event... it's a language." Minor deduction for some intellectual distance in emotional beats that could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's transformation from hollow survivor to purpose-finder is earned through concrete discovery, with her glass artist identity constraining how she perceives the frost patterns. The internal conflict between creation and survival manifests in specific choices, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("mark time, to etch her existence into the world's quiet intervals").

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael's trauma-driven motivation and her journey from voicelessness to silently expressive art is well-embodied through concrete gestures and the heat-mapping process. The relationship with Elias develops through action rather than dialogue, creating genuine pressure. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("gratitude") in the final paragraph rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's transformation from stubborn undertaker to library keeper is earned through concrete pressures and embodied moments like "his hands steady despite the cold" while mending the lens. His inadvertent stubbornness creates genuine friction, particularly in his resistance to Marisol's stories. The final choice to stay carries visible cost—abandoning his thirty-year profession—though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("equated stillness with death").

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming fear into solidarity—with concrete embodiment through her handling of the bell and decisive action. The piece shows genuine internal conflict between the council's caution and her conviction. However, the emotional texture remains somewhat abstracted ("hope frayed like old rope"), and secondary characters lack distinct voices despite being named.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's spiritual curiosity drives her journey, but her transformation from documentarian to healer feels asserted rather than earned through embodied struggle. The "pilgrim of sparks" past-life memory provides motivation but lacks the contradictory impulses and micro-choices that would make her final understanding feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives consistent action through fragment use and photograph study. The retrocognitive visions create genuine internal tension, though the final epiphany ("time wasn't a texture to be touched, but a story to be told") arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient embodied struggle in the transformation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like chains biting wrists and patience as strategic waiting. The final choice to break free and throw the vial shows earned agency with visible cost. However, internal conflict could be more contradictory in-scene rather than sequential, and the scavengers lack specificity as pressure sources.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to forge "the sound of trust breaking" drives clear, embodied choices throughout, with her synesthetic perception creating distinctive interiority. The final moment where she can "hear the silence between heartbeats, the absence where love should be" shows earned transformation with visible cost—her father's betrayal crystallized into sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a "portrait thief" who steals illuminated moments is consistent and compelling, with her hesitation about giving her own memory creating genuine internal conflict. The transformation from thief to giver lands with emotional cost when she offers the photograph. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("unable to bear the thought") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's contemplative nature manifests through concrete actions (tracing the bookmark's crack, narrating mundane tasks) and his glassblower background meaningfully informs his worldview about beauty emerging from tension. The character arc from seeking perfection to accepting imperfection earns its cost through specific memories of his mentor's death, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("Abandonment, he mused, was rarely sudden").

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's phobia-ridden nature creates genuine internal conflict that drives choices, particularly in the confrontation with the enforcer where she uses her "fear of contact to fuel her agility." The transformation from vulnerability as weakness to vulnerability as "compass" and "power" earns its closure through concrete action, though some emotional transitions (mother's sudden appearance, instant reconciliation tone) feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's obsession with silence drives concrete actions throughout, from tracing mortar cracks to creating the map by "summarizing silences." Her internal contradiction between fear and determination manifests in trembling lips while smiling at completion. The cost—walking "the edge of oblivion"—is acknowledged but the final choice to return to the shore feels slightly underdeveloped in its stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Unit-17's curiosity-driven motivation is clear and the progression from janitor to philosopher shows meaningful change, but the transformation lacks embodied emotional complexity. The robot remains "remarkably composed" throughout without genuine internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's curiosity and meticulous nature drive clear choices, with concrete embodiment in breath visibility and stub-counting. The shift from passive registrar to "translator of silence" lands with earned transformation. However, Lira lacks distinct interiority beyond cryptic wisdom-dispenser, and some emotional transitions ("Elias's throat tightened") feel abrupt rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her patient methodology consistent, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—we see her methods but not her doubts or costs. The interaction with Joren provides external pressure but arrives late; his conversion feels too smooth without genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives clear choices, particularly in the crisis recalibration sequence. The "obliging" trait manifests through competent action rather than deeper characterization. Internal conflict remains minimal—she experiences tension but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (wading through water, tracing symbols, memorizing the code). Her promise "I'll finish it" carries earned weight from accumulated detail. Internal contradictions between skepticism and belief could be sharper in scene rather than told ("she'd come to believe").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael's internal contradiction between oracle precision and post-fever uncertainty drives authentic choices, particularly her decision to leave with the botanical illustration. The "swallowed truth" metaphor effectively embodies her psychological burden. Minor deduction for the director character remaining somewhat functional rather than applying immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's skepticism creates genuine internal tension as he confronts mechanical voices and impossible holograms, with his trembling hands and tightening throat showing embodied fear that contradicts his rational stance. The final choice to leave the valve as "a silent sentinel" carries visible cost—he abandons his trophy and documentary evidence, acknowledging truths "too heavy to carry."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" drives concrete choices through the labyrinth, with internal contradiction between documenting/letting go creating genuine tension. The final transformation where they become "nothing and everything all at once" is earned through prior accumulation, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("their grip on reality loosening with each century").

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characters demonstrate clear motivation through embodied action—Elara's "mellow patience" tuning her cello, Mara's skepticism softening to "cautious exuberance." The transformation from skepticism to wonder is earned through the concrete experience with the curl's glow, though some interiority relies on abstract statements ("It's a link. To wonder.") rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to preserve forgotten stories is clear and consistent, driving concrete actions like probing the ashes and transcribing symbols. The internal tension between documenting vs. listening creates genuine complexity. However, the final transformation from passive collector to active listener feels slightly rushed, though the cost of his previous "ignoring" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes believably from discovery to action, with the father's letters providing causal weight. However, the emotional response to world-altering revelation feels understated - she "trembles" then immediately strategizes, missing the contradictory impulses that would make this discovery land with full psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The priest's motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" drives coherent action through rhetorical loops and paradoxes, with his final choice to step into "unraveled stillness" carrying visible cost. However, the character lacks embodied emotion under pressure—his actions feel philosophical rather than visceral, missing the contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's motivation is consistently rooted in her chronological homesickness, driving her to recreate the mirrored horizon through sound and fortune-writing. Her internal contradiction between living in linear time versus yearning for cyclical time creates genuine tension. The final choice to create "a symphony, unheard but felt" before exhaustion hits shows clear cost—she sacrifices conventional success for memory preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through her gravity-defying gift as metaphor for disconnection. The internal conflict between floating above choices versus engaging plays throughout, though some passages slip into therapy-speak ("labyrinth of self," "embracing every version"). The final choice to touch ground carries earned weight from the timeline exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila's emotional numbness and its embodied resolution through vibration/silence work well, with concrete details like "hands numb, chest hollow." The transformation from numbness to feeling lands with specificity. However, Elias remains somewhat functional rather than pressuring, and some therapeutic language ("emotional numbness, the doctors called it") edges toward diagnostic speak without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes believably from data-collector to truth-keeper, with concrete embodied reactions ("hands, usually steady, shook"). The transformation from isolation to engagement carries visible cost in his burning of evidence and acceptance of danger. Minor deduction for some therapeutic self-awareness ("to nurture integrity in solitude") that reads slightly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's aromatic sensitivity drives concrete choices—uncorking the vial despite known risks, embracing rather than flinching from scents. The inherited grief revelation ("a tapestry of inherited sorrow woven into her DNA") lands with embodied specificity through tears and throat-tightening, though the epiphany arrives somewhat abruptly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "read the pattern" drives consistent choices through unraveling the rope, with embodied tension ("throat tightened," "hand trembled"). The internal conflict between fleeing and confronting past choices manifests concretely, though some emotional beats rely on abstract statements ("weight of every unwritten line") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation to "find beauty in the unfinished" manifests through concrete action—positioning the violin over the bowl, transforming silence into resonance. The character's acoustic perception drives specific choices, though internal contradiction could be sharper. The final community gesture shows earned change with visible cost as residents offer precious objects.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's motivation as a dealer of "half truths" is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through his careful testing of scents and measured client interaction. His internal conflict between empathy and detachment manifests in specific choices, though Lira remains somewhat stock as the weary seeker. The ending renunciation is adequately earned through his professional thoroughness, though the emotional cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's transformation from calculating broker to compassionate actor is earned through concrete particulars (the mistaken letter, seeing Lila's overturned cart). The internal contradiction between her "shrewd" nature and growing "cautious exuberance" plays out in scene. However, her sudden ability to forge a conductor's letter strains credibility, and Lila's character remains underdeveloped beyond plot function.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his "boldly sympathetic" trait manifests in concrete actions. However, the revelation lacks genuine internal conflict - Kael experiences surprise but no meaningful cost or difficult choice at closure. The luminescent ache is named but not fully embodied through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's curiosity-driven exploration and final choice to "uncage time" shows clear motivation with embodied tension (pendant burning, breath hitching). The internal conflict between dismissing grandmother's claims and testing the pendant's power creates authentic pressure. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("interrupted cadence," "borrowed time") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation rooted in ambiguous loss drives concrete choices throughout, with embodied grief ("tears mixing with sap"). The ritual with glass eyes shows contradictory impulses—seeking answers while accepting uncertainty. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("mathematics of emotion") but the final realization about preservation as flow rather than freezing earns the closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation crystallizes clearly from passive survival to active guardian role, with embodied details like "fingers calloused from years" and concrete choices in revealing the cache. The transformation from invisibility to messenger lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("for the first time, she felt seen") rather than pure embodiment in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eleanor's internal shift from control to release is earned through concrete observation of the hellebore's metamorphosis, with embodied reactions ("pulse quickened," "breath held"). The contradiction between her desire to control and need to release plays out in scene. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated final insight about transformation that edges toward thesis-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marin's motivation is grounded in concrete particulars - the insomniac painter seeking "the *something* that haunted her since the wars ended." Her wry earnestness manifests through embodied choices like following rain trails, and the final shift from threshing to growing meaning represents earned change with visible cost (years of fractured painting).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's acceptance of chaos shows clear motivation through her interaction with the pearl, and the pilgrim's overlapping shadows create genuine mystery. However, the pilgrim lacks sufficient characterization beyond his symbolic function, and Elara's internal conflict could be more embodied during the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's patient methodology and "reactively visionary" approach create consistent motivation, though her interiority remains somewhat abstract rather than embodied. The fisherman and girl provide functional pressure but lack depth. The final choice to display the trumpet shows earned resolution through accumulated fragments, though emotional stakes could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's meticulous nature and artistic perception create genuine internal tension, particularly in his seeing "beauty in the chaos" while maintaining analytical precision. The final choice to accept the blank ticket shows earned agency with visible cost—abandoning his known routes for unknown paths. However, the woman figure lacks embodied presence, and some emotional beats rely on abstract statements ("trembling certainty settling in his chest") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's transformation from "sympathetic skeptic" to wonder-embracer is earned through embodied discovery and Aelia's memories. The internal contradiction between skepticism and curiosity plays out concretely through her actions with the tile. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("heart racing") rather than pure embodiment in transition moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's immortal boredom crystallizes through concrete embodiment ("breath hitched—a rare sensation") and his final choice to embrace fear over eternal stasis carries visible cost. The introduction of Lira feels slightly convenient, though their shared curse creates adequate pressure for the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation through the ink pot and father's teaching creates consistent character logic, with the "wait actively" philosophy driving her negotiation tactics. The transformation from hiding to confronting agents shows earned growth, though some emotional beats feel slightly performative ("bitter, metallic, like blood"). Internal conflict between fear and determination plays out through concrete actions rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Althea's motivation to "collect textures of different times" remains abstract throughout; her internal state during the lamp's pulsing moment lacks embodied contradiction beyond trembling hands. The character functions more as a vessel for lyrical description than a person facing genuine internal conflict with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation crystallizes effectively through the death certificate discovery and his compulsive fragment-collecting, with genuine internal contradiction between accepting erasure and seeking truth. The final determination to "make them remember" feels earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("filtered reality differently") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and grounded in her identity as a myth-buster confronting an unsolvable riddle. Her internal conflict between logic and wonder plays out through concrete actions (playing the cello, interpreting the shell) with embodied tension. The final choice to embrace feeling over decoding shows earned transformation, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("gloomy cheerfulness," "bittersweet thrill") rather than fully embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal tension, though her tactical shifts feel somewhat predictable. The stone chip functions as both tactile anchor and emotional weight, grounding her divided loyalty. Her final stance crystallizes with visible cost—the carnival's future remains uncertain but she's chosen her side.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's purposeful curiosity drives concrete micro-choices (placing the vial, timing the dissolution, capturing the photograph) with embodied emotion ("breath fogged the visor"). The character remains consistently motivated through melancholic acceptance rather than active struggle, though internal contradiction could deepen beyond wistfulness versus duty.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira's blindness paired with her unique perception method creates genuine character specificity, and her internal confidence despite Marlow's validation shows earned self-knowledge. The "listening as seeing" metaphor lands with thematic weight. Minor deduction for some explanatory interiority ("she'd learned to 'see' by touch") that tells rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's motivation to find where rivers begin—their "reasons"—drives concrete choices from testing salinity to chipping at glowing ice. Her dry wit ("Only if the rivers stop flowing") and subtle confidence manifest in specific actions. The transformation from believing "maps are promises" to "maps are lies" shows earned change through embodied discovery, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("knowing" as a concept).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation as a "cryptic bell tuner" who believes in revival through patience is clear and consistent. His methodical approach—using the tuning fork to rebuild through rhythm rather than force—demonstrates character-specific problem-solving. The internal consistency holds, though the townsfolk's arrival and transformation feels slightly convenient without showing their individual costs or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" drives credible choices under pressure, with internal conflict between smashing the vial vs. patience showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to release rather than trap the memories earns its reversal through prior causality. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("collective grief") and the abstract phrasing of "lonesome splendor of release."

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to escape his father's legacy of lies is clear and drives his navigation of the labyrinth. The encounter with his double and the final acceptance of writing over running shows earned character progression. However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("thread a labyrinth with his own story") rather than embodied emotion, and the father-ghost relationship lacks specific biographical grounding that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ghost bride's motivation is layered and specific—betrayal, curse, eternal binding—with contradictory impulses of grief and gratitude acting simultaneously. The final choice to free both herself and her betrayer carries visible cost through centuries of suffering. Deduction for some expository interiority in the middle section that tells rather than embodies the emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to restore through thread rather than chisel is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (raw fingers, humming to make thread glow). The sleepwalker encounter and final transformation show earned change through accumulating particulars. Minor deduction for the sleepwalker's underutilization and some abstract phrasing ("ghost of hope").

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and grounded in cultural restoration, with concrete embodied moments like "heart racing" and "breath catching." The internal tension between belief and skepticism ("didn't fully believe them—not yet") creates authentic complexity. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution of choosing faith without more visceral internal struggle at that pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation crystallizes from personal mystery to inherited mission with embodied tension ("fingers trembled," "tears blurred"). The arc from solitary decoder to community teacher shows genuine transformation with visible cost—her grandmother's decades of absence. Internal conflict between chasing ghosts and finding purpose resolves through concrete discovery, though some emotional beats lean toward summary ("Tears blurred Lira's vision").

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Zara's motivation is clear - preserving truth through coded embroidery - with concrete embodiment through trembling fingers and strategic foolishness. The internal contradiction between appearing decorative while encoding rebellion works. However, Jaxon's sudden understanding feels slightly unearned, and some emotional beats rely on abstract statements ("the truth is never a straight line") rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like placing the shard and tracing condensation letters. The shift from seeking to "evoke those words" to carrying them "not as regrets, but as reminders" shows earned change. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene - her journey feels too emotionally linear without meaningful resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus personal ache—act simultaneously through her translation choices ("He loved the silence between waves"). The final choice to bring coral to negotiations is earned through prior causality, though the general's response feels slightly convenient. Strong embodied emotion through the "lotus-hearted ache" and concrete micro-choices reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to rediscover lost joy drives concrete choices throughout, from displaying the fragment to creating the light-mural gathering. Her internal shift from "quiet elegies" to fighting back with "stubborn, glorious joy" is earned through specific experience with the community response. The embodied reactions—fingers itching, chest tight, hands trembling—avoid stock gestures while tracking emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marisol's methodical playfulness and inherited curiosity create consistent motivation, with embodied tension when she clutches the nickel and whispers to the mural. The grandfather connection provides emotional grounding, though internal conflict could deepen beyond curiosity versus certainty. Her micro-choices—positioning the dish, adjusting angles—reveal character through action under the story's unique pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—crashing lectures, decoding phrases, releasing pheromones—with his "stand guard over your own spark of defiance" line revealing layered purpose. The ensemble of masked figures and Lillian's selective gatekeeping create genuine pressure, though internal contradiction remains somewhat abstract rather than embodied in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's centuries-long insomnia and compulsive poetry-writing establish clear motivation, with embodied exhaustion ("hands trembling as if the paper itself might dissolve"). The transformation from isolation to offering shows genuine change with cost—she releases her poems to the wind rather than hoarding them. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "photosynthesize pain into beauty" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—her "chest tightened" at the director's pronouncement, her ritualistic dismantling of the chime. The contradiction between duty to preserve and need to evolve plays out through concrete choices, particularly when she chooses to sing rather than replace, earning the final insight that "preservation wasn't about freezing time."

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - her meticulous translation work mirrors her careful approach to rebuilding trust. The parallel between decoding dead languages and decoding her own silence works well. However, the epiphany about languages as "symphonies of truth" arrives somewhat abstractly in paragraph 3, and the final reconciliation feels slightly rushed given the years of estrangement described.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's characterization succeeds through concrete details (adjusting goggles, fingers brushing the chain) and her dual nature as machinist/cryptographer manifests in action. The internal tension between "precision of machinery and chaos of human emotion" drives authentic conflict. However, the emotional arc feels slightly predetermined, and the final revelation lacks the visceral cost needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete details (trembling fingers, grandfather's faked data) and his final choice to deliver as "a son" rather than courier shows earned transformation. However, the internal conflict between caution and curiosity lacks simultaneous tension in scene - it's stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting at once.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation emerges clearly through concrete details like tracing wood grain and decoding her father's logbook, with her transformation from "fugitive" to "cartographer of necessary distances" earning its weight. The internal conflict between searching and letting go manifests in embodied choices, though some moments drift toward abstraction ("featherly determined" reads more as authorial insertion than lived character trait).

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's characterization centers on her belief in "rhythm of belonging," driving her to share the alignment experience. Her motivation is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during the key moment. The burnt feather serves as a concrete anchor to her past, though her emotional progression feels somewhat smooth rather than layered with genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "Her skin shimmered like tide-washed sand." The transliteration of emotions into physical sensations ("It felt like regret...like molasses left too long in the sun") shows specific characterization. However, the final realization about paths being "released" rather than forgotten feels somewhat unearned—there's insufficient dramatized struggle leading to this insight, and internal contradiction is told rather than shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's analytical nature drives her musical orchestration of crowd movement, with clear motivation to "serenade monotony with creativity." The chess bishop becomes a physical anchor for her strategic mindset. However, internal contradiction is limited to observation rather than conflicting impulses, and the teen character lacks depth beyond serving as validation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation to renew her fading constellations through forbidden dance is clear and embodied through concrete action. The internal tension between needing to "fledge" (abandon) and "anchor" (root) creates genuine contradiction. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract—we feel the ritualistic necessity but not the visceral cost of her fading marks or what she risks beyond vague "madness."

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her contemplative nature fits the glazier profession, with concrete embodied details like "hands, calloused from years" and physical sensations in the water. The internal journey from seeking to finding illumination in the mundane is earned through specific experience with the prism and ripples. However, the transformation lacks visible cost—she finds peace without sacrificing anything tangible, and no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in survivor's guilt, with concrete embodied emotion (helmet biting brow, throat tightening). The final acceptance/transformation is earned through the hourglass discovery and reflection sequence. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("translate his pain into something universal") and the epiphany feeling slightly too neat, though the cost of carrying trauma is visible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation as a "logical dreamer" who seeks equations for hope is clear and consistent, driving meaningful choices like the thread-weaving and balloon launches. The internal complexity of witnessing parallel versions of herself giving up creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "equations for hope" that could be more embodied, but the final choice to continue experimenting lands with visible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation to discover what walls dream about drives consistent choices throughout, with concrete embodied details like "throat tightened" and "legs unsteady." The transformation from seeking external dreams to understanding "the dreams were not separate from her own" feels earned through specific discoveries. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract epiphany about being "the map" without more embodied cost in that final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's motivation to reconnect with her dead sister through mirror-manipulation is grounded in the concrete detail of the borrowed heartbeat. Her "perceptively calm" demeanor while carrying profound grief shows believable contradiction. The final choice to walk away after achieving connection demonstrates earned acceptance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization achieves specificity through her ritualistic relationship with the clipboard and operatively gentle negotiation style, with embodied details like "hands... traced the edges of the clipboard." The internal motivation remains somewhat abstract ("to anchor ideals in practice") without deeper contradiction or cost until the final acknowledgment that "the price of redemption would never be fully paid," which arrives too late to generate character-driven pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The philanthropist's contradictory impulses—destruction for profit versus secret sentimentality for the extinct bird—act simultaneously throughout, creating genuine internal tension. His final act of release with the water vial shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, the character's broader moral complexity relies on summary ("Critics called him a monster; admirers, a visionary") rather than fully embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation to defy conformity is clear and drives her dance to unlock the sanctuary, with visible cost in her urgency and breathlessness. The character shows embodied emotion through her movements as "bodily poetic" expression, though internal contradiction could be stronger. Her final choice to carry the "harvest of echoes" as resistance shows earned change, but deeper psychological complexity would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his guilt over the compromised eulogy, driving his pursuit of ethical storytelling through subversive means. His internal conflict between artistic integrity and past compromises manifests concretely through the puppet show's execution. The transformation from complicit calligrapher to truth-seeking performer is earned, though some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("Stories are thieves") rather than fully embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to honor overlooked deaths is clear and consistent, but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted existence") rather than embodied emotion. The final choice to continue her work shows credible endurance but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she never wavers or considers alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and rooted in personal loss (his mother Lira), with embodied details like trembling scarred hands. The final choice to illuminate memory through light rather than fire shows earned transformation. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat compressed, and internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene rather than summarized ("after forgiving himself").

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her "precisely playful" nature manifests through concrete actions like tracing the seal and interpreting dreams. The character shows genuine complexity in seeing "foresight and hindsight as twin lenses," though the final transformation feels somewhat abstract rather than embodied. Internal conflict operates through her navigation between "order and chaos," but peak emotional moments rely on conceptual language ("radiant point") rather than visceral embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's frugality-as-armor motivation is consistent and drives her choices, particularly in "counting coppers now wielding a relic." The internal arc from skepticism to acceptance of mystery lands with earned cost ("Some truths were too vast for telescopes"). However, the disembodied voice lacks embodied presence, and Elara's quick acceptance of the mystical elements feels slightly unearned given her established pragmatism.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael's pacifist nature creates internal consistency and her motivation to teach release is clear, but the visitor interactions feel templated with similar emotional arcs. The "cellular memory extract" concept lacks embodied grounding—we never see how it physically affects anyone beyond vague "feeling." The protagonist makes choices but they're repetitive rituals rather than escalating decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is grounded in his craft and deepens through synchronized breathing with the stranger, creating genuine collaboration. The choice to help capture a runaway dream emerges naturally from his maker's sensibility. Minor deduction for the stranger's relatively thin characterization beyond urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing, mending), with the hair ribbon as a physical anchor to her promise. However, the internal conflict remains somewhat abstract - we see determination but not contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation at the end (orchard blooming) feels slightly unearned by the specific mending action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's obsession with "hidden threads" and her conflicted relationship with the museum board establish clear motivation, though her emotional progression toward "quiet, brightened disquiet" feels slightly rushed. The transformation from bewilderment to acceptance lands with visible cost (choosing inheritance over institutional approval), but internal contradictions could act more simultaneously rather than sequentially.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in professional expertise, with concrete embodied moments like "fingers brushing the botanical diary." The "carefully resourceful" trait manifests through counter-charms and puzzle-solving. However, internal conflict remains largely intellectual rather than visceral, and the guardian negotiation lacks genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong dual-protagonist characterization with Lira and Veyra's symbiotic tension driving choices throughout. The sisters' contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene (skepticism vs. belief), and their final choice to plant their own name carries visible cost—abandoning the ship and their past. Minor deduction for some expository interiority ("Aberrant was her middle name") that tells rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to "translate chaos into order" drives concrete choices through the door puzzle, with her methodical approach embodied in the rope-weaving sequence. The transformation from archivist to "weaver of timelines" feels slightly rushed in the final beat, though her core trait of scholarly persistence remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing frost ridges and pressing the echo chamber stone to ice. Her internal state manifests physically ("ribs ache," "teeth ached") under the energy beings' assault. The final choice to embrace "quiet within" noise rather than banish it entirely shows earned wisdom, though some interior moments lean toward abstraction ("drowning in velvet").

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's retrocognitive gift creates genuine internal conflict between past visions and present despair, with embodied emotional progression through bleeding fingers and bone-deep vibrations. The final choice to train new custodians shows earned transformation from solitary hope to communal rebuilding, though some passages lean toward emotional summary ("gaunt and wary") rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's transformation from passive archivist to active participant in memory is earned through concrete micro-choices (descending to the forecourt, measuring shadows, listening to crystal vibrations). Her preemptive nostalgia manifests in specific embodied moments like "ache for moments before they faded." The closure choice to see herself as "living part of" memories rather than just keeper shows genuine change with implied cost of releasing control.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's guilt over the pavilion fire creates genuine internal conflict that drives her quest for redemption through the fortress's mysteries. The final choice to embrace becoming fire shows earned transformation with visible cost, though some emotional transitions (the "raw and unfamiliar" laugh) feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as chronicler is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "fingers traced the water's edge, feeling the pulse of the world." The internal conflict between observation and connection plays out through specific choices, though the resolution feels slightly too neat. The jade cicada repositioning and her tangential approach to reconciliation show character-specific problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila's motivation to "collect the flavors of different silences" is specific and embodied through sensory detail ("metallic, clanging" vs "honey and old wood"). The loss of the doll creates genuine cost, though the epiphany about "sprouting new ways of being" edges toward therapy-speak. Internal conflict between claustrophobia and yearning for the trellis drives authentic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" is concrete and embodied through her methodical monitoring with the storm glass. Her internal shift from wanting to teach silence to realizing she needs to listen to it earns the closure, though the epiphany arrives somewhat smoothly without sufficient struggle or contradiction in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing the ruby flake, pressing harder on murals), with her "wisely adventurous" paradox shown through studying prophecies while advancing despite fear. The guardian encounter provides genuine challenge, but the resolution through self-recognition feels somewhat convenient without sufficient prior causality establishing why she specifically was meant for this throne.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between isolation and connection drives genuine tension, with her decision to reach out representing a meaningful reversal earned through embodied emptiness ("weight that pressed against her chest"). The cost of reconnection is visible in her trembling hands and Kael's measured wariness. However, Kael remains underdeveloped beyond his function as catalyst, and some emotional transitions feel compressed rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's transformation from pyramid scheme survivor to resilient mycologist is well-established with concrete embodied reactions (respirator fogging, fingers brushing the bolt), though her internal conflict during the critical choice feels underdeveloped. The "virtuously mischievous" trait manifests in her rule-bending to survive but lacks deeper contradiction in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's deathbed secret, with concrete embodied details like "fingers tracing the rim" and "tremor in her chest." The final choice to honor her ancestors' sacrifice by "building something new" is earned through prior causality. However, the emotional progression feels slightly rushed in the transition from discovery to acceptance, and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("bridge of intuition") rather than fully embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cedric's journey from traumatized silence to transformative understanding is tracked through concrete choices (examining the program, unsnapping strings, descending), though internal contradiction could be more visceral in-scene. The final transformation pays visible cost as he dissolves his armored identity, but peak moments lean toward abstract ("Reality shifted") rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's characterization is grounded in specific history (emancipation, decades of archival work) with clear emotional stakes tied to being "unwanted." His progression from cataloging to active investigation shows agency, though internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than told ("tactfully hopeful"). The final choice to create a new folder represents meaningful action with implicit cost (acknowledging unknowability).

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history (father's key, slum origins), with embodied stress ("breath fogged," "heart pounded"). The final choice to distribute evidence shows agency with implied cost, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during action beats. Her competence balances with genuine risk during the underwater escape.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "hush a prophecy" is clear and rooted in his grandmother's deathbed warning, with embodied tension in his cold saxophone and burning lungs. The figure's dissolution represents a credible endurance/renunciation with visible cost ("lungs burning"), though the internal contradiction between fear and duty could be more actively dramatized in scene rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elinor's motivation is clear and rooted in her orderly nature, with concrete embodied actions (calloused hands, precise sorting). The transformation from skeptic to believer feels earned through specific experience with the moonstone dust. However, internal conflict remains largely implicit rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the emotional progression toward "mossy delight" could use more embodied complexity beyond the smile.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in obsession with finding truth through the compass, and his internal struggle between imposing order and accepting uncertainty creates genuine character tension. The transformation from rigid clock-fixer to embracing randomness feels earned through his physical journey. However, some interior moments lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("uncertainly certain" as explicit thought) rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and grounded in loss, with concrete embodied details like "the ache in Kael's bones" and the coin "warming his palm." The spectral Lira interaction lands effectively, though her dialogue edges toward diagnostic clarity ("You've always been torn between logic and magic") that diminishes complexity at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and grounded in her role as soul collector, with concrete embodiment through physical details like clutching the crocodile's tooth. The spectral figure provides meaningful pressure that forces Lira to confront her fear that "laughter is not enough," earning the final realization about healing as pursuit. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("luminous ache of hope").

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's trauma-survivor status drives consistent embodied responses (proprioceptive awareness, pewter strap grip) that culminate in his choice to "brace" and walk deeper. The woman's appearance feels slightly convenient, but her function as catalyst for his self-recognition ("Then remember through the trauma") lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like "chest tightened" and the tactile memory of the lighthouse beam. The final choice to reclaim the fragment carries visible cost through the "sharp yet soft" edges and the weight of drowned worlds. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("between-worlds translator who parsed whispers") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to listen to ghosts and repair their stories is clear and drives the discovery, but the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "weightless burden" metaphor carries some embodied emotion, though peak moments lean toward summary ("his chest tight with the weightless burden of understanding"). The final choice to repair stories alongside the elevator shows consistent character logic with implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "rupture the library's delicate equilibrium" is clear and consistent, driving her methodical actions toward the climactic transformation. The internal logic holds—she believes compression creates awakening—though her deeper emotional stakes remain abstract. The final choice to step into the storm shows earned renunciation with visible cost (abandoning her press/role).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation burns consistently through archaeological obsession replacing revolutionary fervor, with his plan to cover mirrors embodying both poetic logic and desperate ingenuity. The fungal revelation creates genuine discovery under pressure. However, internal contradiction could be more embodied during peak moments rather than summarized ("his voice burnished with sorrow").

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation through craft-as-truth philosophy drives his choices consistently, and Lira's admission creates genuine cost when she confronts her husband's lies. The covenant's philosophy of "mending what isn't torn" effectively externalizes internal conflict. However, both characters lean toward archetype (wise craftsman, grieving widow) without sufficient individuation, and Lira's transformation feels slightly rushed given the story's philosophical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's obsessive collecting and psychometry abilities create genuine internal tension between scientific curiosity and confronting the unknowable, with her final hunger for more mysteries showing earned character evolution. The "sensibly eccentric" trait drives actual choices rather than existing as a label, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("she understood now").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her sculptor identity shapes perception, but the transformation from artist to "weaver of timelines" lacks embodied struggle—she accepts this monumental shift without internal resistance. The "perpetually learning brain" trait appears as a label without constraining choices or creating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's obsession with her grandmother's cryptic legacy drives consistent motivation throughout. The internal contradiction between her public art and private quest creates genuine tension. However, the revelation lacks full embodied cost - we see intellectual understanding but limited emotional price for this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's retrocognitive gift creates genuine internal conflict as she loses herself in others' memories, with the cost viscerally shown through tears and fraying identity. The choice to trigger the chamber collapse demonstrates agency under pressure, though Elara's ghost feels more like a plot device than a fully realized pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to revive the cove is clear and consistent, driving his methodical work through memory reconstruction. The internal arc from hollow vessel to tear-filled witness works, though the transformation lacks embodied struggle in middle beats. His "fierce" burning motivation is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elder Voss's motivation to archive emotional patterns drives clear choices throughout, with embodied tension in "trembling fingers" and "spine tighten." The internal conflict between understanding the prophecy and accepting its implications creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution lacks a decisive personal cost—he simply accepts his role as listener without visible sacrifice or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's "furiously tranquil" mindset manifests through precise action amid chaos, and her motivation to "discover the texture of borrowed time" drives concrete choices. The internal contradiction of acting with precision while "riding the edge of chaos" creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the vortex inheritance concept initially, though it gains specificity through action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's curiosity drives consistent micro-choices (testing bells, exploring secondary rope, creating rhythmic patterns), and her humble nature resists praise authentically. The transition from disrupting to harmonizing storms shows earned change through specific embodied actions. However, Veyra's presence feels convenient and her dialogue edges toward thematic echo ("favoring listening over noise"), and emotional complexity during the crisis moment lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Zara's motivation—finding strength in vulnerability through empathizing with falling stars—drives consistent choices from observation deck to crater. Her internal contradiction between scientific duty and spiritual seeking manifests in embodied actions (walking with "primal elegance," kneeling at the crater). The final choice to preserve stardust shows earned wisdom through concrete experience, though Veyra's transformation feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's motivation to preserve unspoken words drives meaningful action, culminating in his choice to break decades of silence. The internal contradiction between preserving silence and the need to speak creates authentic tension. Deduction for the somewhat abstract epiphany about the "tangled covenant" which edges toward diagnostic understanding rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to rediscover time's texture after clocks fail is clear and drives concrete action. His internal conflict between banker-past and timekeeper-present manifests through specific gestures (adjusting frayed cufflinks) and the carried urn fragment. The final renunciation of numerical time for mosaic-time shows earned change, though some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing ("timelessness wasn't an absence of time—it was a layering") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to harmonize discord through art is clear and consistent, with embodied details like tracing the feather's barbs "as if reading a map." The internal philosophy drives concrete actions, though the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract—we understand her artistic practice but not the personal cost or urgency behind it.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation to heal the temple through symbiotic architecture is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (tracing runes, winding copper). Her acceptance of mortality drives meaningful choices with visible cost. However, the spirit character lacks depth beyond symbolic presence, and some emotional beats rely on declaration ("brazen calm") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's skepticism-to-obsession arc lands with earned complexity through the amber catalyst moment. The contradictory impulses between academic rebellion and desperate searching for belonging play out in scene. Minor deduction for Kael's slightly convenient wisdom-dispensing role without sufficient pressure on her own stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coachman's transformation from soldier to gardener carries genuine weight, with his motivation rooted in the reef's death and his belief in "submerged concord." His micro-choices (scattering seeds, mixing fertilizer, listening to birds) reveal consistent values. The internal complexity of hope amid ruin lands effectively, though some passages lean toward therapeutic clarity ("Time was a language he'd learned to speak fluently").

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Hush's motivation to "translate distance into closeness" manifests through concrete riddle-solving actions, and her transformation from death-finder to connection-builder lands with earned resonance. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or struggle during the riddle-solving sequences—she solves each one with immediate intuition rather than dramatized difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elio's motivation is clear and rooted in his exile for ethical questioning, with his confusion-to-exploration arc earning its payoff through the grandmother's apparition and his final choice to trust uncertainty. The internal conflict between isolation and connection plays out concretely when he clutches the compass and chooses the nonsensical path. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final beats, and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("adriftness was a kind of freedom") rather than fully embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—stealing to restore balance—with concrete embodied details like breath fogging and hair standing on end. The internal conflict between his thief identity and "guardian of wonder" role provides genuine complexity. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("apprentice of wonder" feels labeled) and the final transformation to "guardian" lacks sufficient on-page struggle to fully earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodiment—her scars, her practiced grief, her walking pattern—though the internal contradiction between performance and truth could push harder in scene. The final realization that she is "the pawn, the king, the board itself" lands with earned weight, but some interiority edges toward abstraction ("benevolently ruthless" reads more as label than embodied trait).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's mercury-glass nature creates a compelling metaphor for memory absorption, with genuine internal conflict between forgetting's pain and remembering's burden. The transformation from avoidance to acceptance feels earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the shape of home") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alaric's guilt and need for redemption drive consistent choices through the tapestry interaction and thread selection. The black thread triggering his memory of failure and his final acceptance that "some threads couldn't be untangled—only woven into something new" shows earned internal change with visible cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of his forgiveness process.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's defiant artistry and belief in refracting truth drives clear, escalating choices from painting "Forgive" to disrupting the ritual. His internal consistency holds through pressure, though the epiphany about forgiveness as courage feels slightly unearned. The final transformation from heretic to "artist who'd finally learned how to see" lands with modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's uncertainty and alchemical incompetence drive genuine internal conflict through embodied details like trembling hands and the burned breath. The progression from self-doubt to acceptance of imperfection ("Kintsugi isn't about perfection. It's about *surviving*") is earned through concrete struggle with the charm and statue, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak ("Redemption? Answers?").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in artistic restlessness, with embodied details like "fingers smudged with salt and pigment." The internal conflict between holding onto permanence and accepting transience plays out through concrete choices. However, the mother's apparition feels unearned, and "intimately aloof" reads as a label rather than demonstrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete particulars: the stolen vial cork, her theory about whispers versus shouts rooted in parental grief/rage, and the embodied hum building in her chest. The contradiction between her need to be heard and her method of whispering creates authentic tension, though Thalos's instant belief strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—building the antenna with hair, scrap metal, and the censer foot. Her internal conflict between loss and hope manifests in physical labor and tears. The "patchwork navigator" identity effectively merges role with character, though some emotional beats rely on abstract declarations ("geography of loss") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her methodical nature consistent, but internal contradiction lacks simultaneous presence in scene - her rationalism vs. belief in the eye's power is told rather than embodied. The final choice to "occlude with truth" feels earned but the emotional cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation through borrowed memories and his wife's disappearance creates genuine internal conflict, particularly in "I've carried enough." The woman's pain over stolen memories of her daughter lands with embodied grief. Minor deduction for the captain's motivation remaining somewhat abstract despite the journal confession.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila's motivation is clear and builds from loneliness through curiosity to self-confrontation, with embodied details like "heartbeat syncing with the drip of water." The vision sequence with her father creates genuine emotional complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of "cartographer of her own heart" lacking full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's disenchantment and fear are embodied through concrete actions (tracing cold stone, climbing despite danger), and her internal conflict between ruling and feeling creates genuine tension. However, the epiphany with the light-being veers into diagnostic label-speak ("afraid to rule, afraid to love, afraid to fail") that undermines the earned complexity of her earlier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—deciphering light as language to save the nexus—with concrete embodied details like "hands steady" and specific flaws in her obsessive pursuit. The relationship with Jorin serves as crucible for her realization about perspective-mixing. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("scientifically romantic") and the epiphany about "letting it guide" feels slightly unearned despite the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to escape chaos and chronicle dreams is clear, with strong interiority through "feral nostalgia" and embodied jealousy of past selves. The final realization that "I wasn't trapped in the past; I was *building* it" represents genuine character evolution with earned wisdom. Deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("jaded wonder," "bittersweet clarity") rather than fully embodied states, and the epiphany arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient dramatized struggle in the cave scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's synesthetic compensation for lost smell—reading emotional terrain through objects—creates genuine complexity. The internal contradiction between her former aromatherapist identity and current reliance on tactile/visual cues drives authentic choices. However, Mrs. Voss remains more functional than fully realized, and some interiority veers toward explanatory ("mapping their emotional terrain") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's internal journey from fear to acceptance is embodied through concrete details (trembling hands, itching scars, crystallizing ink). The transformation of scars into readable symbols provides visible cost and change. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("to transform them into stories") that could have remained implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation as "gossip-column exorcist" who deals in "half-truths and whispered scandals" is clear and distinctive. Elias's guilt-driven need to reconnect with his dead sister provides emotional weight. However, Clara's quick acceptance of the supernatural reconnection lacks internal conflict, and her transition from skeptic to believer feels unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Witness's motivation to "unravel cosmic illusions" drives consistent action, but interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musings ("truth was not a destination but a continuous process") rather than embodied emotion. The journey inward/outward paradox creates some tension, yet the character lacks specific flaws or contradictions that would generate authentic struggle. The final renunciation (accepting mystery over solving) carries conceptual weight but minimal emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lorn's internal journey from mechanical time-keeper to philosophical seeker is well-embodied through concrete actions like the counting ritual and key examination. The final realization about clocks measuring "longing" feels earned through accumulated sensory detail, though the epiphany borders on over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation to understand "the physics of surrender" drives meaningful choices, particularly when he shifts from analysis to trust. The internal conflict between control and letting go manifests concretely through his interaction with the barrier system. Minor deduction for Lira's underdeveloped presence despite her role in the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara's gambling compulsion creates genuine internal contradiction (craving chaos vs. swearing off casinos), and her final choice to visit her father shows earned change through the subway journey. The character-specific detail of seeking patterns in strangers' scrawls effectively embodies her need for "contradictions you can hold." Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract epiphany about contradictions as mirrors rather than fully embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's characterization succeeds through her philosophy of "cultivated estrangement" embodied in concrete actions, though her internal conflict remains understated. The final choice to let the disc "spin freely" demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost—she releases control after orchestrating connections all night.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in family legacy, with concrete embodied moments like "fingers tracing the edges" and "brushing sand from her knees." However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene - her doubts about the photo remain abstract rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's desperation and skepticism create genuine internal tension, particularly in "Ghosts don't eat rocks. They eat regrets." The final shift from jocularity-as-shield to jocularity-as-bridge shows earned character movement with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to follow his mother's ghost melody is clear and embodied through tactile sensation. The contradiction between his blindness and mapmaking profession creates inherent tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where his mother appears "as memory made flesh" without sufficient grounding in the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's guilt-driven motivation is clear and embodied through physical reactions (teeth aching, throat tightening). The shift from controlling editor to collaborative witness earns its cost through the farmer's daughter's fever and his confrontation with unintended consequences. Internal contradiction between his certainty in skills and the chaos unleashed plays out concretely, though Lira's characterization remains more functional than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his inherited role, with concrete embodiment through his signing and the camera ritual. The transformation from individual silence-mapping to collective music-making shows genuine progression. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract - we understand his purpose intellectually but don't feel the personal cost of his isolation or the weight of being forgotten.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation layers effectively through the grandmother's promise and her role as "translator" rather than destroyer. The moment where she recognizes her grandmother's face in the healing portrait lands with genuine emotional weight. However, the "analytically intuitive" trait feels more labeled than embodied in specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's motivation to understand his connection to the lagoon drives concrete choices, particularly in the drumming climax. However, the sudden POV shift to first-person ("made my chest ache," "I asked") breaks consistency and undermines character coherence. The experimental treatment scars and "quietly rebellious" nature manifest through specific actions like climbing and drumming, though the female character remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to prove "whispers travel farther than shouts" drives consistent choices through the labyrinth, with embodied stress (trembling hands, breath hitching). The final choice to hum rather than answer shows earned character consistency. However, internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the epiphany about the labyrinth's listening nature arrives without sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's characterization achieves consistency through her "spiralingly calm" attribute and silent guardian role, with clear motivation ("to teach darkness the value of stars"). However, the piece lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle—she performs her ritual without facing meaningful resistance or cost, and her perfect serenity never wavers under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's ability to hear unspoken words drives concrete choices throughout, particularly in her chess teaching and grotto interactions. The contradiction between Lila's spoken guardedness and her screaming internal need ("I need to know how to win") creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("quiet rebellion," "fading spirit") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to escape crystallizes through embodied details (boots sinking, muscles coiled) and the scrimshaw's generational weight drives her decisive act. However, the transformation from skeptic to believer feels rushed without sufficient internal contradiction shown in scene, and the "someone new—someone free" resolution lacks specificity about what freedom costs her beyond leaving.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael's blank affect and ritualized performance effectively embody grief under oppression, with concrete micro-choices (whittling methodically, touching dried petals) revealing character through action. The internal contradiction between enforced emptiness and persistent creation drives authentic tension, though some passages lean toward thematic articulation ("Lightness is not the absence of darkness") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her aesthetic drive shapes actions, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she experiences only wonder without genuine struggle. The final choice to step into the unknown lacks earned cost; we see transformation without resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's colorblindness driving his artistic obsession creates clear motivation, and the final choice to embrace imperfection shows earned change. However, the revelation about Marla's past with the phoenix feels abrupt without sufficient groundwork, and some emotional transitions (particularly Elias's instant acceptance of magic) lack the contradictory impulses that would make them feel lived.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her "powerfully gentle" approach manifests through questioning rather than force, with good embodied moments like fingers dancing across the console. The character arc from seeking to discovering the texture of connection lands, though the epiphany about connection being "a symphony of contradictions" edges toward abstraction without sufficient embodied cost in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's grief-driven motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like bleeding fingers and the pendant worn close to heart. The internal conflict between atonement and renewal plays out through specific actions rather than abstractions. However, the transformation from "hollowed shadow" to steady hands feels slightly rushed without sufficient intermediate struggle, and some emotional transitions rely on telling ("subdued thrill") rather than embodied showing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as cartomancer-analyst is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "measuring tape coiled beside her like a silver serpent." The transformation from data analyst to cartomancer following crypto crashes provides solid causality. However, internal conflict remains somewhat abstract ("steadily curious" trait tells more than shows), and Mara's arc feels rushed without sufficient pressure to earn her conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael's motivation to "dissect" and "purify" the past drives concrete choices, particularly her defiance of the elders' prohibition and her physical interaction with the pagoda. The internal conflict between pursuing dangerous knowledge and avoiding patterns creates genuine tension. However, Kael remains functionally thin, serving primarily as exposition delivery, and the final transformation ("she didn't try to shake them off") feels somewhat unearned given the limited dramatization of her prior pattern-avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's characterization succeeds through her methodical investigation and careful withholding of information from the council, showing agency under pressure. The choice to speak "Bloom" carries weight, though the emotional stakes could be more viscerally embodied - we get "sharp eyes wet with tears" but limited internal contradiction during the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira's internal conflict between maintaining compassion versus shedding vulnerability is embodied through concrete actions (reconstructing the tail, working with delicate tools) rather than abstract statements. The betrayal's impact on her "fragile convictions" drives meaningful change, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("Compassion's a liability"). The final choice to reclaim softness as strength lands with visible cost—she's shed protective layers but gained clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to decode her mother's death is clear and embodied through the scar's physical aching. The telepathic plant connection feels ornamental rather than character-essential. Her transformation from seeking closure to finding "the ability to read stories in scars" lands but arrives through convenient visions rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's letters, with concrete embodied perception through psychometry. The internal conflict between seeking and fearing what she'll find plays out through specific actions. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("spatial imagination" feels explained rather than shown) and the resolution feeling slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation burns with specificity—the sextant as compass to unspoken words, his mind humming with "half-formed symphonies." The discovery of preserved stardust jars labeled with creative acts ("The Singer's First Note") drives a genuine transformation, though the resolution toward "ideas, each one a star waiting to fall" edges toward convenient epiphany without fully embodying the cost of newfound creative freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's dreamlessness creates genuine internal contradiction when he finally dreams, earning the closure with visible transformation. The woman character lacks depth beyond her functional role. Motivation clarity suffers slightly from abstract concepts ("cultivate sparks") but embodied details (boots sinking, chest aching) ground the emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to find her father and understand the forest drives consistent choices through discovery. The sixth sense and sleep translocation create concrete constraints that shape her actions. Her final choice to plant the gear seed shows earned renunciation with visible cost—letting go of her father's keepsake to preserve the wild frontier.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characters show clear motivation through the generational duty and vigil concept, with Lira's wisdom contrasting Jorin's uncertainty effectively. The "courage as river" philosophy and stamped tickets as choices demonstrate strong thematic integration. However, the resolution lacks visceral embodiment—emotions remain somewhat abstract rather than felt through specific physical details, and Jorin's transformation feels slightly rushed without sufficient internal contradiction shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elric's transformation from enforced silence to finding voice carries genuine weight, with his internal conflict between contract and conscience playing out through concrete actions. The moment where his footsteps echo "for the first time" effectively embodies change. Minor deduction for Lady Veyra's somewhat stock fury and the slightly abstract framing of motivation early on.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and drives the entire narrative arc, with her "star trapped in her chest" desire creating consistent pressure. The character shows determination through concrete actions (deciphering messages, navigating the temple's secrets) rather than declaration. However, internal contradiction and embodied emotion under peak stress are underdeveloped—we get purposeful movement but limited visceral experience of her centuries of preparation meeting this singular moment.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira's tapping rhythm as a coping mechanism and way to "map invisible cracks" provides concrete character specificity, and her obsessive pursuit despite Kael's dismissal shows clear motivation. However, the transformation from scientific observation to mystical journey feels unmotivated—the leap to following bioluminescent coordinates lacks the internal conflict or earned causality such a drastic choice demands.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's "awkwardly confident" trait manifests concretely through her actions and dialogue ("madness is just clarity without a filter"). Her motivation to find meaning drives the discovery of the stones' purpose, and her final choice to activate them shows earned agency with visible collective cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nana Marisol's characterization succeeds through concrete particulars - her telepathic plant connection drives the central action of decoding the script, and her insurgent past credibly motivates her final choice. The embodied details ("hands trembled," "knuckles scratching") ground her in scene. Deduction for slight convenience in how easily she accepts and acts on the plants' cryptic instructions without more internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila's motivation through grief and PTSD is clear and embodied through concrete actions like the photograph ritual and somatic grounding exercises. The internal conflict between holding onto trauma versus finding peace plays out through micro-choices, though Mrs. Voss's wisdom occasionally veers toward therapy-speak ("Your body remembers what your mind tries to forget"). The final choice to anchor optimism feels earned through the accumulated somatic work.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation as a "crestfallen portrait artist" drives consistent choices from cataloging to painting to weaving threads. His internal conflict between imposing order and accepting fragmentation plays out through concrete actions. The transformation from despair to creative renewal earns its cost through accumulated detail, though some interiority relies on rhetorical questions rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is concrete and embodied through her brother's erasure during the last eclipse, driving consistent choices. The "serene anger" manifests believably through controlled actions rather than labels. Minor deduction for the child character appearing late without sufficient pressure on the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's internal conflict between archival duty and moral obligation drives genuine tension, though her transformation feels somewhat rushed. The "bravely conflicted heart" shows real ambiguity in her decision-making. However, Kael's awakening and immediate understanding lacks the embodied disorientation one would expect after a century of cryosleep, reducing authenticity at the crucial meeting point.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's characterization succeeds through concrete details (fingers on thorns, humming while planting) and her transformation from confusion about "quiet" to understanding it as focused presence. The internal progression from "the act had always confused her" to "Quiet, she whispered, not to the void but to the soil" shows earned insight through embodied action, though some passages drift toward abstract reflection without immediate sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's cool-headed focus and scientific-spiritual duality drive consistent choices through pressure, with his final acceptance of the goddess's dissolution showing earned renunciation with visible cost. The "voicing the right silence" paradox and years of meditation ground his capability, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with concrete internal conflict between loyalty and truth-seeking. The "devotedly observant" trait manifests through specific actions (mapping stars as escape, cross-referencing documents). However, the emotional progression feels compressed—the shift from shock to activism happens too quickly without sufficient embodied struggle, and some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("Orbits of regret still spun, but she'd learned to dance in their gravity").

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to confront her mother's guilt is earned through the amber discovery and personal backstory revelation, with genuine internal conflict visible when she trembles before entering the firmware. The cost of confronting childhood trauma lands clearly. However, Elara functions more as exposition vehicle than pressure source, and some emotional beats rely on abstraction ("guilt etched into her bones") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation crystallizes effectively from documentation to discovery, with concrete embodied actions (kneeling in moss, drawing mandalas) replacing emotional labels. The "unlearning isn't forgetting" mantra and her social perceptiveness create character specificity. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during key decisions, particularly when choosing to "interject."

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between gentleness and radical action manifests through concrete choices, particularly in the symbolic act of placing the tessera. The retrocognitive episodes effectively embody his emotional state and create genuine tension. However, the character transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and the "aberrant mercy" mantra borders on diagnostic self-awareness that weakens authenticity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's synesthetic perception creates a distinctive character lens, and his motivation to "lure possibility from the brink of despair" drives concrete action through producing echoes. The flapper woman's arrival and subsequent dance show earned change through accumulated pressure. Loses points for abstract phrasing like "possibility" and "threads of timeline" that lack embodied specificity in crisis moments.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (tracing the geode, mapping neural patterns), with genuine internal conflict between skepticism and hope. The somatic markers provide concrete embodiment of abstract concepts. However, Mara remains functional rather than fully realized, and the final "willowglass hope mirroring his" feels slightly convenient rather than earned through distinct characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's transformation from physical cartographer to emotional translator is earned through concrete interaction with the fossil, though some interiority veers toward abstract ("translator, a bridge between the seen and the unseen"). The fossil dissolution creating physical change (spores entering pores) provides embodied transformation. Internal contradiction between scientific method and mystical openness works well.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (sorting buttons, turning the hourglass), with her internal state filtering perception effectively. The transformation from seeking prophecy to embracing malleable possibility earns its cost through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("her mind a library of half-remembered tales").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation crystallizes through concrete particulars (father's pillbox, dream memory), and her internal conflict between paranoia and trust plays out in embodied hesitation at the bluff. The resolution—rekindling courage rather than finding answers—is earned through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("the cost of secrets—the way they festered").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thaddeus has clear traits (closely attentive, distilling complexity) but his motivation lacks urgency—the crossing feels routine rather than pressured. The yarn needle as a metaphor for his gift works conceptually but doesn't generate concrete conflict or choice. No meaningful change occurs; he simply completes another crossing while reflecting on his role.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's zen-minded potter identity manifests through her methodical approach and "mind like still water," with clear motivation driving exploration. The vision sequence effectively embodies contradictory impulses—her younger self's fierce well-digging versus current contemplative stance. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient self-recognition in shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" drives consistent choices throughout, and his patient cultivation of beauty in harsh spaces defines his character. The final choice to enter Mara's shop and open her window demonstrates agency with emotional cost. However, Mara remains underdeveloped beyond her grief label, and the transformation feels slightly unearned given the limited dramatization of their prior relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and drives her choices, particularly in her declaration "I see you...But I am not you." The character shows genuine internal conflict between connection to her extinct kin and need for autonomy. However, the transformation from passive observer to active writer feels somewhat unearned—the leap to documenting lacks sufficient causal pressure from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lila's motivation to reconnect after years of ghostwriting others' emotions is clear and consistent. Her internal contradiction between helping others express truth while hiding her own creates genuine tension. The final choice to write her secret and encourage truth-telling is earned, though the transformation feels somewhat swift for the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation is clear and her cautious hope manifests in concrete action (the subsonic frequency gambit). The tricksters remain abstract entities without embodied presence, and emotional responses lack specificity - "chest tight with relief" and "trembled" are stock rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's claustrophobia creates genuine internal tension against his adventurous drive, and his final choice to step through the gateway shows earned agency. However, the character lacks deeper contradiction beyond the claustrophobia/adventure binary, and emotional states feel somewhat performed ("wistful rebellion in his heart") rather than embodied through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's face-blindness forcing deeper perception methods creates genuine character specificity, and her motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" manifests through concrete artistic practice. The partnership dynamic with Voss shows believable professional tension. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional articulation ("lance the numbness") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clara's motivation to vindicate her ancestor is clear and consistent, driving her investigation through the archives. However, her internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score—she experiences nervousness but not genuine opposing desires. The "nervously confident" attribute appears as a label ("nervously confident smile faltered") rather than constraining choices with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation through his pursuit of understanding the pixelated flake and Marisol's disappearance, with concrete embodied actions (tuning fiddle, feeling warmth of flake). However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - he moves too smoothly from confusion to understanding without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to break cycles is clear, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we get reflection about his father's legacy but minimal present-moment struggle. The "polished calm" trait functions more as label than constraint. His final peace arrives without sufficient dramatized cost or struggle to earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and personal (missing brother), with concrete embodied emotion in her interaction with the prism and temple voices. The transformation from chronicler's detachment to empathic witness lands with visible cost. Loses points for some diagnostic language ("blurring realities," "healing begins with listening") and occasional emotional summary rather than embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between guardedness and the need to "unbend" creates genuine tension. The resolution where she accepts her capacity for violence feels earned through the vision sequence. However, the emotional progression relies on abstract statements ("her heart lighter") rather than embodied sensation, and the epiphany about self-defense versus guilt could use more concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation to reweave the covenant is clear and drives choices, with embodied details like scars tingling and burning. The golden-eyed double creates genuine internal conflict about surrendering humanity. However, the final transformation lacks sufficient embodied cost—scars vanishing into "glowing lines" feels unearned given the setup's emphasis on pain acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's reckless idealism drives meaningful choices with embodied cost—her palm on the skeleton's ribcage, stitching bones with "whispers of regret turned into resolve." The transformation from certainty to "fiercely gentle" wisdom feels earned through concrete action, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("always charging forward without looking back").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lenny's internal conflict between his past roadie identity and current appraiser role is well-established through concrete details like the grille cloth and his emotional insulation tactics. The final choice to resurrect forgotten stories shows earned transformation with visible cost. However, the epiphany "he'd found his purpose" arrives too neatly without sufficient embodied struggle in the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her methodical investigation of the seed. Her internal progression from academic curiosity to deeper understanding of transition-as-story feels earned. However, the transformation lacks embodied emotional complexity during key moments, particularly when the seed opens—her breath-holding reads as stock rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The librarian's identity fluidity with moon phases creates genuine internal contradiction, and the woman's transformation from scales to feathers shows embodied change with visible cost. However, the child's arrival feels perfunctory, and character-specific motivation for transformation ("I've always feared losing myself") lacks deeper grounding in lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (adjusting respirator, following the pearl's glow), with internal conflict shown through his hesitation before placing the pearl. The transformation from inspector to "conduit" feels earned through specific experience, though some emotional beats rely on abstract phrasing ("the ache of unspoken truths") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal conflict between mapping external rivers and navigating internal guilt creates genuine tension, with the medication cessation adding psychological complexity. The final choice to draw "a new kind of map: one of her heart" shows earned transformation through concrete action, though some interiority borders on therapy-speak ("festering beneath the surface").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her interiority shows consistent purpose, though internal conflict remains mostly told ("sharp and restless" eyes) rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The final discovery moment earns its resolution through prior pattern-seeking, but peak emotional complexity stays somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's internal conflict between empire and personal life crystallizes through concrete choices—touching the violin, reading coffee stains, ultimately dismantling the dream. The "mulberry ache" and plant telepathy create specific embodied states. However, the motivation for wanting the throne remains abstract ("rewrite the empire's creed"), weakening the stakes of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and embodied through precise actions—her trembling fingers, synchronized breathing with aurora pulses—though internal contradiction remains understated. The cost of her work manifests physically (exhaustion) and emotionally (finding "strange peace" in preserving echoes against oblivion). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of Elion's essence, which lists qualities rather than embodying them through specific memory.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing, touching the shell), and her internal shift from seeking answers to understanding contentment-as-practice feels earned. The sister relationship provides adequate pressure though Elara remains somewhat thin. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of "contentment as practice" lacking more visceral embodiment in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's "conscience for hire" profession creates a compelling contradiction between his role as doubt-merchant and his moment of genuine clarity-offering to Mira. The shift from "sincerely insincere" cynicism to authentic connection lands with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("terrifying. And exhilarating") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's backward aging creates genuine internal contradiction between her youthful curiosity and decades of wisdom, embodied through concrete details like silver hair and flickering eyes. The withholding of knowledge as pedagogical method shows character-specific complexity. Minor deduction for Lira's somewhat thin presence and the slightly abstract "glimmer of understanding" rather than more embodied revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in cultural tradition, with concrete embodied details like the warm arrowhead and his weathered resolve. The internal journey from seeking to understanding feels earned through accumulated detail. However, the epiphany about "alignment" and "becoming part of patterns" edges toward abstract resolution without sufficient embodied struggle in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's transformation from "underachieving mage" to someone who "felt like a mage who deserved the title" is earned through concrete discovery, though his internal contradictions could be more embodied during the journey. The mother's garden memory provides specific motivation that drives his final choice with visible emotional cost ("tears freezing on his cheeks").

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation coheres through concrete embodiment—the key burning against his thigh, his need to discover "the color of sound" rooted in Lila's final words. The internal contradiction between hiding behind duty and seeking ghosts plays out in action. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient epiphany about luminous vows, though the final renunciation lands with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's progression from doubt to clarity is earned through concrete discovery, with contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. curiosity) acting simultaneously. The final choice to become a conduit shows visible cost through physical transformation ("vibration beneath his skin"). However, internal conflict could be more embodied during the middle beats, relying too heavily on abstract processing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his failure with Lira, driving him to name nameless fears. His internal conflict between past failure and present purpose creates genuine tension, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The character makes meaningful micro-choices (using the prism, speaking aloud) that reveal his values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's earnest naivety drives consistent choices through the bell repair, though internal contradiction remains mostly told ("brittle devotion") rather than embodied in conflicting impulses. The final choice to persist despite imperfection lands with some cost ("brittle with exhaustion but warm with hope"), but the emotional progression feels somewhat tidy without genuine irrationality or self-deception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's vigilance evolves from professional duty to personal reckoning as the liqueur label triggers memory work, with her final choice to become a story guardian showing earned transformation. The mysterious woman (Elias's daughter) applies immediate pressure that forces Mara's stance crystallization. Minor deduction for the woman's somewhat convenient appearance and exposition-heavy dialogue ("He thought... if he could spin stories into shared meaning").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between logic and intuition drives concrete choices throughout, particularly in her decision to plunge her hand into flame to achieve synthesis. The contradiction acts simultaneously in scene through her father's equations meeting her mother's verse. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("to harmonize logic and intuition") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like pressing the buckle into nodes and feeling bark vibrations. The inherited duty from his vanished mother creates genuine stakes, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("She'd meant the forest, he knew, but also herself"). The final realization that "trust wasn't a burden—it was a language" shows earned understanding through struggle.

    Kael's motivation to defeat numbness is clear but relies on abstraction ("ego death," "emotional numbness"). The clone functions more as philosophical opposition than embodied character. The final merger feels conceptually tidy rather than emotionally costly - "his emotions raw but real" tells rather than embodies the change.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation as a puzzle-solver who embraces the unknown is clearly established, and his methodical investigation shows consistent character traits. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—he proceeds too smoothly from curiosity to action without genuine struggle. The transformation from seed-planter to key-finder feels earned through his "flow" approach, though the emotional cost of this realization remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlowe's motivation is clear and his mournfully eager personality manifests in concrete actions. The character shows genuine struggle through physical details (blistered palms, burning throat) and his dedication drives the story forward. However, the emotional arc relies on somewhat abstract concepts rather than sharp internal contradiction, and the transformation lacks the visceral cost that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivations crystallize through concrete choices—throwing the pendant away despite its personal connection, choosing uncertainty over power. Her "dimensionally homesick heart" and feral nature manifest in physical details (claws, bare feet) and her complex relationship with both worlds. The final renunciation carries visible cost as she destroys her only link to her childhood's mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's stoically sensitive nature manifests through concrete embodiment ("absorbed every failure...like a sponge soaking up poison") and drives his final sacrificial choice with visible cost (scarred hands, frayed mind). The internal conflict between paralysis and the need to interrupt destiny plays out through action rather than summary, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic clarity ("the bridge between chaos and order").

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation as a celestial interpreter seeking "the beginning in every ending" drives consistent choices through dismantling the tower's systems to access the hush. His mantra "discard assumptions" manifests in concrete actions, though internal conflict could be more embodied during the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation to complete the passengers' journeys emerges clearly through embodied details like "tears streaming down his face" and the concrete choice to broadcast the pattern despite knowing it could "unravel reality itself." The internal conflict between his "resiliently positive nature" and the weight of vanishing commuters creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional resolution where all passengers find their perfect outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation to prove "rational enchantment" drives consistent choices through weaving and persistence despite disorientation. The transformation from skepticism to acceptance feels earned through concrete experience. However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("texture of connection") rather than embodied emotion, and the epiphany lacks visceral cost despite the dramatic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael's motivation to find her place in "unfolded horizons" drives consistent choices, and her teaching methods reveal character through the chain link's metaphorical use. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - her feeling "adrift" remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation as a "midwife to grief" is clear and her persistent curiosity drives the investigation convincingly. The emotional progression from professional duty to personal investment works, though the man's spectral appearance and message delivery feel somewhat convenient. Internal conflict between professional distance and emotional involvement could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction as she forces herself deeper into the facility, with embodied panic ("breath came in shallow gasps," "walls seemed to press in"). The final choice to wade toward exit while clutching the codex shows clear values hierarchy with visible emotional cost ("tears blurred her vision"). However, the brother's backstory feels slightly convenient as motivation, and some emotional beats lean toward summary rather than full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodied habits (heartbeat counting, porcelain shard pressing) and contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to embrace rather than erase the digital ghost is earned through accumulated pressure. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("The error wasn't a contradiction—it was a bridge") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    The storyteller's motivation is clear and consistent—translating extinct languages through resonance—and her final renunciation ("I am the extinction!") carries visible cost as she sacrifices the diamond. Internal conflict between fear of oblivion and dedication to preservation acts simultaneously in the climactic scene. The "quietly articulate voice narrating chaos into order" shows specific embodiment, though some interiority relies on abstract concepts rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from observer to participant is earned through concrete pressures (the arrowhead's warmth, the confessions' weight), with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("her human memories fought back"). The final choice to return "not as a researcher" shows genuine change with visible cost—she's forfeiting her professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the locust shell serving as both tool and talisman. Her internal conflict between preservation and destruction plays out through physical trembling and bleeding fingers, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed. The final realization about "letting go of the illusion of control" lands as earned wisdom from her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in his role as a connector across borders, with the storm bottle choice revealing his rebellious streak. His internal conflict between following rules and bending them manifests through concrete action. However, the transformation from releasing the storm to its effect on soldiers and arcade lacks sufficient causal grounding, and some emotional transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("Elias smiled" after witnessing profound change).

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elio's motivation to "interpret silence as possibility" drives consistent action through the piece, with concrete embodied details like "boots scuffing the floorboards as softly as a mouse's whispers." The character makes specific micro-choices (following wind bells, singing to the courtyard) that reveal values, though the internal contradiction could be sharper. The final transformation from finding beauty in quiet to making something from it shows genuine progression, but lacks the visceral cost that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation to reawaken dormant stories is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through her handling of the scarf and physical entry into the impossible space. The transformation from restlessness to quiet confidence lands with visible change. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene—her eccentric beliefs face no genuine resistance or cost, and the epiphany about hyperbolic geometry as "key" arrives without sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing lighthouse steps, mixing light into paint), with genuine internal conflict between chasing and being chased. The final realization that "the cipher of longing had been decoded: it was not a thing to capture, but a force to embrace" shows earned transformation, though the dream's personification borders on convenient abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "unassumingly bold" contradiction enables the central action, with internal conflict between duty to the woman's wishes versus belief in truth's liberation. The final choice to unlock despite her terror shows earned agency with visible cost. However, the woman remains abstract without embodied presence, and Elias's emotional progression through the unlocking lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's obsessive curiosity drives concrete micro-choices (mapping constellations, following the Luminara's bow, prying up the mushroom cap), and his final decision to wait for the next constellation shows earned endurance with visible cost. The piece effectively embodies his physical aging against persistent curiosity, though Clara remains more device than character.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's backwards-walking habit and mirror-shard avoidance create a distinctive character with clear internal logic. The young woman's arrival provides adequate pressure, though her desperation could be more viscerally embodied. The final choice to "walk backwards" literalizes the metaphor effectively, earning the closure through established causality with visible cost (confronting avoided trauma).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in protecting her orchard's fading magic, with embodied details like "hands calloused from decades." The internal conflict between preserving wonder and accepting loss creates genuine tension. However, the emotional arc relies on abstract concepts ("color of wonder") without sufficient embodied contradiction in peak moments, and the transformation happens too smoothly without visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation as a restorer seeking escape from her past is clear, and her choice to listen rather than fix shows meaningful change with implied cost. However, the fisherman's backstory feels disconnected from Mara's arc, and Elias remains more device than character despite his presence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's methodical curiosity drives concrete micro-choices throughout—comparing film frames, aligning the sextant, pressing his ear to stone. His internal contradiction between scholarly distance and ancestral pull creates genuine tension, and the final realization that "silence is language" earns its cost through prior investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with concrete embodiment through her interaction with objects. The internal journey from seeking "the physics of letting go" to understanding it as "transmission" shows genuine character development. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("quiet, analytic ache") that borders on therapy-speak in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to encode unspoken needs is consistent and deepens through specific recipients (Lira, brother, self), with embodied emotion in the trembling flower press and warm metal. The internal conflict between silence and the urge to speak crystallizes in his final self-directed message, though the resolution lacks a decisive cost beyond the symbolic bluebell pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's warmly inquisitive nature drives concrete choices (opening the diary, putting on the goggles) with visible consequences. The widow's grief and trembling detachment create authentic tension. However, the captain remains abstract despite being central to motivation, and Mara's final "I ascend" feels unearned without showing how this discovery transforms her servant role.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila's motivation to prove "spooled wholeness" is rooted in personal loss (her mother) and professional rejection, creating genuine stakes. Her micro-choices—adjusting the telescope, cataloging emotions in clouds, tucking her mother's hair into the case—reveal consistent character under pressure. The internal contradiction between scientific rigor and emotional belief drives authentic tension, though Voss remains somewhat stock as the skeptical foil.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's face-blindness drives her unique perception of patterns and textures throughout, with embodied reactions to discovery ("breath caught," "fingers freezing"). The choice to take the safe and preserve knowledge shows clear values hierarchy with visible cost (risking capture by demolition crew). Minor deduction for some telling about the guild member's "ramblings" rather than showing skepticism through action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's curiosity drives consistent choices through discovery, though her leap feels slightly undermotivated despite the setup. The transformation from apprentice to discoverer lands with some cost ("You're mad," but grinning acceptance). Internal conflict between following orders and pursuing discovery plays out in action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—breath misting, father's workshop memories anchoring his drive. The final choice to embrace repair as harmony shows earned internal shift, though the epiphany about "finding harmony in chaos" edges toward abstract rather than remaining fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's altruistic motivation is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or complexity. The ghost conceit creates distance from embodied emotion, and her actions follow a single track without genuine struggle or cost. The settlers function more as a collective than distinct individuals with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal conflict between doubt and duty manifests through concrete embodied details like "hands calloused from decades" and her singing voice "rough, unpracticed." The final choice to embrace her flaws and continue singing despite the pane cracking shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract emotional labeling ("strange peace") and the grandfather's wisdom feeling slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in the curse's compulsion, with embodied tension in "teeth on edge" and "bones into new shapes." The internal conflict between hatred of the birds and duty to travelers creates genuine pressure. However, the traveler remains underdeveloped as mere plot function, and Kael's emotional arc doesn't deepen beyond initial reluctance to satisfied duty.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong embodied grief through concrete actions (testing foam, avoiding the studio) and the chrysalis as externalized inner state. The sisters' parallel retreats into equations vs. music effectively show contradictory impulses. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("grief had unraveled her") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find where stories begin is clear and drives her interactions, but internal contradiction remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied. The man's request creates genuine pressure that tests her beliefs about absence and creation. The final realization about stories beginning in "smallest, most fragile things" earns partial closure through her understanding, though the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nessar's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" drives consistent action through tasting walls, entering the forbidden pavilion, and subsuming the founder's guilt. The moment where he becomes the founder ("For a moment, he was the man in the rain") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though the final cooking scene feels slightly disconnected from the emotional weight of what preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but relies heavily on abstract metaphorical thinking ("bridges from silos") rather than embodied internal conflict. The piece tells us she's "empathetically decisive" but shows limited contradiction or cost in her choices. Her method of singing to mechanical objects feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Character motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss ("project he'd poured years into collapsed"), with concrete embodied details like "hands trembled" and "gritted his teeth." The transformation from failed engineer to "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is earned through specific struggle, though the final emotional state could use more embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and grounded in her archival obsession, with embodied details like trembling fingers and racing heart. The final transformation from archivist to "keeper of thresholds" represents genuine change with implied cost. However, internal conflict remains mostly cerebral rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the emotional arc resolves too cleanly without visible struggle at the crucial choice point.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to create music in silence is clear and embodied through physical toll ("strummed until her nails bled"). The transformation from individual sculptor to grove teacher shows earned change with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("symphonically minded mind") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alaric's chess-teaching heresy and exile create clear motivation that drives his covenant quest. His internal contradiction between scholarly precision and mystical pursuit plays out through concrete actions (kneeling, tracing the stone, inserting the key). The memory of Lira provides embodied backstory that directly shapes his interpretation of the covenant's "beauty in constraints." Minor deduction for the star-mage's appearance feeling slightly convenient despite setup.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael's motivation to "catalog the varieties of silence" drives consistent, specific choices through vibration-based lock-picking to reading entries. The contradiction between her pacifist nature and determination to break the lock creates genuine tension. Internal progression from curiosity to kinship feels earned through concrete discovery, though the final epiphany about "frequencies of others" edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to harmonize village energy through the corpse flower is clear and consistent, with embodied sensory details (olfactory sensitivity guiding cultivation choices). The transformation from rushing ambition to patient wisdom feels earned through the grandmother's dream intervention and subsequent behavioral change, though the village elders lack depth as pressure sources.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and grounded in her mission to understand the planet's resilience, with the arrow tip serving as both compass and key. Her final realization shifts from exploitation to protection, earning the change through discovery. Minor deduction for some explanatory interiority ("Legends said...") that could have been more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Anya's motivation rooted in her mentor's death provides clear emotional grounding, and her methodical investigation reveals character through action. The engineer's transformation and final cryptic state work thematically but lack the embodied specificity needed for higher scores—his "glazed eyes" and "pale skin" are stock descriptors that don't earn the weight of his revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's synesthetic gift drives concrete choices (singing colors into ice), and her internal experience is consistently embodied. However, Veyra's conversion feels too swift - his shift from skeptic to believer lacks intermediate resistance that would deepen the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" drives concrete actions and internal conflict, particularly in the chamber scene where he confronts past selves. The emotional progression from trembling fingers to roaring defiance to quiet acceptance shows believable psychological movement. However, the mentor's cryptic riddle ("unmake your failures") feels slightly forced, and Kael's specific failures (plague, theft) arrive as summary rather than embodied memory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's transformation from analytical detachment to emotional integration is earned through concrete embodied beats, particularly when the fragment merges his perspective with Veyra's. His habitual personality-borrowing trait actively drives the experiment and pays cost when his method fails catastrophically. Internal contradictions act simultaneously in scene when he experiences both the "cold thrill of a breakthrough" and raw emotional wildfire.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kail's jittery nervousness and trust issues manifest through embodied reactions to the pendant's vibrations and his hesitation with the mysterious woman. His final understanding that he was "the soil" for Veyra's lessons constitutes earned insight, though the epiphany arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient internal contradiction during the pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and grounded in personal stakes (proving her theory to her dismissive mentor), with embodied details like "fingers tracing the cold, veined stone." The revelation inverts her assumptions believably, though the emotional transition from bitter laughter to peace feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation to restore sound through weaving is clear and rooted in inherited purpose. The final sacrifice choice lands with genuine cost ("Her grandmother's bead slipped from her grip"). However, interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("hope that her loom's threads could stitch the world back together") and the emotional progression through the puzzle-solving lacks embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jorin's meekness paired with "quiet fire" resolve creates genuine characterization, and his deliberate nature drives his descent into the mines. The spectral Lira feels underdeveloped as mere exposition delivery. The physical endurance of the shards cutting him provides embodied cost, though the emotional complexity could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through the shard's physical pull ("throbbed like a second heartbeat") and his mother's disappearance drives authentic internal conflict. The final choice to throw away the shard shows meaningful change with visible cost ("his hands trembled"), though the emotional resolution feels slightly rushed in the denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's transformation from reticent skeptic to willing participant in the chain letter tradition is earned through concrete actions (stacking stones, placing glass) with visible emotional cost. His internal shift from dismissing "sailors' superstition" to finding "warmly observant anticipation" tracks believably through embodied details like the glass's vibration and the rare smile.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Herald's characterization succeeds through concrete, embodied details—her laughter "like wind chimes in a hurricane" and her mastery of the lantern's prophetic angles. Her choice to embrace both light and dark in shaping the dawn carries genuine cost. However, the internal conflict could be more viscerally dramatized; we see her determination but not enough contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lin's transformation from cautious observer to active illuminator of stories is well-motivated through the donor heart premise and the blue morpho wing catalyst. Her internal contradiction between wanting to understand story magnetism while fearing its power creates genuine tension. The final choice to dedicate herself to drawing out stories shows clear character evolution with visible cost (the wing's loss).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has clear motivation rooted in his role as maintainer and seeker of hidden truths, with embodied details like feeling the chill seep into bones and the wound healing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation as memory keeper is clear and her exhausted peace at the ending feels earned through accumulated labor. However, her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—we get "scattered memories" and "fragments of lifetimes" without specific embodied contradiction or cost during her key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor's compassionate recluse nature drives genuine internal conflict between hiding and revelation, with embodied emotion ("tears prickled her eyes") and specific micro-choices. The final realization that "hiding wasn't about retreat—it was about choosing when to reveal herself" represents earned character insight with visible emotional cost, though some interior phrasing edges toward therapy-speak ("reconcile her grief").

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's transformation from observer to participant is well-motivated through consistent traits (noticing erosion, seeking the sacred). The woman's appearance feels slightly convenient, but Elias's final understanding that "absolution wasn't a destination but a process" lands with earned wisdom from his gardening acts.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her meticulous nature drives concrete actions (sampling frequencies, matching pitches), but her emotional progression feels somewhat linear—frustration to determination to satisfaction—without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score. The final moment of exhaustion melting away lacks the visible cost that her dedication should exact.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's disappearance and legacy of silence. Her "curiously steadfast" trait drives concrete choices under pressure, particularly when she places the watch fob on the scale and smashes the device. The internal conflict between discovering her father's betrayal and maintaining the "hush" code creates genuine tension, though the emotional processing of this revelation feels slightly rushed in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and grounded in his skeptical curiosity about why people carry weather. His internal contradiction between disbelief and the compass's undeniable behavior creates genuine tension. The final renunciation of his skepticism carries visible cost as he confronts "terrestrially cosmic" truths he'd dismissed, though Lira's characterization remains functional rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "uncork suppressed creativity" is clearly established and embodied through concrete details like his "charcoal-fingered" hands and the contrast between commercial portraits and his true passion. The internal conflict between stability and artistic authenticity drives genuine tension. However, the resolution feels slightly unearned—the transformation from locked to unlocked creativity happens too mechanically through the shadow-door device without sufficient psychological struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through the wilting quill—a concrete, character-specific trait that drives choices. The moment where she recognizes truth in the keeper's grief and chooses hope over despair shows genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the keeper's somewhat convenient appearance and rapid trust-building.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve wonder through silence reads clearly, with her choice to become "seasonally mute" creating a consistent character logic. The internal consistency holds, though the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—her commitment feels uncontested rather than earned through struggle. The final moment of continuation ("over and over, like the ringing of a bell") suggests endurance but doesn't show a decisive cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara-7's motivation to contain/compress chaos is clear and rooted in her programming, with the static glitch creating genuine internal conflict. The final integration of fears shows earned change through the controlled burn metaphor. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat abstract rather than viscerally embodied, and the "strangely organic" feeling lacks specific sensory grounding that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by curiosity and reverence for hidden stories. The internal conflict between patience and urgency when discovering the locket works well. However, the resolution relies heavily on coincidence (her name matching the soldier's beloved) and the emotional payoff feels somewhat unearned given the limited character development under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and builds through concrete discovery moments, with the dance-mimicry sequence showing embodied engagement. The shift from "solving puzzles" to "liberating truth" provides meaningful character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "vulnerability as cipher" epiphany lacking fuller dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to recover deleted memories is clear and embodied through the pressed wildflowers, but his emotional state remains too controlled during discovery. The flood of "not his own" memories lacks the contradictory impulses or visceral cost that would elevate the characterization. His transformation to guide others feels unearned without showing internal struggle between personal loss and communal purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The summoner's motivation is clear and her terrestrially cosmic eyes provide distinctive characterization, but her internal experience remains largely abstract ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush") without embodied emotional complexity. The character achieves her goal through ritual action, yet we lack contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—she performs her task with serene competence, missing the vulnerability that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characters have clear motivations rooted in the mystery of the library's true nature, with Elias's expertise and the woman's patient manipulation creating genuine tension. The internal conflict between skepticism and belief manifests concretely as Elias must decide whether to speak the "language of old buildings." However, the woman's characterization remains somewhat thin beyond her role as mysterious guide, and the emotional stakes of their prior relationship ("weekly tea sessions") feel underdeveloped for the weight they're meant to carry.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's internal conflict between skepticism and tragic radiance drives meaningful choices, particularly in the climactic shell ritual where she transforms quarantined memories into "sparks." The emotional progression from isolation to independence feels earned through concrete action. However, some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("archived every failure") rather than fully embodied emotion, and the transformation's mechanics remain somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael's motivation to "forgive the unfinished" drives concrete choices—pricking her thumb with the cursed thorn, placing the scroll in the hidden alcove—with visible cost in the blood seal and the thorn's remembered wounds. Her internal contradiction between "treason" and "forgiveness" plays out through action rather than summary, though the piece could push deeper into embodied stress during the forgery act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation to understand why some echo while others fade drives consistent action through the ascent. The revelation about "unfinished stories" creates genuine internal shift, though the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final beats. Strong embodied details like the seashell pressed to his heart anchor emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation as a mediator between living and dead is clear and consistent, driving him to weave truth carefully through dreams rather than direct revelation. The sailor's ghost's motivation—lingering from love rather than vengeance—provides strong emotional grounding. However, the three dream-receivers lack sufficient setup to feel inevitable as choices, and Kael's internal conflict remains understated when he could show more contradiction between duty and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's philosophical stance and patient net-mending create a coherent character, and his final realization about hidden patterns feels earned through his methodical observation. However, the epiphany lacks embodied struggle—he simply "laughs, a sound soft and startled" without deeper physical or emotional cost that would elevate the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation as a "truth excavator" drives consistent choices through investigation to sacrifice. Her decision to seal the stillpoint emerges from established traits with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent - isolation paired with obsessive pursuit of ancient wisdom through radio frequencies. His transformation from rejected prophet to conductor of the new dawn feels earned through accumulated details. However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("variant allegiance between earth and void") rather than embodied contradiction, and the emotional cost of his isolation never manifests viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "sweeten the world's sharp edges" drives consistent action through the capturing and releasing of sounds. The emotional embodiment when hearing his mother's lullaby ("tears pricking his eyes") lands effectively. However, the meta-commentary about his poetry attempts ("Still too long. One more try.") breaks immersion and reads as workshop artifact rather than authentic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with embodied stress ("legs burned, vision blurring") and concrete internal conflict between logic and emotional resonance. The ghost confrontation forces meaningful choice with visible cost, though some interiority relies on abstractions like "logically emotional" without fully dramatizing the contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through physical gestures (tracing viaducts, adjusting filings) with concrete internal conflict shown in his cursed impatience giving way to learned patience. The transformation from haste to "softly purposeful" is earned through specific struggle, though the secondary characters (elders, acolyte) lack dimensional pressure beyond thematic validation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to expose Cole's manipulation is clear and drives the climactic choice, with internal conflict between using the lantern's power versus breaking free. The "watchfully calm" trait manifests consistently through her methodical investigation. However, Cole remains underdeveloped as an off-page antagonist, and Mara's emotional progression from compliance to defiance lacks intermediate beats that would deepen the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's deliberate nature and moral weighing come through in concrete actions (tracing the music box, careful word choice), and his final decision to "turn apology into action" shows earned change with visible cost. The clockwork heart as "apology in metal" effectively embodies the inmates' contradictory impulses between regret and hope. Minor deduction for Mrs. Elms remaining somewhat functional rather than applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's obsessive motivation drives clear choices throughout, from studying the arrow tip's gaps to mounting the glider for the final attempt. Her contradictory impulses ("steadily curious" yet restless) manifest in scene through concrete actions. The final choice to hurl the arrow tip into the bell is earned through prior pattern-work, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("The algorithm, she'd theorized, wasn't in the metal but in the *gaps*").

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent - hunting for truth about Elara's disappearance - and her final choice to upload coordinates and flee shows agency under pressure. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; we get determination but not the cost of her choices. The story relies on competence without genuine struggle until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to quiet the storm through empathy is clear and consistent, with embodied details like "her shadow stretching long across the snow." The internal logic of weaving together past empathy to fortify the present feels earned. However, the emotional progression through the mirrors lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she processes each glimpse too smoothly without genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila's internal state of "changed" numbness replacing grief is embodied through concrete actions—clutching the parasol tip, volunteering for grueling work to "dull the ache." The rescue sequence shows contradictory impulses (came for death, acts to save) playing out in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fold in patience") that isn't fully dramatized until later.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "gently persuasive" nature manifests through concrete action, but Lila's emotional shift from numbness to laughter lacks sufficient embodied complexity. The burned letter works as a catalyst for dialogue about mismatched destinies, yet both characters lean toward articulate philosophizing rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara demonstrates clear motivation to preserve wisdom, but her interiority remains abstract ("peripheral awareness," "walking the line") without concrete embodiment. The prophet functions more as catalyst than character. The final choice to continue walking has thematic weight but lacks visible personal cost beyond duty.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in grief/healing, with embodied details like "knelt there now" and handling objects. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene—she's too perceptively calm without genuine struggle. The final choice to "shoot" lacks earned causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's scholarly reticence and motivation to decode patterns are established clearly, but his transformation from silence to testimony feels rushed without sufficient embodied struggle. The final paragraph declares change ("The reticent scholar was no longer silent") rather than dramatizing the cost of speaking. Interior reflection dominates over concrete micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction between knowing and forgetting, with embodied details like "hands raw from handling wood" and "knees aching." The final choice to embrace the sound rather than chase visions shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Motivation stays consistent throughout, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("a curse he'd inherited").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" drives consistent action through repair work and final leap, but internal contradiction remains mostly stated rather than enacted in scene. The final choice to leap shows agency but lacks sufficient prior causality to feel fully earned—we don't see enough struggle between staying/leaving impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong embodied emotion through Mira's physical interaction with the vinyl shard and her concrete professional actions. The father-daughter dynamic creates genuine pressure that forces Mira's choices. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("reunification") and the convenience of Elias's sudden ability to sing after days of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by scholarly obsession to understand sealed awakenings. Her "quietly deliberate" approach manifests through methodical research spanning nights. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion during the climactic discovery - she remains too composed when witnessing reality-bending magic.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's skepticism and "shrewdly innocent curiosity" create genuine internal contradiction that drives her choices, particularly in the fountain scene where she risks using the tooth despite uncertainty. The earned reconciliation with Elias shows believable emotional complexity. However, Elias's motivations remain underdeveloped—his years-long absence and sudden return lack sufficient grounding to fully justify the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her mother's teaching about sharing light. Her internal conflict between understanding stillness and the act of release works well. The character progression from misunderstanding ("chasing storms") to comprehension ("the space between heartbeats") feels earned through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's internal contradiction between hiding and connecting drives authentic choices, particularly when she unclasps the pendant containing the accident's obsidian shard. The moment "I've been afraid to lose him twice" embodies genuine vulnerability. Minor deduction for Elias reading slightly functional as wisdom-dispenser rather than fully contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clara's internal conflict between neat endings and messy truths drives genuine choices, particularly in deleting her manuscript's resolution. The seashell fragment functions as both memory and key, embodying her contradictory impulses. Minor deduction for the guide-figure's dialogue edging toward thesis statement ("endings aren't walls—they're doors").

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira's motivation to heal the arbor's fading magic is clear and consistent, driving her obsession with the vine tendril and culminating in community-building. However, her internal complexity remains surface-level—she experiences wonder and determination but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation from solitary tinkerer to community leader happens too smoothly without genuine struggle or cost to her previous isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his patient methodology embodies character through action, particularly in the meticulous seal-building sequence. The transformation from searching to understanding feels earned through his deliberate ritual. However, the epiphany about "translating heartbeats into maps" arrives somewhat abstractly without sufficient embodied struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias demonstrates consistent peripheral focus as a character trait that drives his methodology, with internal consistency between his sideways problem-solving and the timer restoration. His motivation is clear and rooted, though the internal conflict between wonder preservation and skepticism ("reason's cellar wasn't just another name for a grave") could be more deeply embodied in scene choices rather than reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—his trembling hands with the obsidian, the smile at imagining himself as a flea. The decision to leave his mother's locket untouched serves as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("something held him back"). Minor deduction for slight emotional summary ("a rare thing") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's motivation is grounded in specific grief and the tangible act of carving. The internal contradiction between holding on and letting go plays out through concrete action. However, the "lion tamer's widow" identity feels more like a label than lived experience - we never see how this specific loss differs from any other widowhood.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's motivation to negotiate with her ghost through collected fragments is clear and consistent, with embodied exhaustion ("I'm tired") and visible renunciation at closure. However, the ghost's nature as "her younger self" creates some confusion about whether this is internal conflict or external haunting, and emotional transitions (particularly the unexplained smile) lack sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming broken systems through functional creativity—and her final choice to repurpose the terminal shows genuine agency. However, her internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; she moves too smoothly from discovery to solution without embodied struggle or genuine doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira's internal contradiction between order and wildness acts throughout the scene, culminating in an earned acceptance that "the keep was not a prison. It was a compass." The bear encounter forces genuine choice with visible cost—she must confront her abandoned dream and find a new synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "unravel the threads of deception woven into history" drives consistent action, and his final realization about seeing "the world as it truly was" provides earned closure. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his thoughts progress too cleanly from curiosity to revelation without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's philosophical nature and patient hands are embodied through concrete actions (examining fulgurite, coaxing rope), and his motivation to preserve ancient methods drives clear choices. The internal conflict between skepticism and belief plays out through micro-choices, though the final renunciation/acceptance could carry more visible personal cost beyond intellectual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as an obituary writer for the living is clear and distinctive, with concrete embodiment in her ink-stained fingers and physical engagement with the thread. The encounter with the spectral woman creates genuine tension between witnessing and understanding. However, the resolution relies heavily on abstract declarations about healing geography rather than earned embodied change, and some therapeutic language ("geography of healing") undermines specificity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Corvin's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and consistent, driving him to obsessive experimentation with the egg. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he experiences doubt ("It can't be...") but not genuine opposing desires. The transformation at closure feels somewhat unearned as we don't see sufficient prior struggle or cost that would justify the palace's magical restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's internal struggle between inherited guilt and redemptive purpose drives authentic choices, particularly in her interaction with Mara about letting go. The "arsonist's daughter" identity creates genuine tension that resolves through embodied action rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("guilt," "restlessness") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's paradoxical nature as "realistically imaginative" drives consistent choices throughout, with her skepticism creating genuine tension against her belief in "quiet echoes." The final moment where "the skeptic in her still doubted, but the imaginative realist knew" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously with earned cost. However, the transformation feels slightly mechanical—the collection of seven items reads more like quest completion than character evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lumin's motivation is clear and rooted in generational trauma, with concrete embodied details like trembling hands and the gear's hum. The ghost encounter provides earned revelation about fire as language versus violence. However, the internal conflict relies too heavily on exposition about the Enclave's history rather than dramatized struggle, and the epiphany about "quieter light" arrives somewhat abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlow's motivation is clear and rooted in family tradition and personal loss, with concrete embodied details ("chisel-calloused hands"). The spectral voice feels underdeveloped as a pressure source. His final choice to write and read his poem shows earned change, though the internal conflict could act more simultaneously rather than sequentially.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in generational duty, with concrete internal conflict between mechanical understanding and deeper intuition. The moment with the rake handle inscription creates genuine character-specific discovery. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed—her whispered words immediately solving the ancient problem undercuts the established struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" drives consistent action through the tapestry decoding. Her transformation from "blithe gardener" to "gardener of time itself" shows earned change, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her obsession with mapping possibility, driving her to write the future despite opposition. The internal conflict between fear and determination plays out concretely through physical trembling and persistent action. Her final choice to burn the old journals shows earned change with visible cost. However, the Elders lack specificity beyond token opposition, and some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("ignorance was a weapon") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation to resurrect stories from silence is grounded in necessity and embodied through concrete actions—transcribing fragments, adjusting dials, scribbling lyrics. Her internal experience layers nostalgia for her father with determination for her quest, though the piece lacks a decisive character-altering choice at closure, settling instead for continuation of established patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to "crystallize a fleeting emotion" drives consistent choices through ash-portrait creation and mask-wearing, with embodied details like "fingers smudged with soot" and the porcelain mask "biting into her skin." The internal conflict between preserving versus accepting transience creates genuine tension, though the emotional specificity of what she seeks remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's obsessive philosophy and Mara's pragmatic challenge create clear opposing forces. The internal contradiction between his "futility of progress" thesis and active preservation work adds depth. However, his final insight about "competing narratives, all true" arrives without sufficient dramatized struggle—it's more declaration than earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation to preserve vanishing arts through harmony is clear and consistent, with embodied moments like her fingers tracing the rosette. The piece shows internal contradiction between hope and resignation, particularly in "wondered if that language was dying." However, Elias lacks depth beyond serving Clara's arc, and the final transformation from individual to collective feels rushed without sufficient earned causality for the sanctuary's success.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's synesthetic gift creates a unique perceptual signature and her motivation is clear, but internal conflict remains mostly abstract ("She could feel its resistance"). The character's emotional progression through memory waves is vivid, yet the final choice to prune lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict that drives her final choice to "weaponize" her candor. The transformation from social pariah to catalyst for wonder shows earned change with visible cost—her vulnerability in public speaking. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("social pariah," "weaponize") that briefly abstracts rather than embodies her state.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to understand "alive" houses drives consistent action, and her methodical arrangement of objects reveals character through specific choices. However, the internal experience lacks contradictory impulses during the ritual—she proceeds with certainty rather than doubt, reducing complexity. The "creeping normality noticer" trait manifests through concrete observations but doesn't generate internal conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clearly rooted in finding answers about her grandmother, and this drives concrete choices under pressure. The internal conflict between fear and determination plays out through embodied action (trembling hands, breath hitching). However, Lumen's characterization relies heavily on description rather than demonstrating its "incisively kind" nature through varied telepathic interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's characterization as a "grim optimist" manifests through concrete actions—calculating odds at 42.7%, testing theories by hurling dice into the void, seeking perpetual motion to "hold the shape" of loss. The internal contradiction between his methodical approach and the impossibility of his quest creates genuine tension, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("the texture of that loss").

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's exhausted artistic obsession and methodical cataloging of kindnesses create genuine internal contradiction. The final choice to learn Mr. Voss's mother's language emerges naturally from her established need for proof of kindness. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("sorrow Lila recognized") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila's motivation to rescue dying arts drives concrete choices—from guiding tours to hosting a festival to teaching children. Her internal conflict between preservation duty and "rosewater dread" creates genuine tension. The shift from passive guide to active teacher lands with earned cost, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("threads into stories," "voice had frayed").

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's obsessive conviction that "time was a puzzle meant to be solved, not obeyed" drives consistent action through reverse-engineering and defiance of fate. His trembling hands fitting the stone into the yoyo's chamber and the "bleak exhilaration" at closure show embodied emotion under pressure. The character earns his final stance through concrete struggle with the hunger stone and yoyo mechanics, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("wild, unfamiliar thing").

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to confront fear is well-rooted in her photographic curse and near-death experience, with the opera cloak providing consistent embodied stakes. The shadow encounter shows contradictory impulses (terror vs. being drawn closer), though Vey's flat characterization and some diagnostic phrasing ("unbosomed her fear") prevent higher scoring. The final choice to grip the burning thread demonstrates cost, but Vey remains more plot device than pressuring agent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leeward's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - her trembling hands, raw fingers from gathering driftwood, and physical exhaustion create authentic character pressure. The contradictory impulses between creating harmony and battling chaos act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she incorporates the seabird's screech rather than resisting it. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("restless euphony") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's obsessive drive to follow her mother's path despite warnings creates clear motivation, with embodied stress (trembling hands, cold sweat) and concrete choices under pressure. The final realization that "The gate hadn't rusted shut to keep *them* out. It had rusted shut to keep *us* in" represents earned insight through discovery, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the compressed timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her historian's need to uncover truth, with embodied tension when she kneels by the rosebush and examines the illuminated letter. The final choice to write history as "cautionary parallel" rather than heroes/villains represents earned wisdom with visible cost (the loss of simpler narratives). Tomas functions effectively as immediate pressure, though his convenience and lack of internal contradiction limit depth.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" manifests through concrete actions - placing notes, exploring the hidden chamber. The "stoically sensitive" trait shows in her pragmatic surveying work masking deeper emotional currents. Internal contradiction emerges when her stoicism "flickered" amid silence, though the final choice to document her presence lacks visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation to find truth about the sunken city is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly when she discovers Elara's journal revealing collective denial sank the city. The transformation from cataloger seeking order to truth-bearer with purpose lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that occasionally dulls embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lantern maker's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (polishing gems that "weep," folding origami cranes) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—creating vessels to hold memories while understanding grief must be "folded" not buried. The final confrontation with the shadow shows earned change through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("Dreams are just grief with wings") without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (tracing glass cracks, clutching the biting geode) and her transformation from survivor to "seer/disrupter" tracks causally. The characterization loses points for diagnostic label-speak ("unfiltered awakening," "perturbation theory") and some emotional summary ("a sound like shattered glass") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to find the matrix chip and decode the "frequency of belonging" is clear and drives her actions throughout. Her surprise at the pilgrim's recognition and the observatory's alignment shows embodied reaction under pressure. However, the pilgrim remains somewhat abstract, lacking the internal contradiction and specific embodiment that would elevate characterization—their harmonics and prism work feel more symbolic than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's guilt manifests through embodied details (trembling watch, barnacles of conscience) and drives his choice to reveal truth rather than manufacture another lie. The brother's erasure creates genuine moral complexity, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("guilt twisted, sharp and familiar"). The final decision to break the "sieved hush" carries visible cost—potential loss of client trust—earned through his journey with the driftwood memories.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's internal conflict between trust and regret drives authentic choices, particularly when she drops the drawer pull—a renunciation with visible cost. The "terrified of the sea" fisherman's son and invisible-ink daughter provide specific emotional stakes. Motivation clarity suffers slightly from abstract philosophizing about synchronization and neutral territory that doesn't fully embody in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara's internal conflict between safety and authenticity drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to leave the compass behind. The "merrily melancholic" emotional complexity lands naturally without diagnostic language. Minor deduction for the grandfather's backstory feeling slightly convenient as wisdom-source, though it anchors her present struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between lost identity and emerging empathy works well. The final choice to embrace understanding over erasure feels earned through the lake's revelations. However, J.T.'s characterization remains thin beyond her function as guide, and some emotional transitions happen too smoothly without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal conflict between clinging to humanity and becoming something else operates simultaneously throughout, with embodied details like skin prickling "as if thousands of insects crawled beneath it." The metamorphosis choice is earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the weight of that purpose made her throat tighten").

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's grief-driven search manifests through concrete actions (card laying, saucer tracing, tree climbing) with embodied emotion. The contradiction between seeking "penance" for an unnamed sin and discovering her mother's continued presence drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought "cloudbound repentance" meditation that edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal contradiction between avoiding conflict and needing to engage drives authentic tension, with her gravitational lightness providing unique embodiment. The shadow work confrontation earns its emotional weight through specific memories and costs. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("shadow work," "engagement is the only way") that slightly abstracts the peak emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's character-particular interiority ("destitute philanthropist, her pockets empty but her heart full") and embodied emotion work well, with clear motivation driving her orchestration of coincidences. The man's revelation about prophecies creates genuine dramatic irony. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("she'd finally grasped the texture of transformation") and the convenience of the man's disappearance without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kieran's motivation to "spark a silent revolution" drives consistent choices through decoding the sundial and descending to the cradle. The internal conflict between vigilance (his role) and revolution (his desire) creates productive tension, though emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract during peak moments. The final choice to ignite revolution lands with conviction but lacks visceral cost beyond declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal conflict between understanding and controlling the patterns creates genuine tension, with her precognitive curse showing contradictory futures that force meaningful choices. The final realization that she must witness rather than control represents earned character growth with visible cost—the acceptance of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's internal contradiction between fury and tranquility manifests convincingly through embodied details like adjusting his clogged mask and letting the timer tick unheeded. His final choice to mail uncensored work shows earned agency with visible cost (risking Ministry retaliation). The "furiously tranquil" state feels genuine rather than performed, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Characters show clear philosophical motivations driving the duel, with Kael's mechanical arm serving as embodied backstory ("lost his arm in a debate gone wrong"). The final choice to collaborate rather than win demonstrates earned change through the duel's progression, though some philosophical statements edge toward abstraction rather than fully embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cedar's monthly personality molting creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly in his relationship with the tin as both anchor and burden. The moment where "he didn't panic" during his shift shows earned change through accumulated experience. However, Marla remains underdeveloped beyond her function as witness, and some interiority borders on explanatory ("a vault for his secrets").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (fingers on keys, smudged window) and contradictory impulses ("trance felt less like solace and more like a cage"). The final choice to "surprise fate back" emerges from accumulated pressure, though the transformation could use sharper embodiment in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation as reality checker is clear and embodied through concrete actions (pressing seed, entering dreams), with internal conflict between doubt and resolve earning the final choice. The "luminous doubt" that washes over her creates genuine tension between protecting memory versus questioning its worth. However, the secondary dream-woman lacks specificity beyond archetype, and some emotional transitions feel compressed rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characters are well-motivated with clear desires - Lira seeking closure about her father, Yorick as patient guide. The reconciliation feels earned through the lace-weaving ritual. Minor deduction for the ghost's too-convenient appearance and immediate resolution without more complex emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Her final stance crystallization—choosing humble observation over cosmic data—is earned by prior causality, with the cost of professional dismissal felt on the page. The trait of "preprocessing reality" is dramatized, not labeled, as she translates decay into a new language of study.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lirael's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with her artistic perception filtering the world. Her final choice to teach others is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality. The "steadily adaptive" trait is more told than shown in the present action, creating a minor motivational gap.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s characterization is deeply embodied and specific, her trauma and motivation rooted in concrete, sensory details ("hands still trembled at the memory of cold water"). Her micro-choices under pressure, like freezing at Elias's entrance, reveal her internal state. The final choice to redefine music rather than reclaim her voice is an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable. Elias is slightly less dimensional, serving more as a catalyst, but his quiet presence applies relevant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s characterization is rich and specific, with his weariness and stubbornness (“I’m an undertaker, not a mechanic”) grounding his arc. His final choice to stay is earned by the dream memory of his goldfish, a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic label-speak (“his inadvertently stubborn nature flaring”) which briefly abstracts his state.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality, though the diagnostic phrasing "spiritually curious" slightly dampens peak interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific obsession, and intensifies to compel the climactic choice. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied perception ("retrocognitively trapped," head spinning) rather than alternating summaries. The final renunciation of her goal for a new understanding is earned by the prior causality of the experiment's cost. A slight deduction for the final beat's clarity; the shift from wanting to touch time to wanting to remember is profound but could be slightly more legible in its micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choices. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, tragic backstory. Her synesthesia and profession are well-integrated, and her final choice to don the forged hearing aid is a credible, high-stakes renunciation that forecloses a path. The primary deduction is for a minor reliance on summarized backstory ("He’d left for the shipwrecks one night...") which, while functional, slightly abstracts a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's characterization is specific and embodied, with a clear hierarchy of values revealed under pressure. Her internal conflict—a thief who has never given—culminates in the earned, costly choice to offer her own memory.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael's contemplative nature and glassblower background are deeply integrated, informing his perception and actions. His motivation to create "safe zones" is clear and consistently drives his search. A minor slip occurs when he articulates a near-thematic statement ("Even broken things... can catch the light"), which feels slightly diagnostic for a mid-crisis realization, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila's characterization is strong with embodied emotion and credible micro-choices under pressure, such as her trembling legs showing "certainty." Her phobias and adaptive nature are consistently woven into action, not just labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara's obsession is embodied through concrete actions like tracing cracks and resisting distractions. Her final choice to accept the map's imperfection ("Let it be a living thing") feels earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic tinge in "silence was not empty but layered," though it's quickly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Unit-17's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly; its micro-choice to touch the violin is a perfect expression of its core desire. The trait of being "remarkably composed" is embodied under the overwhelming pressure of existing in multiple timelines, creating a credible and character-specific endurance. The final, earned stasis as a philosopher-janitor forecloses its simpler existence with a visible cost of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in meticulousness and curiosity, intensifying to compel his higher-stakes choice to follow Lira. His internal conflict is shown through his struggle with the forecourt’s silence and his own logs of omission.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's characterization is specific and embodied, her motivation clear and consistent. Her final choice to teach Joren is earned by her prior causality and reveals her hierarchy of values. Joren's on-page change provides a credible secondary pressure. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic label in "wisely pragmatic," but it is immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to recalibrate the nexus. Her embodied emotion ("sweat trickling down her temple") and micro-choices under stress reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The director's late appearance applies immediate pressure, though his role is minimal. A minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic "curiosity, a drive" label in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her established character as a musician obsessed with the in-between. Her internal conflict—between skepticism and belief—is dramatized through embodied emotion and micro-choices, such as tracing the symbols and vowing to finish the symphony. The final choice feels earned by the prior causality of her discovery and the ghost's implied pressure. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on summary for her "lately inspired" trait.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lirael's characterization is vivid and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (smudging the illustration, pressing her palm to the glass) revealing her internal conflict. Her motivation to find the weight of a swallowed truth is dramatized through her actions, culminating in a credible, earned renunciation of her role. The director, while minimally on the page, applies immediate professional pressure. A slight deduction for the director's characterization feeling slightly more functional than fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a coherent, motivated explorer whose skepticism and thrill-seeking drive the plot. His embodied fear and the final, earned renunciation of the valve wheel are strong. A minor deduction for his "religious skepticism" being more told than shown in early pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling their journey. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. However, the final transformation into "becoming silence" is slightly abstract, leaning on thematic resonance rather than a dramatized, embodied cost, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s mellow patience and adaptive nature are shown through her actions and dialogue, creating a credible, empathetic therapist. Mara’s blunt skepticism provides a strong counterpoint, and her shift to cautious exuberance is earned through the dramatized moment with the curl. A minor deduction for a moment of telling (“softly adaptive to Mara’s bluntness”) that could be more fully embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions like tracing walls and probing ashes. His sensitively perceptive trait drives micro-choices that escalate stakes, and his final recognition of the axis shift feels earned by prior causality with visible cost when the tapestry's dragons unfurl.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, moving from a vague restlessness to a crystallized purpose after reading her father's letters. Her micro-choices—descending to the safehouse, reading the letters, typing the new fortune—are concrete and reveal her values. The final choice to continue her father's work is earned by the discovered causality. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on told backstory in the father's letter.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under peak pressure. The final endurance is earned, but the emotional state remains relatively monolithic, missing the layered irrationality of a true crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her homesickness, compelling her to write. Her internal conflict is embodied through tactile interaction with the shell and her "chronologically homesick" heart. A micro-choice to hold the shell to her ear earns the final, resonant stasis. The only minor limitation is a slight abstraction in her goal of conducting "unheard symphonies," though it is grounded in specific memories.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her core contradiction: the desire for connection versus the safety of distance. Her final choice to embrace all versions of herself is earned by the on-page journey through the timelines, with the cost of her power's loss felt in the final descent. The interiority is concrete and avoids diagnostic labels, though the emotional weight of witnessing the timelines could be more embodied in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lila's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her deafness and profession informing her unique perception. Her emotional numbness is a concrete, felt motivation that drives her to the cavern. Her final choice to embrace the hush is earned through her on-page experimentation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's meticulous, data-driven nature is consistently embodied and motivates his shift from observer to actor.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her aromatic sensitivity driving the central conflict. Her micro-choices under pressure—hesitation, then decisive uncorking—reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in her fear versus need for answers.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's characterization is vivid and specific (ink-stained fingers, coat full of verses), and his final choice to untie the knots is a credible micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. However, the trait "ethically playful" is stated rather than fully dramatized through a visible trade-off, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear, rooted in her role and grief, and intensifies to compel a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation to fuse insight with empathy is clear and consistent, driving his professional choices. His affectionate detachment is embodied in his practiced smile and precise movements, though his internal contradiction could be more active in scene. The micro-choice to offer the blotter petal for testing reveals his values hierarchy, trusting the client's experience. A slight deduction for the "professionally thorough" trait being more stated than fully dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's characterization is strong, with her professional focus ("calculating freight rates") and latent restlessness creating a credible foundation for her pivot. Her final choice to forge the letter is a micro-decision that feels earned by her prior inaction and the locket's prompt, though the swiftness of her full commitment slightly rushes the emotional calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and rooted in his sympathetic nature, compelling his search for connection. His "luminescent ache" is a slightly diagnostic label, but it is quickly embodied as a "mix of hope and longing."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila's characterization is specific and driven by professional curiosity and personal history. Her micro-choices, like leaning over the railing and twisting the pendant, reveal her values under pressure. The final choice to uncage time feels earned by her established traits and the pendant's established reactivity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in ambiguous loss, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's curiosity and desire to magnify magic are clear drivers, compelling her higher-stakes choice to accept the pearl.

The final endurance is earned, with a visible cost in the altered cave song.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her method is distinct, but her internal contradiction and emotional embodiment are underdeveloped. Her competence is steady without the genuine struggle or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure, making her final success feel more procedural than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's meticulous and artistic nature is embodied and drives his choices, particularly in solving the arrow puzzle. His internal conflict between analysis and intuition is dramatized, and his final choice to accept the blank ticket feels earned.

Her micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the tile and choosing to transcribe, are motivated and reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, with clear, consistent motivation rooted in her con-artist upbringing ("Trust the math, kid"). Her internal conflict is embodied in her choice to act, and her final decision to trade the scroll for asylum is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals her values. A minor deduction for the ink's effect granting near-telepathic insight, which slightly simplifies the complexity of reading opponents under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Althea’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her studious, inventive nature. Her interiority is concrete and particular, shown through specific actions like tracing the notepad and charting the hum. However, the final choice—writing furiously—is a reactive intensification rather than a difficult micro-choice revealing contradictory values under new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in the core concept of erased history. His trait of filtering reality differently is a compelling interior contradiction that is shown, not told. The final choice to embrace his identity is earned by the cumulative fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)

    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, melancholic curiosity. Her final choice to activate the vial is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values, prioritizing legacy over duty. The embodied emotion ("gloves trembled," "breath fogged the visor") and the Earned Stasis of her quiet acceptance of obscurity are earned by the causal build-up. A slight deduction for a minor over-articulation of her grandfather's thematic thesis, which edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's characterization is exceptional, with her blindness integrated as a genuine constraint that shapes her perception and methods. Her micro-choices under pressure—using the water basin, trusting Marlow's guidance—reveal a clear hierarchy of values focused on precision and listening.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her professional curiosity, intensifying under pressure. Her dry wit and subtle confidence are embodied in micro-choices, like tracing condensation and her final smile.

Jorn applies secondary pressure, but his role is functional rather than deeply transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his profession, compelling his patient, rhythmic actions.

The final renunciation is earned but feels more thematic than personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her to release the memories rather than trap them. Her internal conflict is shown in scene ("override the urge to act"), and her final choice to let go is earned by the priests' revealed folly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ghost bride's motivation is clear, complex, and rooted in a specific backstory of betrayal and a layered mix of grief and gratitude. Her final choice (freeing him to free herself) is earned.

Her micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the chain’s links while the amphitheater breathes, reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in a tangible, embodied need ("her own skin, etched with fading constellations, ached for renewal"). Her final choice to write the verse is a high-stakes, earned culmination of her struggle between opposing pulls (earth/sky, fledge/anchor).

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent, her embodied emotion is strong, and her final choice is earned. The "chaste courtesan" contradiction is intriguing but remains a label; its specific, lived-in tension isn't fully dramatized on the page, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, dramatized ethical conflict. His micro-choices (rehearsing, manipulating the stick, engaging the audience) reveal his values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her esoteric realism driving every micro-choice. Her trembling hands and meticulous knotting reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; interiority remains concrete and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in specific trauma (workshop fire, loss of voice), with embodied emotion ("hands raw but steady") and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's characterization is vivid and specific, with her "precisely playful" nature shown through action ("tracing the edge of a wafer seal"). Her internal contradiction (foresight/hindsight) is dramatized and her final realization feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's "scheming pacifist" nature is a compelling contradiction, embodied in her risky, premeditated act of teaching. Her motivation to "teach resentment to release" is clear and drives every on-page choice. The final endurance—accepting that the lesson won't stick forever—is an Earned Stasis that feels scaled to her struggle. A slight deduction for the "cellular memory" method, which feels more like a plot device than a fully integrated aspect of her character.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is characterized through concrete, occupational micro-choices and a credible shift from grounded craftsman to dream-chaser.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete, embodied emotion (the hair ribbon as a tactile reminder). Her persistence feels earned, and her final choice to mend the eye is a credible act of endurance that forecloses the path of abandonment with visible cost (the orchard blooming).

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her interiority is concrete and embodied ("her hands trembling," "breath hitched").

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation to "translate chaos into order" is clear, consistent, and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to reconfigure the rope.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion ("ribs ache") and a micro-choice (pressing the stone) that reveals her values.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)

The final endurance and renunciation of needing to see the stars fully return is earned by her prior causality, with the cost of her bleeding hands and solitary labor felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and intensifies, shifting from archiving to active participation. Her preemptive nostalgia is a specific, embodied trait that drives her choices. The final stance crystallization—seeing herself as part of the memory—is earned by her on-page actions and the cost of the fading fog. A slight deduction for a minor tell in the final paragraph ("her heart full") that abstracts the earned emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and rooted in a specific failure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to ignite the lilies. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (“her breath hitched,” “laughed, a sound raw and unfamiliar”).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to heal her environment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's characterization is a strength, with her "wisely adventurous" paradox forged through backstory that informs her present micro-choices, such as pressing the ruby shard. Her final choice to place the shard against the void is a credible renunciation of a traditional "claiming," earned by her established role as a keeper of stories rather than a seeker of power. The embodied emotion under pressure is specific, though the diagnostic label "wisely adventurous" is stated rather than fully dramatized in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and a credible micro-choice to reach out.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cedric's withdrawn state and crystallizing motivation are embodied through concrete micro-choices (tracing the illustration, gripping the program). His final laugh and realization feel earned by prior causality, with the cost of his transformation legible in his glowing skin and the greenhouse's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her past and her father's legacy. Her "carefully resourceful" trait is demonstrated through on-page actions like decoding chatter and improvising the submerged tunnel route.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is a fully realized character whose motivation is clear, rooted in a haunting prophecy. His internal conflict is embodied through his music and the "negative space" technique, a credible and unique struggle. The final choice to play on, a renunciation of passivity, is earned by his established history with the grotto and feels costly, leaving the peace tinged with uncertainty. A minor deduction for the prophecy's backstory feeling slightly summarized, though it successfully anchors his present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elinor's characterization is precise and embodied, with her orderly nature ("calloused hands," "precision") grounding her motivation to decode the leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his specific tinkerer's obsession, compelling his high-stakes search. His internal conflict between seeking order and embracing uncertainty is embodied in his trembling hands and grinding teeth, culminating in an earned renunciation of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief and a search for truth. His internal conflict between logic and mysticism is embodied in his actions, particularly the decisive choice to drop the coin. The final endurance, accepting the lack of answers, is earned by the scene's causality. A slight over-reliance on thematic statement ("balance isn't about equal parts") in a key beat prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to engage the spirit. Her fear that "laughter is not enough" is a concrete, character-particular doubt that complicates her goal. The final choice to offer the tooth is a micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values. The trait "modestly fearless" is shown through action but could be more embodied under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's internal contradiction is vividly embodied; his hyper-awareness battles his desire for numbness. His final choice to "brace" and endure is earned by prior trauma and the forest's pressure. The woman's arrival tests his stance without resolving it for him. Micro-choices like catching the strap reveal his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and a credible final endurance. However, her internal contradiction under pressure is more summarized than dramatized in the peak beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)

His micro-choices under pressure, like using the mainspring barrel and climbing to investigate the ceiling, reveal his values and drive the plot.

A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on his observational trait as a primary driver without deeper internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, rooted in a desire to awaken something "older, wilder," and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to trigger the rupture. Her internal conflict—balancing the risk of unraveling the library against the need for transformation—is present but could be more dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice feels earned, but a deeper embodiment of her fear or doubt in the climax would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a past of rebellion and a present of poetic archaeology. His internal conflict between action and observation is embodied in his "poetically inclined" nature, which influences his unique plan. The final choice to plant the fungi is a credible, earned micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of his motivation "burned like a slow fuse," which trends toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's professional focus and Lira's embodied grief create a potent crucible. Her admission of her husband's lie is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values and earns the stone's transformation. Both characters exhibit contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final renunciation of dishonesty carries a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's characterization is concrete and particular; her "sensibly eccentric" nature is shown through specific actions like cataloging jars. Her motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to a deeper, more dangerous hunger for the unknowable. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her trembling hands and newfound hunger legible on the page. A hairline deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of "hungry for more," which trends toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's characterization is exceptionally concrete, with her driftwood sculptures and "perpetually learning brain" shaping her actions under pressure. Her final role reconfiguration from sculptor to timeline weaver feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in abandoned art.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her grandmother's legacy, compelling her to higher-stakes choices like trespassing in the cathedral. Her internal conflict between her commissioned work and her true obsession is shown simultaneously. The final choice to paint the shadows is earned by her prior discoveries. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on told backstory in the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her retrocognitive gift, compelling her to risk her identity for the truth. Her internal conflict is embodied through specific, high-cost choices, particularly her decision to descend into the tunnels despite foreseeing her death.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)

However, the emotional embodiment occasionally leans toward summary ("left him hollow") rather than fully dramatized contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elder Voss's characterization is deeply integrated with his role; his motivation to archive emotional patterns drives the entire narrative. His internal conflict—decoding versus passive listening—culminates in a credible, earned endurance (choosing to listen, not stop the storm) with visible cost in his resolve. His embodied emotion ("spine tighten," "trembling fingers") and professional competence are flawlessly balanced. The final choice is a perfect Earned Stasis, foreclosing intervention in favor of archiving, with the cost felt in the garden's held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in generational duty, compelling her high-stakes choice. The "furiously tranquil" mindset is an intriguing paradox, though its embodiment under peak pressure is more stated than viscerally felt, preventing a higher score. Her final, wild laugh feels earned by the prior causality of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's credibly curious nature drives her to experiment, and her final choice to play a rhythm is a micro-choice that reveals her values. Her humility and competence are balanced, though her emotional shift from grin to fading smile could be more embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zara's characterization is deeply specific and embodied. Her motivation ("to find strength in vulnerability") is dramatized through concrete action (walking to the crater, kneeling) and a micro-choice (holding up the lantern to Veyra) that reveals her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's characterization is strong, with a clear motivation that intensifies under pressure. His final choice to speak is earned by his prior, tranquil perceptiveness and the ghosts' guidance.

    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her belief in harmonizing discord. Her actions are deliberate and character-specific, particularly the micro-choice to respond to the snapped kite string by tending and weaving. The final renunciation of permanence feels earned. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward abstract articulation of her philosophy in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's characterization is deeply integrated with her actions; her "gently systematic" mantra and terminal diagnosis inform her patient, purposeful work.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elio's motivation is clear and rooted in his pariah status and intellectual curiosity. His internal conflict between confusion and exploration is embodied in his actions and the final choice feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)

The final renunciation of "thief" for "guardian" is earned by the on-page cost of the spire's violent tremors.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's characterization is rich with embodied contradiction—her scars and performance grief feel authentic. Her motivation to document small gestures drives the entire narrative, culminating in an earned realization that she is the pawn.

A slight deduction for the prince's memory feeling slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's rationality and motivation are clear and consistent, compelling her higher-stakes choice to use the ledger. Her embodied emotion ("heart sinking") and micro-choice to use the eye feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his established eccentricity and past trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("her heartbeat syncing with the drip of water").

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)

    Interiority is concrete and embodied ("a feral nostalgia that clawed at my ribs"). The final choice to climb is motivated by the scroll's discovery and a credible, character-specific internal conflict. A minor deduction for the diagnostic-sounding "chronologically confused," though it is quickly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)

    Kael's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority, embodied emotion, and a clear, escalating motivation rooted in his scars and failures.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara's "gossip-column exorcist" persona is a fresh, specific anchor; her competence and wry observation ("regret was her currency") ground her. Elias's grief and guilt are embodied in his "bruised" eyes and trembling hands, compelling his choice to play. The final directive to play "imperfectly" is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values, earning the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's internal conflict between analysis and surrender is embodied and drives the final choice. His "spatially gifted mind" is shown, not told, and his micro-choice to step through the barrier is a credible, high-stakes action rooted in his established obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara's characterization is vivid and contradictory, her compulsive urge to bet on chaos ("hummed in her veins") embodied and specific. Her final choice to "widen perspectives" is earned by her father's legacy and her own struggle, though her gambling trait is more backstory than active present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara's characterization is concrete and specific, with her philosophy of "cultivated estrangement" driving her micro-choices to connect callers.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied worldview ("small moments held the weight of empires"). Her internal conflict between "haunted euphoria" and the dread of fading beauty is concrete. A minor deduction for a single instance of slightly abstract phrasing ("the thrill that it might not") in an otherwise deeply embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation ("he believed in debts") is clear and consistent, compelling his high-stakes choice to participate. His internal conflict is shown through embodied emotion ("chest didn't ache as much") and a micro-choice to follow Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling his high-stakes choices. His blindness is not a gimmick but a core trait that filters his perception and drives his actions. The final choice to find the stillpoint is earned by his prior struggle and the tactile cost of his journey. The only minor deduction is for a slight over-reliance on the ring's translation as a plot device, which occasionally simplifies his internal processing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, compelling his high-stakes choice to collaborate. His internal conflict (“confidently uncertain”) is concrete and embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, specific worldview. His actions under pressure—mapping silence, collaborating with Lira—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling high-stakes choices. Her interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in the tactile connection to ink and canvas. The final choice to become a "gardener" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tears. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic label in "analytically intuitive," but it is immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli's motivation is clear and rooted in his "quiet rebellion," compelling his choices. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in his connection to the lagoon's "borrowed" sorrow. The final choice to drum and embrace entanglement is earned by his prior actions and the cost of his experimental past. A slight deduction for the "unwilling guinea pig" label feeling slightly summary-like at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation to prove his theory is clear and consistent, driving his choices under pressure. His embodied emotion (trembling hands, breath hitching) and micro-choices (trusting instincts over the map) reveal character. However, the final renunciation of maps for whispers is more told than earned through a visible cost on the page, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's characterization is consistent and her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction or a visible struggle that would elevate the portrayal. Her "spiralingly calm" attribute is shown effectively, yet it functions more as a stable trait than a source of complex, flawed decision-making under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, compelling her to coach and rebel against the town's fading spirit. Her ability to hear unspoken words is a unique trait that enables key actions, though its mechanics remain slightly abstract. Lila's internal shift from "I'm alone" to "I'm learning" is an earned emotional progression, shown through concrete beats and the final choice to "keep planting."

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's characterization is strong, with embodied emotion ("her muscles coiled with anticipation") and a clear, earned transformation. The final choice to detach is motivated by prior causality, though the phrase "combative tenderness" feels slightly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lirael's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "blank-faced" exterior contrasting her rich internal world. Her motivation to "cultivate lightness" through carving is clear and intensifies, compelling her ritualistic performance. The final choice of endurance is earned by prior causality, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page in a single, pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her aesthetic sensibility, compelling her high-stakes choice to reshape reality. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied perception ("fingers brushing the cold stone as if reading a language written in frost") rather than alternating summaries. The final choice to step onto the liquid glass is earned by prior causality, though a slightly stronger hint of contradictory impulse mid-scene would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's colorblindness and obsession with imperfection drive every choice, culminating in his transformative use of the reed tongue and cobalt dust. His "innocently cunning" trait manifests when he accepts Marla's trade, suspecting deeper magic. The final choice to paint the phoenix is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in his throbbing head and the revelation's weight. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently specific, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a yearning to "discover the texture of connection." Her embodied emotion is strong ("her skin prickled"), and her micro-choice to press the lens against the carving is a decisive action under pressure. The "powerfully gentle" trait is stated but could be more fully embodied in her on-page tactics; it reads slightly more as a label than a demonstrated constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s grief and atonement are embodied and specific, driving his choices with visible cost (bleeding fingers, quiet certainty). His internal contradiction—altruism rooted in personal failure—is dramatized, not summarized. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though the motivation's initial explanation ("not altruism but atonement") is slightly tell-y, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (measuring the space, guiding Mara) revealing a consistent, curious nature rooted in her backstory.

    Lirael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her final choice. Her internal conflict is embodied and contradictory, particularly in her confrontation with Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lirael’s “softly deliberate” nature is embodied in her choice to research rather than panic, a micro-choice that reveals her values. Her final action of speaking the word “Bloom” is a credible, earned crystallization of her role as a cataloger who preserves. The emotional cost is visible in her wet eyes, though the peak beat lacks a contradictory impulse acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira's internal conflict is embodied through concrete micro-choices (trembling hands, murmured dialogue) that reveal her hierarchy of values.

Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied grief. Her internal conflict is concrete, shown through the scar's physical ache and the painful choice to descend into memory.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her spatial imagination trait, which constrains her actions. Her emotional progression feels authentic, with embodied contradictions like the ache in her chest matching the hushed thunder.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied emotional state ("Trapped creativity... was the curse of those who forgot how to listen").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied desire to rediscover her mind's "wild frontier." Her choices under pressure, particularly the final renunciation of the gear-seed, feel earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira and Jorin are distinct, with clear roles and a credible mentor-student dynamic. Their micro-choices under pressure, like Jorin's fidgeting and Lira's patient guidance, reveal character.

    Veyra’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes choices. Her "regally unpretentious" presence and quiet strength are embodied in micro-choices, like muting her presence and hurling the pellet.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's characterization is strong, with her awkward confidence and stargazer nature compelling her to act. Her final choice to use the stones is earned by her prior established pattern of accurate predictions.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nana Marisol is a vividly realized character whose motivations are clear and rooted in a consistent past. Her internal conflict between tradition and evolution is dramatized through concrete micro-choices, particularly the final decision to plant the embryo.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her trembling hands and somatic choices under pressure feeling earned. Her final micro-choice to tuck away the photograph without freezing demonstrates a credible, earned endurance.

    Elias's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his artistic frustration and existential questioning feeling authentic. His micro-choice to collect threads and redesign his approach is a credible, earned shift rooted in his backstory (grandmother's loom).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her higher-stakes choices. Her serene anger is a specific, embodied emotional state that drives her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in a credible internal conflict between duty and truth, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her embodied emotion ("fingers trembled") and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's pacifism and reverence for quiet are embodied through concrete actions like embedding the scrap and using the knife to plant. Her internal conflict between past violence and present growth is dramatized, not summarized, with micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of violence with a visible cost—her calloused hands from soil, not combat. A hairline slip: the trait "senselessly perceptive" is slightly tell-y, but it is quickly anchored in on-page perception.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s cool-headedness is embodied and tested, particularly when the goddess’s profound sorrow "threatened to unravel his composure" yet he remains focused.

Her final action of reading the letters is a credible renunciation of her escape into star maps, foreclosing that path with a visible emotional cost. The revelation of Dr. Althea Voss is a potent, earned twist that deepens the personal stakes. A slight deduction for the convenience of the backstory perfectly dovetailing with the firmware's function, but the closure choice remains powerfully motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's whimsical artistry and social perceptiveness are embodied in concrete actions (e.g., tracing the tile, drawing the mandala) that drive the plot. Her final realization is earned through on-page struggle and a clear micro-choice to draw on the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion. The motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") is clear and intensifies under pressure.

    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, rooted in trauma and a desire for authentic discovery. His affectionate skepticism is embodied in his interactions with Mara and his reverence for the geode.

A minor deduction for a slightly tidy emotional progression from curiosity to resolve without stronger contradictory impulses mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)

His motivation to "distill complexity into essence" is dramatized through the yarn needle's use and his reflective state, earning his final stance of carrying a layer forward. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the interiority of "percolate through ambient awareness," which feels slightly diagnostic for the POV.

Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through actions like tracing sun patterns.

    Elias is vividly realized through concrete, embodied perception ("dynamically observant") and a clear, escalating motivation to understand the flake and Marisol's disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his past, compelling his present actions. His polished calm is tested effectively, and his final choice to use symbols feels earned.

    Mira’s characterization is concrete and embodied, with clear, escalating motivation rooted in a desire for self-discovery. Her internal conflict is dramatized effectively through the vision of her violent past, and her final acceptance feels earned by the causality of the scene.

A slight deduction for the golden-eyed figure's dialogue, which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael's characterization is a standout strength. Her reckless idealism and guilt are embodied through specific actions (crunching bones, the burned card) and micro-choices (kneeling, sewing).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("the hollow space where purpose used to live").

The final choice to accept a meandering path is earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and rooted in his underachieving nature, compelling his high-stakes choice to pour the starlight. His final renunciation of grand magic for simple beauty is earned by the spire’s revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, with embodied emotion ("the key tag burned against his thigh"). His internal conflict between truth and ghost-chasing is dramatized, and his final renunciation is earned with visible cost when he places the key tag down.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's earnestly naive and brittle devotion is a consistent, embodied trait that drives his choices, culminating in a credible, exhausted triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)

A minor deduction for the "tragically radiant" trait, which is more a stated label than a trait that visibly constrains or enables a specific on-page action with a cost.

    Lirael's motivation is clear, rooted in a complex mix of treason and grace, and intensifies under the pressure of the thorn's curse. Her final act of placing the scroll is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values with a visible cost—the penance of the thorn's memory.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his ascent. Embodied emotion is strong ("melancholy swelling in his chest"), and his final choice to sing is earned by the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara is a coherent, motivated protagonist whose traits (observant, truth-seeker) drive the plot. Her final choice to seal the stillpoint is a high-stakes decision rooted in her established survival motive, not just truth-seeking. However, the internal contradiction between her professional skepticism and the supernatural reality she faces is summarized rather than dramatized in a moment of simultaneous, conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)

His internal contradiction is shown through his sworn-off isolation versus his allegiance to the frequencies.

Her motivation to "map empathy onto action" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to use the mirrors.

A minor deduction for the "calmly intuitive" trait being more told than shown in the critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila's numbness and motivation are concrete and embodied, driving her to the marina and compelling her to act during the rescue.

His internal contradiction—a quiet observer who actively nudges—is embodied in micro-choices like offering the burned letter.

The final choice to follow her feels motivated by his established trait of nurturing understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara's characterization is strong, with embodied emotion and a credible, earned renunciation. Her "strangely honest" trait is a compelling flaw that drives her choices.

    Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, specific worldview. Her internal state is rendered through embodied, concrete perception (e.g., "fingers brushing the cool metal of the map case’s clasp").

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's reticence is embodied and consistent, driving his observational stance. His motivation to "decode the pattern of growth" is clear and intensifies, compelling his choice to share his findings.

His internal contradiction—the desire to remember what he's fated to forget—is concrete and embodied in his actions with the chalk and driftwood.

    Mara's contradictory impulses—skepticism shielding a deep curiosity—are dramatized in her choice to use the healer's tools for magical realignment.

    Lumin's motivation is clear and embodied through trembling hands and heartache for fire's warmth.

    Elias’s characterization is strong, with clear, contradictory motives ("rationally rebellious faith") and embodied emotion ("His hands bled, his back ached").

His micro-choices, like sharing the poem with Marla and writing at the end, reveal his values. Marla is functional but slightly underdeveloped, serving more as a reflective surface than a full crucible. The final choice to embrace the chaos feels earned by the discovered poem.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("fingers leaving smudges," "keys that stuck like half-forgotten memories"), and her contradictory impulses—longing for escape yet feeling caged—act simultaneously. Her final choice to play in the hidden room is motivated by her established frustration with fate and strategic creativity. The cost of her prior inaction is felt, though the "strategically creative" trait could be more visibly constrained in her on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("chest tightened") and a credible micro-choice to confront the fracture. However, the final resolve feels slightly declared rather than fully dramatized by the preceding struggle, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Yorick's characterization is specific and embodied, with his bonsai philosophy informing his actions. His "rhythmically placid" stitching and final micro-choice to hang the lace demonstrate a credible endurance. Lira's motivation is clear and dramatized through raw dialogue. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("transfixed") in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives and temperament are precise and consistent, with credible tension between institutional expectations and her compulsion to reframe the work through dust. Micro‑choices (sampling, monitoring the chrysalis, presenting at a local symposium) reveal values under pressure. The cost—professional skepticism and potential career drift—is visible. Interiority stays character‑particular without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single‑POV interiority is vivid and craft‑specific; her glassworker lens grounds feelings in tactile choices (frost, shard, crawl). Motivation is clear (purpose after survival) and actions align. The final renunciation reframes her practice with a modest, credible cost, though the insight skirts declaration. Contradictory impulses (hollowed survival vs. compelled seeing) play through, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lirael’s motives are clear and embodied—trauma-driven, methodical, and grounded in tactile choices (electrodes, calibrations, note‑leaving). The internal contradiction (fear/withdrawal vs. a compulsion to make silence speak) is present but rarely tested by hard choices on the page. Elias adds texture and mirroring rather than pressure; the relationship doesn’t quite become a crucible. The late success montage (worldwide performances) reduces on‑scene struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s vocation and stubborn grief are specific and embodied (calloused hands, embalming stains), and his micro‑choices (booking passage, committing to the repair, staying) track cleanly. The contradiction—undertaker of the dead asked to revive—pressurizes his stance against Marisol’s pleas. His shift is earned by dream imagery and work on the lens, though the interior conflict resolves a touch neatly. Marisol provides credible, immediate pressure without flattening into a device.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s goal—to replace anonymous aid with named trust—is clear and her choice to ring the bell arises credibly from it. Interiority reads mostly through action and concrete images rather than deep interior conflict; she faces skepticism but little on‑page opposition. The cost of her stance (donations cease) lands, demonstrating earned consequence. More textured contradiction within Mira would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (seek where unused love is stored; shift from documenting to healing), and interiority is embodied through breath and sensory shifts. The artist-versus-healer tension surfaces credibly (“images…secondary to what she felt”). However, pressure is gentle and the cost of the final stance (foreclosing the documentarian mode) is only lightly felt. The arc convinces but remains tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—obsessively probing time’s fabric—is clear and drives her choices (placing and pressing the fragment, pulling at memories). Interiority is specific and embodied (geometry warping, scents, the fragment biting her palm). Internal contradiction is present but light: curiosity vs. the cost of destabilization/glimpses she can’t hold. The final renunciation (accepting clarity as the visions vanish) reads earned with a felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motive—recover seeds for her people—guides micro‑choices (hesitating on the star key, timing against scavengers). Interiority is embodied in tactile details (rusted cuffs, cold floor) but rarely presents true contradictory impulses beyond brief hesitation. Competence borders on smoothness, though the chain‑snap under pressure shows earned endurance. The final renunciation (sacrificing a vial to entangle scavengers) aligns with values and shows visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motive—capturing the sound of trust breaking tied to her father’s disappearance—is clear, personal, and drives each choice. Interiority is sensory‑particular (lavender static, green hum) and embodied through action. The internal contradiction (hurt vs. exhilaration) appears most strongly at the eruption but isn’t deeply layered earlier. Still, her actions align with motive and culminate in a credible, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and character‑specific, and her hesitation at offering the photograph gives a credible internal turn. The “moment thief” ethos filters her perceptions well. However, pressure rarely dents her competence—the guard never truly tests her and the floor’s danger stays abstract—so contradiction under stress feels limited. The cost (leaving the photo) lands but could bite harder emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and embodied—calloused fingers, glassblower’s tension aesthetics—and his whimsical self‑narration reveals character under pressure. The motivation (seek “inquiry zones”) is clear and coherently tied to his craft and grief. The internal conflict (perfection/abandonment vs. acceptance) resolves credibly. The cost is subtle (relinquishing perfect answers) but present.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s interior contradiction (phobia‑ridden yet adaptive) drives concrete choices—hiding notes in the cast, provoking the enforcer with the decrypted lines, using a TRAGEDY script as a weapon. Embodied stress (“hands shook,” “breath hitched”) feels particular. A slight softness: the later confession/arrest happens off‑page, so the cost of her gambit lands less viscerally. Occasional thesis‑lines (“Vulnerability is a language”) edge toward told insight.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motives are clear and embodied—her “mild obsession” and tactile mapping of silence drive every action. Internal contradiction is light; doubt or competing impulse barely surfaces beyond fatigue and environmental pressure. Micro‑choices (pausing to listen after the gust, choosing “a final flourish”) reveal values but with limited cost. The earned stance at the end (embracing the void) feels credible if emotionally low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Unit‑17’s curiosity is clear and consistent, and its composure under temporal overload reads character‑specific. The micro‑choices (setting broom down, touching/then playing the violin, choosing to weave loops) align with its motive. Internal contradiction (programming vs curiosity; janitor vs philosopher) is present but lightly tested. The change to “philosopher‑janitor” lands, though the path feels relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s curiosity and meticulousness motivate concrete choices (fetching the lens, following the map), and his shift from registrar to “translator of silence” reads earned. Interiority is specific (ticket textures, breath in cold air), though his internal contradiction (faith in words vs trust in silence) could surface with more embodied friction at the moment of renunciation. Lira works as a pressure‑applying foil with clear status control, but she remains largely emblematic. The final refusal to write aligns with his arc but the on‑page cost is implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive—proving human touch still matters—is clear and consistent, and her competence reads authentic in the sensor‑block maneuver. However, she faces little credible internal contradiction or visible cost; she’s nearly frictionless. Joren’s conversion happens quickly and mostly through declaration, limiting relational pressure. The piece earns endurance but not a hard renunciation, keeping the change modest.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s competence and curiosity drive clear, motivated choices (pulling the lever, rapid recalibration). Interiority is present and embodied (fogged visor, sweat), but contradictory impulses under pressure are limited to brief fear vs. drive. The director and LUX add light external pressure without deepening relationship stakes. The final recommitment (“reached for the lever again”) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s motives (prove the ghost, finish the symphony) are clear and character‑particular to a timpanist attuned to “in‑between spaces.” Her actions under pressure—dipping the program, jotting symbols, choosing commitment after the surge—align with that interiority. The embodied details (sloshing boots, chill down her spine) keep feelings concrete. The vow risks social cost (skeptics) and personal risk (the pit’s danger), making the final stance earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich, embodied interiority and a credible contradiction between quantified logic and felt weather drive her choice to leave. Micro‑choices (sneaking into the office, smudging roots deeper, taking the illustration) reveal values under pressure. The cost—abandoning status and role—is legible. Minor abstraction (“she was the lie’s keeper”) slightly flattens an otherwise specific psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent drive (reckless explorer seeking buried truth) and micro-choices under pressure (fitting/turning the wheel, descending, confronting the panel, leaving the wheel). Skepticism fraying gives credible internal tension, though contradictions could cut deeper at the peak. Embodied reactions (“breath fogged,” “hands trembled”) land. The final renunciation (leaving the wheel) carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    The keeper’s motive is clean and character‑specific—seeking silence to unhook judgment—and choices track: following each fold, hesitating at the reflective pool, then entering and later relinquishing the refuge. The inner contradiction (witness vs. letting go; archivist vs. erasure of self) surfaces at the pool (“To burrow deeper was to shed another layer of self”). Emotions are embodied through tactile traversal and the reflection beat rather than labels. Slightly abstracted self‑description in a few lines keeps it just short of peak depth.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s steady, generous push toward wonder and Mara’s guarded skepticism create a credible relational crucible. Micro‑choices (Elara offering the curl; Mara choosing to close her eyes) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is present but light, with some feeling labels doing work the scene could carry. The change—Mara keeping the curl—feels earned though the cost (vulnerability) is subtle rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s motive—listening to what walls have recorded—is clear and particular, embodied in tactile choices (probing ash, transcribing thread-letters). His sensitivity and scholarly curiosity feel consistent and drive action. Internal contradiction is light but present as awe vs. skepticism (“their eyes flickering with a light that wasn’t there before”). The final stance—opting to acknowledge the voices—lands as a credible endurance choice with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—restlessness refracted through her father’s legacy—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (descending, reading, writing a new fortune) align. Interiority is specific to her vocation, not generic. However, her contradictory impulses (manipulation vs. ethics) are gestured at more than dramatized under pressure. The cost to her psyche or relationships remains mostly conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“to illuminate hidden assumptions”) and purposeful tactics (loops, indigo) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is largely conceptual rather than embodied, with little contradictory impulse beyond controlled zeal. Micro‑choices (layering questions; painting circuits; touching the void) align with motive. The cost profile is more world‑level than personal, keeping the arc slightly cool.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motivation (to weave symphonies from silence) and tactile interiority (fingers tracing the shell, breath in cold air) ground Lirael. The contradictory pull—chronological homesickness vs. present work—registers, but it rarely forces a painful trade-off. Agency is present in choosing to work before exhaustion and to “resurrect the past,” though the cost is soft. The character reads distinctive, if protected from sharper internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—“to conquer the labyrinth of self”—and the final renunciation (grounding, letting the tablet crumble) is earned. Interiority is largely embodied through sensory anchors (wet stones, tug in the gut) with credible contradictory impulses (float-above vs. choose). A touch of abstract phrasing (“labyrinth of self,” “procedural generation”) slightly distances the emotions. The cost—surrendering the safety of drift—is felt, if gently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular—escaping “emotional numbness” through tactile listening—and her choices (accepting the wire, playing records backward, returning with students) align. Interiority is embodied via vibrations and bone‑felt resonance rather than abstract labels, though the diagnostic line “Emotional numbness, the doctors called it” slightly flattens texture. The relationship with Elias adds pressure and permission, not mere support. The turn from refuge‑seeking to bearer/teacher of hush is earned if somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s meticulousness, solitude, and data‑first mindset are convincingly dramatized, and his shift from observer to witness is earned by the pigeon note → rooftop survey → clinic → vial sequence. The internal conflict (integrity in solitude vs. public accountability) is present under pressure. Minor softness: the “defender of integrity” line leans on label rather than embodied conflict at the end. Still, actions align with motives and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirael’s motive is clear and pressurized: her aromatically cautious nature collides with a need for answers, producing a credible hesitation → risk → reframe arc. Micro‑choices (waiting for UV, uncorking, inhaling, replacing the vial) track with embodied emotion (tears, tightening throat). The internal contradiction (fear of unraveling vs. curiosity) is present in scene, not just asserted. The epiphany lands slightly tidy, but it’s earned by the sensory ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s desire to read the “texture of time” is clear and rooted in his drift and abandonment pattern; the rope choice (unravel/keep/cut) externalizes his internal conflict. Contradictory impulses are present on the page—pride in his “ethical playfulness” versus the gravity of cost—and culminate in the earned act of untying. Embodied responses (hand on clay, trembling with the knife) ground the interiority. The visible cost is the cascade of memories and acceptance of consequence, not just a neat insight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive—break the wall of ritual silence and find beauty in the unfinished—is clear and embodied in her tactile engagement with the violin and bowl. Her acoustic sensitivity informs micro‑choices (placement, listening), though internal contradiction is mild (restlessness vs. resolve). Emotions are sensorially grounded (“scent of soil reborn,” damp strings). The ending choice is earned, with a felt social cost in risking and reshaping the community’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motive—fusing insight with empathy through “half truths”—is clear and consistent, and his professional detachment reads credibly on the page. Lira’s desire to forget introduces humane friction, with a small but real pause at the warning that joy will be lost too. However, Elias faces little internal contradiction under pressure; he never wavers, so the crucible remains modest. The micro‑choices are precise but low‑stakes for him, limiting depth of change.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s pragmatism and latent tenderness are well‑etched through tactile choices (taking the envelope, seeking the boardinghouse, forging the letter). The ethical compromise of forging reads as her decisive flaw and agency in tension. Interiority stays concrete (freight rates vs. ache), though the inner conflict around the forgery resolves a little too smoothly. Still, her shift from calculation to noticing feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motive—to rekindle community by finding Veyra—is clear and consistent, and his tender, craft‑informed worldview shapes choices. Interiority is present but largely single‑note; we get ache and hope more than contradictory impulses under pressure. The reveal with Lira offers a modest relational shift, but Kael isn’t forced into a hard trade‑off or exposed flaw at the peak. Emotional embodiment (sap‑stained hands, camping under the arbor) grounds him convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (an illustrator tasked to capture the canals’ “breathing”) drives concrete choices under pressure. Curiosity versus fear is embodied (heat of the pendant, syrup‑thick air) and leads to the decisive twist and entry. Internal contradiction is light but present; she dismisses the pendant as “poetic nonsense” yet uses it. The cost is modest but credible: risk, disorientation, and a charged recommitment at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—decoding her brother’s “message” and making meaning of ambiguous loss—is clear and drives her actions, with embodied emotion (sap on cheeks, trembling fingers) grounding the interiority. The twin/taxidermy memory personalizes stakes and avoids stock grief. Internal contradiction (control via “mathematics” vs surrender to chaos) is present but lightly staged rather than pressured. The epiphanic shift is earned but edges toward neatness in a couple of abstract lines.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s kindly, methodical nature drives her tactics and choices, and her shift from invisibility toward public guardianship reads earned. Interiority is grounded in tactile action (pipe chases, prying the grille), though contradictory impulses (safety vs. visibility) surface more as statements than live friction. The “sense memory” complicates her certainty, but she encounters minimal resistance, reducing pressure on her interior conflict. Still, her micro-choices track her values credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s control impulse versus curiosity is legible and embodied in the withheld hand at the hellebore. Motivation (to study plant behavior) coheres with a believable blind spot (over‑controlling). Mara provides light, credible pressure without stealing agency. A touch of tidy self‑explanation (“They’re not trying to survive…”) trims complexity at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marin’s drive (insomnia-fueled need to make meaning) motivates clear micro-choices: following the rain, accepting the exchange, grinding the brooch. Contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. yearning—surface in her wry remarks and readiness to risk. The cost is tangible (surrendering a canvas and sacrificing the brooch-as-relic to pigment). Interiority stays specific and embodied without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s curiosity versus caution is dramatized, culminating in the choice to grasp the pearl; her motive to “magnify everyday magic” coheres with that risk. Interiority is sensory and embodied (minor-key crystal, ache, throat tightening), not just labeled. The pilgrim reads more as catalytic force than character, but that suits this scope. A touch of aphoristic guidance (“true power lies…”) trims ambiguity but doesn’t break credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s motive—to mend fractured history—is clear and consistent, and her method-driven choices (placing the valve, returning in intervals) reveal character. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page internal struggle; she meets scant resistance. Secondary figures (fisherman, girl) add texture but do not apply sustained pressure on her. The ending reflects endurance rather than a difficult renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s meticulous/caged duality is clear and enacted through specific micro‑choices (reading the arrows, using the punch, descending, placing it). Interiority is embodied (“mist clung…,” pulse quickening) and his contradictory impulses (analysis vs. artistry) operate simultaneously. The final acceptance of “Begin” reads as a credible internal shift. The felt cost of that shift is more conceptual than visceral, which limits peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism versus wonder—are dramatized through micro‑choices (descending to the tile, choosing to transcribe, keeping it as a talisman). Embodied reactions (“breath fogging,” “heart racing,” “quill a blur”) anchor interiority. Motivation is consistent (seeking reflection) and evolves credibly under pressure from the tile and whalesong. The cost is modest—she softens skepticism—yet earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s boredom, fear, and hesitation crystallize into a choice with a visible cost, and his interiority stays embodied (“air tasted of ozone and old iron”). The mirror showing a hollow version of himself effectively pressures his values. Lira is thinner but functional as a foil with clear stakes. One slight softness: the “amulets feed on loneliness” leans explanatory, trimming some complexity in motive interplay.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (protect father, secure asylum) is clear and drives her choices; the “wait actively” maxim gives her a distinct operating principle. Interior access is specific (ink colors, counting seconds), though internal contradiction is light and her poise under guns stretches plausibility for a twelve-year-old. The choice to trade the scroll reads as a meaningful cost but her struggle feels frictionless at key beats. Secondary characters apply pressure but remain thin.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Althea’s motives and habits are clear and particular (the lamp, the notepad, her ritual), and her micro‑choices (leaning close, writing furiously) align with them. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are minimal; she rarely faces a dilemma beyond attentional focus. The trembling and near‑ecstatic torrent hint at pressure but not a consequential trade‑off. Character reads specific but not stress‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear drive (recovering a buried identity) and textured interiority (“colors bled into hues only he saw”) generate credible micro‑choices (shadowing men, opening the trunk, taking the locket). The contradiction—hunger for truth versus fear inside the unstable maze—registers in body and action. The final stance shift (claiming Marcus Hale) feels earned by the accumulated fragments. A convenience note: the skeleton with a perfect locket ID softens the sense that his agency, not coincidence, triggered the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s myth‑buster identity and “gloomy cheerfulness” create a tangible contradiction that drives her to risk belief. Her agency (placing the shell, bowing through doubt) earns the final renunciation of tidy explanation. The emotional cost—surrendering her impulse to debunk—registers but remains understated. A touch more resistance or self‑sabotage in the peak could sharpen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motives and contradictions (orderly mediator torn between vendors and suits) are clear and consistently enacted through decoding, planning, and public advocacy. The interiority is concrete enough (chip’s weight, reading the murals) and pairs with purposeful dialogue. However, her plan unfolds with minimal friction, softening felt cost and limiting deeper flaw exposure. The relationship with Jax adds pressure but doesn’t substantially alter her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—capture and mark “the last hush”—is clear and consistent, with concrete micro-choices (placing and timing the vial, framing the photo). Interiority is textured through sensory focus and family legacy without therapy-speak. Internal conflict is mild; she’s rarely torn, so cost feels more elegiac than pressured. Still, the Earned Stasis—accepting obsolescence while acting anyway—reads credible.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s competence, tactile “seeing,” and earned trust in the basin give her specificity, and her mentor dynamic with Marlow adds credible pressure. Motivation is clear (get HB‑7 flightworthy for launch), with embodied actions that align. Internal contradiction is faint—“she needed more” gestures toward strain, but there’s little simultaneous push‑pull beyond craft focus. The closing endurance choice (returning to work) reads earned, if emotionally restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s drive (“to find where the rivers begin—their reasons”) is consistent and expressed through concrete choices: departing despite risk, following the falcon, chipping the ice. Her dry wit and subtle confidence read in dialogue and action, not labels (“The falcon’s never late. It’s the world that’s out of sync.”). Internal contradiction is lighter—she’s momentarily frayed but largely composed—so the emotional conflict never fully bites. Still, the near-hypothermia and the professional self-repricing (“Maps are lies”) show credible, earned endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation (revival through listening and patience) is clear and consistent, and his occupational specificity feels lived-in. However, interior conflict is minimal; he rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond solitude. Micro‑choices exist (angles of the fork, waiting tactics) but aren’t framed against a credible alternative. The ending renunciation (leaving) carries a faint cost yet reads serene rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives (salvage/“harness the ephemeral”) and contradictory impulses (smash vs. patience; flee vs. endure) are dramatized through micro‑choices under pressure. Embodied perception (algae‑slick stone, fogged glass, pressure on ribs) grounds emotion. The shift to release reads earned, though the “she’d harnessed…by letting it go” line edges toward tidy. Some cost to her original drive is implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (to write a truth against a father’s legacy) with embodied doubt (“I’m not lying,” tasting like ash) gives credible pressure. Micro-choices—entering, gripping the lattice despite pain, placing it beside his father’s—reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction (drawn to “hush” though warned it will drown him) is present but the cost of that temptation remains soft. Relationship pressure (ghost father; hooded twin) is effective but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular: the ghost bride seeks repayment/freedom across lifetimes, braided with grief and gratitude. Interiority is more summarized than dramatized, but the vow to free the bead “not out of love, but to end his suffering and her own” gives credible contradiction. Elara’s interiority is thinner, though her trembling curiosity reads. The final renunciation (letting both be freed) is earned if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation and tactically expressed competence (threading, symbol choice, plate alignment) create a coherent throughline. Interiority is sensory and character‑specific, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses. The small costs (raw fingers, surrendering the plates’ images) register but don’t pinch her values against each other. Still, agency is steady and decisions feel grounded in her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motive (restore a fractured faith) is clear and rooted in her temperament: warmly curious yet cautious, skeptical yet devoted. Her micro‑choices—entering the tomb, placing the base, continuing the patient rebuild—reveal character. Internal tension (belief vs. wariness) is present but lightly pressured; she rarely faces a hard counterforce that tests her limits. The final choice to “follow” is earned, though the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear personal motive (decode the margins tied to “A. Starling”) and embodied pursuit; she makes active, competent choices under pressure. Interiority is specific (chalk spirals, kinetic clipboard) though internal contradiction is light. The emotional pivot on the grandmother hologram lands, but the cost reads more as resolve than fraught trade‑off. Minor safety in psychology and a tidy final resolve keep this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Zara’s role and motives (observe, encode rebellion, disguise wisdom) are clear and consistent; her micro‑choices with the candle and chart reveal character under pressure. Interiority is present but light—trembling hands and guarded wit—without a felt internal contradiction driving a costly choice. The relationship with Jaxon adds pressure and status contrast (he’s awed, she’s slyly in charge). The final action reads as revelation rather than a hard renunciation or loss, keeping the emotional cost modest.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, individualized motivation (to reach the moment before deciding) drives concrete choices: finding moonlight, invoking, tracing, and leaving lighter. Interiority is specific and embodied (peat, bone‑felt songs), with a credible contradiction (needs healing but won’t admit it). The change is an earned renunciation/acceptance that forecloses self‑silencing, with a felt cost (some wounds never fully close). Minor softness remains around on‑page struggle, but it’s coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s interiority is specific and embodied (mist, coral bite, condensation tracing), and her vocation meaningfully shapes her choices. The internal contradiction—grief vs. hope, translation as equivalence vs. alchemy—plays in scene. Her decision to bring the coral to the table is motivated and reveals values under pressure. Minor safety: emotions resolve a touch smoothly without a concrete counterforce testing her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive—recovering joy from elegy—is concrete and enacted through choices (displaying the fragment, mobilizing the network). Interiority is textured (“the fog clung…until even her memories felt like half‑remembered dreams”). Contradictory impulses surface (cautious elegist vs. reckless hope), but the cost of the shift reads modest. The recognition by Marla deepens Lira’s stakes credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marisol’s curiosity and “methodically playful” temperament drive the action, with tactile choices (dish angle, nickel placement, whisper) revealing character under pressure. Interiority is present and specific (grandfather’s lullaby, attention to pigments), though internal contradiction is modest. The relationship with Dr. Lysander adds a light crucible but applies limited pressure. The final stance shift (embracing curiosity) feels earned but carries a soft, mostly conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias reads as a vivid, competent rogue with clear desire (gain entry, amplify the message), but faces little friction; his competence rarely meets credible resistance. Interiority is present in sensory focus and sly lines, yet conflicting impulses aren’t dramatized. The relationship with Lillian hints at status and care but doesn’t pressure a choice beyond the simple test. The final “earned your place” lands, though without a visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) is clear and sustained, and her micro-choices (venturing outside, planting the seed, finally singing) reveal an earned shift from shield to bridge. The internal contradiction—insomniac vigilance as defense versus surrender to sleep/connection—is dramatized rather than declared. The final renunciation of insomnia reads credible with a felt identity cost. Minor: the centuries glide by smoothly, slightly softening on‑page struggle in the middle stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motives are clear and particular: a solitary, creative caretaker refusing the fatalism of the holographic director. Her interiority is embodied through tactile action (tracing the crack, humming, singing) rather than labels. The contradiction—fear of release vs. refusal to let the past be irreparable—plays in real time. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than bodily, but it’s felt in the risk of destabilizing the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s drive to repair trust is clear and grounded in her archival habit of “interconnected promises,” with concrete micro‑choices (taking the key, working through the night, making the call). Contradictory impulses—careful rigor versus reckless urgency—surface credibly in “carefully reckless” and “reckless precision.” Emotional embodiment lands via the river/silence image and the ink well beats. A slight tendency toward neat self‑articulation (“It’s the promise behind them”) trims some complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motives and competencies are crisply established, and her attachment to the chain/grandfather grounds her actions. The “slyly heartfelt” tension between precision and emotion is present but rarely forces a hard trade-off. Interiority is specific (hands, hum, measurement) but the contradictory impulses never truly collide under pressure. The resolution feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motives—shame over his grandfather, cautious professionalism, compulsive patterning—are concretely embodied in actions (dust mapping, ignoring clients, finally packing to go). Contradictory impulses (caution vs. curiosity; courier vs. “son”) operate simultaneously. The pigeons, ledgers, and tape provoke credible micro‑choices. Cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally, but it’s present.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s motive—understanding her father’s codes and the maze’s drift—drives concrete choices (kneeling to read grain, following patterns, writing her own code). Interiority is embodied and specific (“feeling the grain shift,” “intuition prickled”), with a credible mix of longing and resolve. The father’s brief appearance crystallizes the relational stake without overexplaining. A slight neatness in her realization (“The fog lifts when you stop searching”) softens the sense of contradictory impulses under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—seeking a rhythm of belonging—is clear and enacted through inviting the others, leading the ritual, and holding the feather as touchstone. Interiority stays specific to her vocation (mapping “constellations beneath the waves”) and resists stock therapy‑speak. The change is modest but earned: an inward reconfiguration toward communal belonging. Missing is sharper contradiction or on‑page cost that forces a harder trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation and interior texture (“cheerful gloom”) shape choices from shard‑reading to the pool. Her methodical actions align with her purpose, and the internal paradox registers in body and habit. The final realization earns a modest change in stance. Cost is more conceptual than felt, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s motive—to guide chaos into pattern—is clear and embodied through tactical musical choices, with a credible observational mindset. The teen provides a light relational crucible that validates her method without distorting her aim. Internal contradiction (“lightly attentive” sharpening under pressure) is plausible but the felt cost of her choice remains low. A deeper on‑page price or risk (social, financial, or loss of control) would heighten the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and particular—renew fading constellations despite the nostalgia ban—and her internal contradiction (fledge vs. anchor) governs action. Embodied beats (burning stylus, rooted feet vs. suspended leap) reveal character under pressure. Slight abstraction at times (“obsidian grace,” “study in contradictions”) keeps us a shade removed from granular, choice-by-choice interiority. Still, her final stance—choosing the in‑between—reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑particular (a glazier seeking meaning through light), with tactile actions (wading, tossing the stone, writing the note). Interiority is credible and sensorial, but there’s little contradiction or on‑page cost; her discovery faces no real resistance. The grandmother/prism thread adds specificity without deepening conflict. Final stance feels earned but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt, competence, and need for absolution are specific and embodied (scarred helmet bite, ridge ritual, hourglass handling). The choice to open the box and let the hourglass run undercuts his self-punishing stance and earns the closing shift. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, though “face only a mirror could love” and a few tidy formulations skim cliché. The cost—relinquishing a self-condemning identity—is felt but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, compelling motive (“equations for hope”) drives deliberate, tactile choices, and the methodical temperament reads specific. Internal contradiction is light: the mention of versions who quit hints at pressure but isn’t dramatized as a live pull against her present tactics. Actions align cleanly with traits (logical dreamer, lucidly watchful), though the emotional cost remains mostly implied. The closing stance—continuing trials—feels earned if a touch comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive is clear and particular—listening to “what walls dream about”—and her tactile way of moving through the world reveals character under pressure. The fear/curiosity tension surfaces at the groan and in her steadying micro‑choices. Burning the heirloom is a credible, felt cost that earns the closing stance. The only ding is a slightly tidy epiphany cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (to persuade mirrors) and tethered to grief via the sister’s heartbeat; embodied choices—humming, adapting melodies, pressing through fatigue—track with that drive. Interiority is concrete and specific (“borrowed heartbeat,” “colors bleed”), with credible strain as she sweats and her song frays under the bells. Internal contradiction is quieter; resolve comes more as endurance than a conflicted trade‑off. The cost is felt but scaled modestly to exhaustion and acceptance rather than a sharper renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (anchoring ideals in practice) is clear and consistent, with credible micro-choices (intervening with questions, staying through the lull, seizing the softened moment). Interiority is specific—calluses, scars on the clipboard—though internal contradiction is muted; she bears weight more than she wrestles. “Operatively gentle” is enacted in tactics, not only labeled. The cost registers as fatigue and acceptance of imperfect clauses, not a dramatic rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s contradiction—engineered drought vs. private devotion to an extinct bird—reads as lived and specific. Micro‑choices (placing the egg, not looking back, pouring the last river water) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. His renunciation (release rather than restoration) is credible and costs him the relic. Interiority remains embodied in action and image rather than diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—she dances to unlock and defy conformity—but internal contradiction is minimal; she is steadfast more than conflicted. Interiority is filtered through specific sensory action (snow crunch, breath mist) rather than abstract labels. The final shift to “steps lighter, spirit unburdened” reads earned but the felt cost remains light. A sharper moment of doubt or competing value would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt-driven motive (calligrapher complicit in elegizing exploitation) is specific and propulsive, and his calm, deliberate choices under scrutiny reveal character. Interiority is shown through tactile choices—the lantern, the runes, the reversal—rather than labels. The nurse and drifter apply pertinent social pressure. Slight on‑the‑nose thesis lines undercut complexity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is specific and embodied (trembling hands, aching fingers, fear of shattering the moment), and actions align cleanly with her aim to honor the overlooked. However, internal contradiction is mild; she endures more than she wrestles, limiting dynamic tension. The “esoteric realist” label lands, but the scene rarely tests that belief against an opposing impulse. The renunciation/endurance at the end reads credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s want is clear and particular—preserve forgotten names, with his mother as the emotional core—and his actions align under pressure as he reconfigures the rope despite tremor and pain. Interiority is concrete (snowmelt taste, raw hands, scars) and choices are tactile. Internal contradiction is light (regret vs resolve is stated but not truly contested on the page). The ending reflects earned endurance more than a profound re-valuation, but the cost registers.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions (order/chaos, foresight/hindsight) are clear and embodied in concrete choices—heating the seal, courting the storm, walking out at dawn. Interiority is particular (“precisely playful,” analyst-artist) and reactions to objects reveal her. The shift from decoding to “becoming its architect” reads earned but the cost is soft, mostly conceptual. A sharper on‑page sacrifice would elevate the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s frugality, grief, and skepticism coherently motivate her decisions, from bartering passage to aligning the tiles and finally accepting a covenant reframed as inward. The interiority is specific (“armor,” “counted coppers”) and her scoff at “irony” under pressure reveals character. Internal contradiction (yearning for answers vs. distrust of mystique) is present but the cost of her final stance is understated. The disembodied voice applies pressure credibly without eclipsing her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s motive (“teach resentment to release”) is clear and drives action, but her interiority stays largely thematic and declarative. We rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure; she seldom doubts or strains beyond resource limits. The last‑drop choice and acceptance that lessons won’t stick add some cost and nuance. Secondary characters apply pressure, especially Kael, but they’re sketched functionally.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s craft‑specific perception and choices (agreeing to help, designing mirrors for “the space between,” giving the etched hand‑mirror) are clear and consistent. Motivation is credible and threaded through tactile action. However, inner contradiction and felt cost are light; Elias rarely struggles on the page. The stranger’s urgency reads, but he remains thin beyond the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (protect the orchard, honor vows, bridge with Mara), and actions align, but there’s little on‑page struggle or contradictory impulse; competence goes largely untested. The remembered “endearingly feisty” line hints at texture yet doesn’t force a costly choice. Embodied moments (climbing, catching the ribbon) land, though the emotional arc stays steady. The final stance feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s obsession, tremor, and ritualized “bathroom” sanctuary render a specific, embodied psyche under pressure. Contradictions (“organizes chaos,” yet “crumbles” with her own past) inform her choice to claim the legacy. Micro‑choices (asking the orchard, stepping into the grotto, pressing the cameo) align with motive. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the transformation’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in expertise and pride challenged by the library’s demand for humility. Her micro-choices (counter‑charm, sidestepping traps, reading the “Silence” shelf by touch and tune) reveal character under pressure. The internal contradiction—pride versus the need to admit ignorance—surfaces credibly at the mosaic‑door insight. Emotional embodiment could be slightly deeper, but it’s specific enough to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear desire drives Lira and the relationship friction with Veyra puts real, if modest, pressure on choices. Interiority is specific (emerald card as talisman; bodily chimera details), and actions align with motives. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are light; success comes without much emotional or tactical compromise. The final naming is earned but not paid for with a felt loss or foreclosed path beyond leaving the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to convert confusion into order—consistently drives her choices and aligns with her archivist competence. Interiority is concrete (palming the wood, tracing symbols), though the identity crystallization (“She wasn’t just an archivist…”) leans toward told epiphany. Contradictory impulses are muted; she’s steady more than torn. The cost to her is mostly risk and strain rather than a deeper moral or relational price.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation (restore balance; find the “bloom of hush”) is clear and coherently pursued through tactile micro‑choices (reading the cracks, pressing the stone, enduring pain). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, though internal contradiction is light—she is competent and assured more than torn. Visible cost exists (physical ache, long stillness), but it’s modest. The final acceptance of coexistence with the energy beings reads as an earned stance rather than a neat victory.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive is clear and sustained—she persists to “prove that coincidences have meaning,” and her micro‑choices (sextant work, alignment tweaks, slamming the shard) align with that motive. Interiority is vivid and embodied (bleeding fingers, bone‑deep hum), though internal contradiction is limited; she rarely doubts beyond fatigue. The retrocognitive surges add texture to her psyche without lapsing into diagnostic label‑speak. The ending’s endurance (she never sees full star‑return) registers as a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirael’s archivist duty versus her urge to participate generates a credible inner tension that culminates in “The archive would wait.” Interiority is textured and embodied (the hum in her bones, the measuring of shadows). The change is earned, though the cost remains understated and mostly conceptual. A touch more friction against her institutional role would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motive—seeking redemption and proof of competence—drives clear micro‑choices (following the note, trusting the knot, kneeling to ignite the lily). Embodied emotion is strong (chanting to hold loneliness, tactile handling of the knot). Internal conflict registers as risk versus guilt but resolves a touch neatly. The final stance shift feels earned though the cost is mostly internal and understated.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to read and translate the tide’s rhythms) is precise and embodied, and her micro‑choices—handling the cicada, repositioning it, choosing indirection—align with that nature. The relational crucible with Kael is legible and affects her tactics. Internal contradiction (seer/recorder vs. partner under pressure) is present, if gently drawn. The cost—refusing the comfort of resolution in favor of a seed—reads credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motive—collecting “flavors of silence” to ease claustrophobia—drives concrete choices (clinging to the trellis, returning on command, mourning, then repricing the loss). Interiority is sensory and particular (silence as honey/old wood) rather than labeled. The final change—accepting the doll’s loss and reconfiguring it as seed—feels earned by prior pressure. The father adds light external pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—solving how to “teach silence how to comfort”—is clear and consistent, and her embodied attention (the storm glass, the hush, the oar) grounds interiority. The shift from didactic control to attentive noticing is credible, though the internal contradiction under pressure remains gentle rather than contested. The epiphany lands, but it’s tidy and largely unopposed, with limited visible cost beyond a renunciation of her prior stance. Strong specificity and micro‑choices (shift selection, route change) keep her from reading generic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motives and traits (“wisely adventurous”) are dramatized through methodical puzzle‑solving and the nonviolent confrontation with the guardian. Interiority is specific enough (journals, the shard’s pulse) and aligned to action. The fear/resolve paradox surfaces credibly, but the embodied cost under pressure is light, with limited degradation or contradiction at peak. The renunciation (not sitting) lands but could register more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s contradictions—guardian who severs ties yet calls a former lover—are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (lifting the ring, inviting him across). Embodied sensations (cold iron, burnt‑wood air) ground her interiority. Kael is thinner but applies immediate pressure and forces a choice. A few abstract phrasings (“teach suffocating to breathe”) skate toward thesis‑speak but remain earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motive set (skepticism from cult survival, curiosity, “virtuously mischievous” pragmatism) cleanly drives the turn at the bolt. Interiority is concrete and particular (texts as “warnings,” the bolt’s voice) with credible hesitation. The cost is mostly conceptual—foregoing the lure of “diamonds”—so stakes feel slightly soft at the end. Dr. Voss is thinly sketched but functions as pressure rather than partner.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks her father’s secret—and her actions align under pressure (turning the crank, following the hum, opening the desk). Interiority is specific enough (bone‑deep vibration, tears) but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or risks a wrong move. The final stance shift (from seeking truth to stewarding a new, transparent legacy) feels earned though emotionally tidy. A bit more friction or self‑deception under stress would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cedric’s motives are clear and escalate: trauma-fed muteness → desire to “capture” the greenhouse → earned pivot to living possibility. Interiority is sensorial and character-bound, with concrete micro-choices (unsnapping, descending, shattering an orb). Internal contradiction (control vs surrender) is present but could be pressed harder in-the-moment to heighten cost. The final renunciation lands, though the emotional price remains relatively light on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and specific (dust literacy, post‑emancipation ache), and his micro‑choices—pulling the folder, examining the button, deciding to open a new file—align with his motive to honor erased lives. The “door slam” reveals fragility without melodrama. Internal contradiction is modest (wariness vs. hope) but present. The final renunciation—accepting partial knowledge and proceeding anyway—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s drive is clear and consistent—competent, underestimated, and propelled by legacy (her father’s key). Interiority is specific enough (“the key wasn’t just for the door—it was a symbol”) but internal contradiction is light; she rarely falters or miscalculates. Jax adds slight relational pressure without altering her course. The final stance (“The line had held”) feels earned but carries minimal ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear motivation (hush the prophecy) and embodied stakes (cold brass, lungs burning) ground Elias. His interiority is specific and consistent, though contradictory impulses are mild—he mostly commits rather than wrestles. The grandmother memory anchors motive without derailing the present beat. The ending’s doubt (“hushed or postponed?”) earns a credible endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elinor’s motivations are clear and coherent—decode the leaves, act on the warning—and her micro‑choices (prodding the dust, building monuments) flow from her orderly nature. Interiority is textured through tactile work and ritual, though internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely struggles or doubts. The final stance shift (from skepticism to committed belief/action) is earned but low-cost. The lack of relational pressure limits deeper character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (find the compass and, deeper, a livable relationship with time) is clear and steady, and his shift from control to embrace of uncertainty reads earned. The waterfall tumble reveals embodied fear and competence without hero gloss. The final renunciation of perfection (rough repair; random clockwork garden) forecloses an old path with a felt conceptual cost. A touch more on-the-page contradiction during the retrieval beat could intensify the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation (redeem/understand Lira’s fate) is clear and pressed by his internal split between logic and mysticism. Concrete embodiment—the coin’s heat, the foundry’s smells—grounds his feelings. The exchange with Lira tests his stance and yields a credible renunciation/acceptance. A few thematic articulations edge toward on‑the‑nose (“Balance isn’t about equal parts”).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive (pursuing laughter to heal) is clear and consistent, and her modest fear creates a credible inner friction at the encounter. Her admission—“I fear that laughter is not enough”—reveals a lived contradiction that the scene tests. The final acceptance of laughter-as-feeling earns a soft internal shift. Cost is present but light; she pays in vulnerability, not consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong, embodied interiority (UV flare as interrogation echo; strap biting his palm) grounds a credible conflict between indoctrinated refusal of mercy and a fledgling will to hope. Micro-choices under pressure—refusing to flinch, catching the strap, engaging the woman—reveal values. The final stance shift (“I’m bracing”) reads earned rather than epiphanic. Minor slips into diagnostic diction (“rewire you”) skim the edge but remain world‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive and methods are clear and embodied (drinking ink; aligning breath to waves), and her choice to surrender the shard to the weaver lands as a modest cost. Internal contradiction is lighter—she moves with competence and little friction—so the struggle feels relatively smooth. Still, her perception-driven micro-choices reveal character. The weaver’s pressure is gentle but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (called for a repair, secretly chasing whispers) and his watch‑maker inheritance ground credible, particular behavior. His micro‑choices—reading dust, climbing, listening, knocking—flow from “skillfully observant.” The internal pressure (ghosts as “weightless burden”) culminates in a choice to engage beyond repair, though contradiction and cost remain relatively gentle. Embodied beats (forehead on metal, shaking legs) keep him specific, if not deeply torn.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to rupture order for awakening) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (engraving the spiral, aligning the press, proceeding despite risk) track. The internal tension—knowing the whisper could unravel everything yet choosing rupture—is present but not deeply textured in contradiction beyond risk vs. purpose. Interiority is evocative but leans conceptual rather than embodied under peak pressure. The closing renunciation (stepping into the storm, press silent) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s drive is clear and consistent—ex‑revolutionary turned archaeologist whose “poetic logic” dictates risky choices (covering mirrors, planting fungi). Interiority is specific (burnished sorrow, slow‑fuse motive) and aligns with tactile action around the shard. Internal contradiction exists but is muted; he rarely wavers or pays an intimate relational cost on the page. Secondary pressures (the Council) mostly act offstage, limiting crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s competence and ethos are clear, and Lira’s confession provides a credible internal turn with felt cost. The relationship dynamic is focused and functional: his craft presses her toward truth. Some lines over-explain interior stakes (“the ailment was not mechanical but moral”), softening ambiguity. Still, actions and specific tools reflect character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s curiosity, ritualized by jar‑collecting, motivates clear choices (entering the fissure, wading to the ledge, taking samples, leaving). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“memory of land,” “hinged awakenings”). Internal conflict (awe/fear vs drive) is present but could tighten under peak pressure. The ending shows a credible endurance/renunciation with a modest felt cost (trembling, hunger for more).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motives and actions align and escalate cleanly (finding the slide, pressing it to the keystone, stepping through, asking “Teach me”). Interiority is vivid and embodied through tactile details (calloused hands, clutching sculptures), though internal contradiction is light. The “guardian” reimagination lands, but the cost is mostly conceptual. Relationship pressure with the grandmother is evocative but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s obsession and craft drive tangible choices (sneaking to the window, painting the negative space), and her interiority feels particular. The “quietly driven” trait manifests credibly across beats. Internal contradiction is mild—she rarely wavers—so stakes lean contemplative rather than conflictual. The endurance cost is implied (time, secrecy) more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s duty-vs-self-preservation conflict is clear and embodied (tears at dawn; “I’ll die”), and her choices drive turns (parley, descent, sacrifice of the codex). Secondary characters read archetypal (grizzled captain; suave villain), offering pressure but little nuance. Interiority stays character-specific, though occasionally declarative. The final renunciation (buying time by destroying the codex) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and embodied—his hollowed aftermath and fierce refusal of “false comfort” credibly channel into his labor. Micro-choices (scavenging artifacts, arranging the apothecary, persisting with the bottle) align tightly with his aims. Internal contradiction is lighter—his endurance overwhelms ambivalence—so the crucible feels more devotional than conflicted. Still, the ending’s acceptance of becoming a conduit reads as an earned renunciation with a soft but present cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elder Voss’s motive (archiving emotional patterns; decoding the wax shaving’s “prophecy”) is concrete and drives every action. Interiority is embodied through tactile, sensory choices (grooves under his fingers, vibration in his bones) with a credible tension between unease and curiosity. The turn to “listen rather than stop” is an earned stance shift, though the on‑page cost is quiet. Secondary relationship pressure is absent by design, which slightly limits crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular (“discover the texture of borrowed time”), and her “furiously tranquil” stance reads in action. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays an embodied cost. Micro‑choices (placing the cap, scattering seeds, entering the vortex) align with her goal but show limited ambivalence. The creature adds brief relational pressure without deepening her internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—ensuring the bell’s tone and favoring listening over noise—is clear, and her micro-choices (switching ropes, crafting a rhythm) align with that drive. Interiority is grounded in sensory attention rather than labels, but internal contradiction is light; she adapts swiftly with minimal visible doubt. The mentor adds a light relational crucible without overshadowing agency. The earned shift at the end (accepting responsibility as “maestro”) reads credible though the personal cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zara’s motive—seeking strength in vulnerability via attentive caretaking—drives concrete choices (following the star, missing the report). Interiority is specific and embodied (the lantern glass, obsidian, crater heat). Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers, so pressure doesn’t expose deeper fissures. The Veyra exchange adds a crisp relational contour without overshadowing her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (to preserve unspoken words) is clear and consistent, and his decisive change—speaking after decades—feels earned. Interiority is present but tends to summary over embodied contradiction; we don’t quite see a simultaneous pull to keep silence versus break it on the page. Still, his attentiveness, ritual mornings, and tremor at the box’s glow show character through choice. The cost registers as emotional rather than logistical, credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief-inflected drive is clear and particular (the cufflinks, the urn fragment), and his leaving the talisman behind registers as a credible, felt cost. The interiority is concrete and character-specific, with banker habits shading a metaphysical quest. Internal contradiction (ledger logic vs. lyric intuition) is present but could be sharpened under pressure. The epiphany is earned through actions with objects rather than abstract musing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—tending chaos into fragile order—drives tangible micro-choices (gathering debris, arranging, humming). Her interiority is specific and embodied (texture of the feather, cool water), though internal contradiction is soft: unraveling thoughts vs. disciplined tending. Stakes remain largely aesthetic/philosophical, limiting pressure on her psyche. The fisherman’s nod provides a relational echo but not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (careful wiring, patient address to the spirit) align with “gently systematic.” Internal contradiction is present but muted—acceptance versus the ticking clock could bite harder on the page. The spirit exchange reveals values under pressure without melodrama. The final Earned Stasis (choosing to finish here) lands credibly with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirael’s skepticism, curiosity, and buried longing are concrete and embodied; her key choice—placing the amber—tracks cleanly from motive and flaw. The ache and “skepticism unravel[ing]” land as a credible cost. Kael functions as a principled foil with distinct stance, adding pressure without stealing agency. Internal contradiction (debunker vs. yearning) is present if slightly under-exploited in the decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—he aims to reclaim a battlefield with a garden—and actions (seed choice, fertilizer, watering tactics) align. The soldier-turned-coachman contradiction adds texture but doesn’t generate real on‑page friction. Interiority is sensorial and character‑particular, filtered through learned listening. Cost registers as endurance and patience rather than a sharp trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hush’s motivation to convert “distance into closeness” is clear and consistent, and her tactile, sensory-driven micro-choices (nuzzling grooves, barking for the leaf) align with her history. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little genuine resistance as riddles fall neatly into place. The relationship with Jeb adds warmth but not pressure. The change at the end feels earned but relatively costless.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elio’s motives (exiled ethicist seeking a true “north”) are clear and his micro-choices—keeping the ritual, engaging the glimpse, accepting a warmer, riskier compass—track his evolving stance. Interiority is particular (meteorite ink, frosted glass, fragments of colleagues) and avoids therapy-speak. The grandmother’s dictum risks aphorism, but it’s earned by the apparition and charged object. The cost—relinquishing overanalysis for embodied trust—is modest yet legible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive and ethos are clear and consistent, and the “apprentice of wonder” frame ties his tactics to character. Interiority is present but low-conflict; he rarely wavers or misjudges under pressure, limiting complexity. Micro‑choices around which piece to swap lend specificity but don’t reveal contradictory impulses. The closing self‑reframe (“guardian of wonder”) feels earned but comes without a visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation (to unbind the board and archive small, catalytic gestures) is consistent and drives her ritual persistence. The internal friction—art vs. truth, the gallery’s urging to stop vs. her refusal—registers but seldom bites with tangible cost. Her embodied history (scars, bridge collapse) textures choices without turning into therapy-speak. The final repricing (she is pawn/king/board) feels earned by her actions in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s need to remember and fear of the stone create credible, embodied tension, with decisive micro‑choices: retrieving the feather, seeding the stone, embracing the shards. Her interiority is specific (mercury skin, borrowed dreams) and her final acceptance carries a visible cost. The one neat formulation—“Home isn’t a place…”—risks tidiness but is earned by the ordeal. Orin functions as light pressure rather than a full crucible, which fits scope.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alaric’s guilt, competence, and ritualized habits (ring‑twisting, pedagogy metaphors) read specific and embodied, and his choices drive the action. The internal shift from culpability to acceptance lands, though the self‑forgiveness resolves a touch neatly given the scale of his failure. Interiority connects tightly to objects (threads, labyrinth), revealing character under pressure. A bit more friction or contradiction at the pedestal beat would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motive—disrupt the elders’ ritual to “refract” truth—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (smuggling ink, climbing, writing “Forgive,” reciting) align under pressure. Interiority is particular (studio, echoes, the calculated risk of forgiveness), though inner contradiction is light. The “innocently mischievous” stance carries into dialogue and tactic with the elder. Cost is present but modest (social heresy tomorrow rather than an on‑page loss).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—fear, doubt, compulsion to “narrate,” and the final decision to remove the respirator—are concrete and embodied. The charm’s pressure elicits real micro-choices (pressing harder; continuing despite burning lungs). Interiority stays character‑particular through tactile detail and work‑specific perception. A touch of declarative wisdom (“It’s about surviving”) edges toward tidy but doesn’t undercut the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—answering the cracked mirror with a risky return to the caves—reads clean and consistent, and his micro-choices (wrong turn, left fork, placing/retrieving the shell, choosing to draw) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. Interiority is embodied through tactile detail (salt, brine, limestone) rather than label-speak. The internal contradiction (fear/danger vs. compulsion/solace) is present but remains gentle; the danger never forces a sharper price. Still, the final stance—a quiet recommitment to living with fracture—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to prove whispers travel farther than shouts) is clear, particular, and embodied through concrete choices (stealing the cork, humming, scent‑craft). Internal contradiction (fear vs. urge; apology vs. assertion) is dramatized rather than labeled. Thalos briefly applies pressure and reframes her belief without deflating her agency. The cost is modest (risk/reprimand), keeping the change credible but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—mapping the “geography of loss”—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices (answering the calls, building the antenna, using hair as tradition). Interiority is specific (the tactile attention to the censer foot) but shows little contradictory impulse or cost beyond exhaustion and grief. Competence dominates without a hard trade-off or moral pinch. The grandmother’s voice offers pressure but not a crucible that forces a difficult renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motives are clear and consistent—protect psychological safety, test rumored cures, deploy the eye strategically—and her choices (taking Jorn to the hut, inserting the eye, choosing “to occlude”) drive the scene. Interiority is present but largely rational and controlled, with limited contradiction under pressure. The relationship with Jorn adds pressure and history without melodrama. A more visible personal cost or compromise at the end would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent—an eccentric keeper drawn to decode a guilty gesture—and his micro-choices (approach, question, open, vow) align under pressure. Interiority is textured but light on true contradiction; he rarely falters or resists beyond a brief hitch. The woman exerts relevant pressure and carries lived cost, sharpening his stance. The final renunciation/acceptance of burden reads earned, if emotionally cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motives are clear and character‑specific (loneliness, professional obsession, skepticism vs. yearning), and her micro‑choices (buying the atlas, following ants, touching the chip, stepping through) align. Interiority is textured with concrete memories (father’s shop, mother’s laughter). The internal conflict is present but low‑cost; she faces no credible risk beyond emotional exposure. The final shift reads earned but gentle, with limited visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear from the first paragraph and holds: she climbs to end the dreams and “unravel the mystery.” Interiority is embodied (iron taste, slick stone, ache of loneliness) and her bristling against the figure shows live contradiction. The final renunciation (turning to descend) feels earned by the encounter, though the insight lands a bit declaratively. The cost is mainly internal and could be sharpened with a more concrete forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive (restore the fading nexus) is clear and embodied through tactile choices under risk, with Jorin adding crucible pressure. Her shift from forcing control to listening is motivated by history (failed engines) and the ledger prompt, not a tidy epiphany. Internal contradiction—fear of another explosion vs. resolve—registers credibly. The cost is mostly emotional/intellectual rather than materially paid, which softens impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives are clear and embodied: the grave and the scroll provoke a choice that costs him physically and psychically. Contradictory impulses—jealousy of former selves vs. compulsion to test the ritual—operate simultaneously. The limp and distrust of gravity sharpen his choices on the climb. The final repricing (“nostalgia as compass”) feels earned by prior beats, though a touch on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is tactile and character‑specific (anosmia shaping how she “reads” objects), and her micro‑choices—cleaning, noticing the engraving, deciding to write the note—align with her motives. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. yearning to connect) are present but understated. The inference to Eleanor is a touch neat, yet it tracks with her practiced interpretive lens. Felt cost is modest but credible: she risks presumption to offer meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motives (redeeming failures, transforming scars) are concrete and embodied through specific micro‑choices: whispering “Shed,” using the childhood rhyme, committing to the carving despite risk. Contradictory impulses—fear of shattering vs. desire to transform—coexist on the page. The epiphany lands a touch tidily, but it’s earned by the scene’s pressure and the scars’ reconfiguration. Slight lack of visible personal cost beyond risk and endurance keeps this from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s persona and instincts are vivid and drive the scene, and Elias’s motive (guilt over Lila) is clear and present under pressure. Interiority is selective but effective (“regret was her currency”), and micro‑choices (unscrewing the stopper; telling him to finish imperfectly) align with traits. The main softness is limited inner contradiction—Clara remains supremely competent with little cost to her stance. Elias’s emotional arc lands, but he is more reactive than agentic until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is clear and sustained, but interiority leans abstract, summarizing conflict (“doubt and certainty, fear and courage”) rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The most vivid micro‑choice—pressing the dictionary to the mural—reveals character, yet the cost of that choice isn’t embodied. Emotional texture skews serene, limiting friction. The final stance shift reads earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lorn’s interiority is specific and embodied (the key biting his palm, breath fogging), and his ritualized agency (counting, leaning, gripping) tracks cleanly to his aim. The contradictory pull between dutiful technician and metaphysical seeker feels lived-in. The final repricing (“some truths…best felt”) is earned, though the cost is largely conceptual, not behavioral. A touch more friction or risk to his job or body would push the arc higher.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s conflict between control and surrender is clear and embodied in his tools and tactics, with Lira pressing on that fault line. However, his transition to “flow” comes relatively smoothly, with limited visible struggle or cost on the page. Micro‑choices (tuning frequencies, stepping through the barrier) show motive‑driven action, but the resolution risks competence‑fantasy ease. The relationship adds pressure but doesn’t force a hard compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—compulsive gambler vs. professor’s daughter seeking order—are embodied in tactile choices (lantern handling, tracing the chalk, choosing left). Her grief and risk appetite generate credible action under pressure. The ending’s decision to visit her father reframes the compulsion with cost, though the father’s status (absence vs. visit) is slightly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s vocation and credo (“cultivated estrangement”) yield concrete micro‑choices—spinning the disc, routing misdials—and a credible, quiet endurance at the end. Interiority feels specific (her booth as refuge, the disc as talisman) and never lapses into therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction (keeping distance to enable connection) is present but lightly tested, so the personal cost remains understated. Secondary characters serve callers’ arcs more than press her with counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserving the covenant through attentive acts—is clear and consistent, with embodied habits (ink-stained hands, nightly visits) revealing character. The tension between dread that beauty fades and the hope it might not provides a credible internal conflict. Micro-choices (inking the locket, pressing it to the post, pocketing it) align with her ethos. The cost is soft—more renunciation toward vigilance than a hard sacrifice—which limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives (debt, rumor‑driven desperation, “cure for loneliness”) are specific and embodied; his jocularity under stress and the moment he swallows a joke reveal interior contradiction. Agency is shared—Lira often leads—and his background (logistician) doesn’t materially constrain choices on the page. Still, his decision to bring and offer the rock, then speak to the ghost, aligns actions with motive. The end registers a modest earned shift (ache eased; jocularity as bridge), though the price feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive (mapping grief to hope; finding his mother’s stillpoint) is clear and embodied through tactile perception and the ring’s haptic “translations.” His actions align with motive at each turn (turning left, digging, enduring after the pause ends). Internal contradiction is light—he’s resolute more than conflicted—so the arc leans on endurance rather than a charged renunciation. Still, the felt price of stamina and time gives the ending credibility at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt and control impulse are clear and specific, and his shift from fixer to guide emerges credibly under Lira’s pressure. Interiority shows texture (teeth ache, pocketing the pen) and a live contradiction (competence vs. harm done). The relationship dynamic is functional though Lira veers mentor-expository, softening resistance and complexity. The final choice to confess and defer agency reads earned, with a modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—translating silence into music—is clear and consistent, and his actions align with that goal. Interiority is present but restrained; we get a belief system more than a live contradiction under pressure. The sadness at dawn adds a welcome cost, though his internal conflict never truly complicates choices. Lira functions well as a catalyst, but their relationship pressure remains gentle rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—honoring a grandmother’s promise by “translating” with fire and ink—is clear and steadily enacted. Interiority is sensorial and particular (obsidian ink, the unblinking eye), though conflicting impulses are muted; she rarely doubts or pays a tangible price beyond emotion. The final stance shift (arsonist to gardener) lands but feels low-risk on the page. Overall, a strong, coherent portrait with limited contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive (to understand/relieve the borrowed sorrow) and a defining trait (quiet rebellion via drumming) are dramatized in concrete choices—climbing, touching the lagoon, and playing. Interiority is specific and embodied (scars as “map,” heartbeat syncing with the lagoon). The turn to hope feels earned by action, though the “gift” insight edges toward tidy. A stronger on‑page cost to his choice would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motives (prove silence over noise; navigate under storm pressure) are clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (listening, counting steps, refusing to shout) reveal character. Interiority is specific enough (coin as talisman, map as “prayer”), though internal contradiction is mild and rarely forces a costly trade‑off. His competence outpaces visible struggle, softening the felt cost at the end. Limited dialogue keeps relationships sketchy; Voss applies minimal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motive and temperament are crystal clear and consistent, and her choices (angling shutters, refusing to answer) align with a coherent inner stance. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she meets little counter‑pressure that forces a conflicted choice. Lines like “Her attribute was spiralingly calm” read as label‑insert rather than dramatized interiority. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s grief‑tinged mentorship and Lila’s guarded hunger to “know how to win” feel specific and earned, with choices (bringing Lila into the grotto, revealing the father link) arising from character. Interiority is concise but concrete; the unspoken‑words device gives subtext texture rather than exposition. The relationship turns on small, credible moves (seven losses, return invitation) that shift Lila from “I’m alone” to “I’m learning.” The cost is quiet—Clara risks vulnerability by invoking Lila’s father—but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s desire to leave and her inherited skepticism vs sudden surrender to myth create credible tension, and her choices drive the action. Embodied detail (boots sinking, scrimshaw’s temperature) grounds emotion. The decisive shift comes a touch easily—she rarely wavers once the call arrives—so the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally. Still, the renunciation of home and heirloom reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirael’s motive is clear—quiet creation as resistance—and her micro‑choices (choosing the spoon, narrating each step, placing it beside the bouquet) align with that drive. The internal contradiction (rebellion vs. compliance) is present but contained, yielding a credible Earned Stasis rather than a decisive turn. Embodied detail (petals disintegrating, oiling the wood) grounds her affectless posture. A touch of declarative thematics slightly smooths the edges of her conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (post‑ban drive to dissolve boundaries) and aligned with concrete micro‑choices (touching quartz, paraphrasing, stepping onto water). Interiority is sensorially embodied and character-specific. However, there’s little internal contradiction or friction; she meets minimal resistance, which limits felt cost. The final stance shift feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s drive (to find beauty despite colorblindness) is clear and active, with credible hesitation about pigments and curiosity pushing him forward. His micro-choices—accepting the trade, arranging plants, choosing to use the dust—align with his traits and escalate. The relationship with Marla has legible status play that sharpens his choices. A minor ding for a few theme-forward declarations that flatten interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation (to “discover the texture of connection”) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (fitting the lens, leaving the lab despite a destabilized world, pressing the lens to the carving) align with a “powerfully gentle” temperament. Interiority is specific—imagining sound’s texture—though internal contradiction is light beyond a brief hesitation at the cave. The final renunciation (letting machines fall silent) is earned but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than personally dear. Dr. Voss functions as an affirming echo rather than applying pressure that complicates her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—atonement for his wife’s death—drives concrete choices (activating lanterns, folding origami, bleeding fingers). Interiority is particular and embodied, with occupational specificity lending credibility. The contradiction between altruism and atonement is stated and felt, though not fully stress‑tested in a hard dilemma. Change at the end reads as earned quiet reconfiguration rather than a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s method (cards + measuring tape) reveals a specific worldview and consistent motive; inviting Mara in and teaching her are clear micro‑choices. However, internal contradiction is light—she doesn’t visibly struggle or pay a personal price on the page beyond time and devotion. Mara is sketched effectively (fractal tattoo, jaw clench), but she mainly catalyzes instruction rather than exerting counterpressure. The resolution feels earned but emotionally “tidy,” with limited friction between wants and costs.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (pursue dangerous truth via “avoiding patterns”) with embodied beats (tremor, breath hitch). Kael provides a live crucible that sharpens stance; her final choice costs the relationship. Interiority occasionally leans into declarative thesis (“Corruption is just another pattern”), but the change—embracing the archive as seed—is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirael’s softly deliberate temperament is dramatized (choosing study over alarm, aligning images, speaking the key), and her interior stakes (hope’s “shape”) register. However, her internal contradiction remains mild; the risk of “shattering hope” is felt but not borne as a concrete loss. Thalos provides counter‑pressure but largely as exposition rather than as a crucible that forces a harder trade‑off. The final act reads earned yet a touch too tidy to reveal deeper flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s interiority is specific and embodied—hands trembling over spiral scales, adhesive drying—while her contradiction (clinging to gentleness vs. fear of exploitation) animates each micro‑choice. The decision to work through the night to “reconstruct” both tail and self reads earned by prior hurt. No safety‑hedging: her vulnerability sits on the page and informs action. A minor softness: some realizations verge on articulation rather than friction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive (closure via the hourglass) is clear and her embodied reactions (trembling, scar pain, teeth‑vibrating hum) feel specific. The contradictory pull—seeking answers while reopening trauma—plays on the page through her choice to keep touching the rings. The epiphany lands a touch tidily, softening the sense of lasting cost. Still, actions align with urges and the final reorientation reads earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motives (to locate “unused love” via the Alhambra and the film) are clear and consistently pursued through tactile choices (unwinding the strip, re‑focusing the reading, pocketing the artifact). Interiority is concrete and embodied (dust, rain, lilac), though her internal conflict is modest—she rarely faces contradictory impulses beyond tremble and awe. The brief vow at the end signals a change in commitment, but the visible cost is lightly sketched. Overall, she reads particular, if not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s drive to unlock his stifled creativity is clear and embodied through tactile choices (aligning the sextant, opening the chamber, taking the jar). Interiority is vivid and character‑specific, though true contradictory impulses under pressure are limited. The moment he tips “The Dreamer’s Unspoken Truth” shows motivation converging with action credibly. The final stance shift (from seeking to listening) reads earned, if relatively low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation (to fix the clock and cultivate sparks) is clear and earned by his dreamless status, with concrete micro-choices (picking up the clock, agreeing to follow, turning the hands). Interiority is present but light; we don’t feel robust contradictory impulses or real struggle before the decisive act. The guide-figure applies minimal counterpressure, keeping dynamics simple. The change to “he dreams” lands, though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and the final renunciation (letting the gear go) carries a credible emotional cost tied to her father. Interiority is textured (“sixth sense” as prickling threads; boots on rust‑caked roots), though her internal conflict at the decisive moment is a touch too smooth. The choice reads earned by prior beats (carrying the gear, recognizing the forest‑brain, hearing “Unravel”). A bit more friction or hesitation at the seed’s release would deepen character paradox under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s grounded certainty and Jorin’s tentative curiosity form a lucid mentor–apprentice dynamic, with micro‑choices (stamping tickets, choosing to leave the punch) revealing values. Jorin’s anxiety shifts into acceptance, but the internal contradiction never bites hard enough to feel costly. Emotions are embodied (“air tasted of honey and regret”), though several insights are voiced as tidy aphorisms. The final endurance choice (vigil) is credible but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elric’s motives (safety via silence) and flaw (avoidance) are clearly dramatized, with micro‑choices from neglecting the bolt to tracing the stain to breaking his vow. The internal contradiction—custodian of quiet vs. necessary speech—plays on the page at the confrontation with Lady Veyra. Embodied feeling is present but often translated into lyric abstraction rather than tactile stress. The change (speaking and redefining his role) feels earned, though the personal cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s motive is vivid and consistent, and her competence reads cleanly under pressure. However, there’s little internal contradiction or felt hesitation; she never wavers, which flattens complexity. The “regally unpretentious” presence shows in action when she commands the courtiers, but it carries no visible cost. The final declaration lands, yet the emotional price for reclaiming legacy is barely explored on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—refusing “ghost data” and needing to know why paths disappear—is clear and sustained through concrete habits (the tapping) and targeted choices (cross‑referencing, braving the storm). Interiority is specific to her lexicon as a biologist grieving bleaching reefs. However, she rarely exhibits simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves from certainty to action without much inner friction. Kael functions mostly as a foil and folds quickly, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motives and traits are clear and embodied—bare feet, opera glasses, and stubborn belief drive concrete choices under skepticism. The relationship with Jax offers immediate pressure and a small but meaningful status shift. Internal contradiction is lighter (her “awkward confidence” rarely falters), but social cost (being “a joke”) shadows her actions. The closing choice to risk public failure to summon a collective response reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nana Marisol is vivid, competent, and motivated; her insurgent past and desire to “evolve tradition” clearly drive each action. Interiority is grounded in tactile beats (blistered digging, plant-whisper hum), but internal contradiction is light—she rarely doubts or pays a meaningful emotional price. The choice to plant is swift and largely uncontested. Still, micro‑choices align cleanly with her values and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motive to reclaim agency from trauma is clear, embodied, and particularized through tactile choices (stone, salt, lavender). Contradictory impulses surface in the flinch/flashback versus the deliberate grounding. A touch of therapy-speak (“somatic markers,” “PTSD”) edges toward label-y but is justified via Mrs. Voss and prior treatment. The earned shift—being able to view the photo without freezing—feels grounded in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictions (disdaining tarot yet tearing and grinding it into ink) reveal pressure and change. His micro‑choices—collecting threads, “redesigning his approach,” descending with a candle—track an earned shift from control to surrender. Embodied detail (smudged glasses, ribs aching, rough thread texture) grounds emotion. The cost is credible if quiet: he sacrifices prior certainties and tools to reweave meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is clear and persistent (find brother/understand the anomaly), with concrete micro‑choices (spilling the ink, confronting the elders’ claim by acting, engaging the child, opening the door). The “serene anger” reads specific and embodied through method and restraint rather than label alone. Internal contradiction is mild—resolve never wavers—so complexity is more tonal than decisional. Still, actions align tightly with motive and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear—her duty to the archive versus her need to expose suppressed truth—and her choice to revive Kael emerges credibly from that tension. Interiority is embodied (“ice crystals bloomed… cracking like a whispered secret”), and she makes concrete micro‑choices under pressure (sliding the letter into the panel, stepping back as fog forms). The internal conflict is present on the page rather than summarized, though some phrasing trends generic (“the truth matters”). Kael is sketched efficiently but remains reactive, limiting relationship dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s motives—tending the farm, translating her father’s credo into presence—are consistent and embodied in small, credible choices (embedding the scrap, repurposing the knife). The inheritance of violence versus pacifist practice gives her texture without grandstanding. Pressure is gentle; internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized, so the cost feels modest. Still, the final renunciation/acceptance reads earned for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive (catch the goddess’s echo to understand the constellations) is clear, consistent, and his calm, ritual competence drives the scene. Interiority is specific enough (bone‑deep hum, disciplined “voiced silence”), though internal contradiction is mild (cool‑headed focus under sorrow). His choices (adjusting the emitter, striking the spike, accepting the cost) align with his worldview. A deeper on‑page tug between desire for knowledge and the goddess’s palpable grief would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motives (truth vs. filial loyalty) are coherent and intensify under pressure, with the nib, the memo, and the overnight investigation revealing her contradictions. The discovery of “Don’t let Clara see this” lands a personal wound that credibly drives her choice to act against her family. Emotional states are embodied (the nib biting, breath hitching) rather than labeled. Slight convenience in her competence (a dossier in one night) trims the top end.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—transmuting inherited guilt into forgiveness—is clear and drives her choices from noticing the amber to reading the letter in the nursery. Embodied detail (needle as “silver quill,” trembling hands) grounds her interiority. However, her internal conflict resolves quickly once her mother’s voice appears; the struggle feels a shade too smooth for the stakes. Elara exerts limited pressure, so the crucible is mostly internal and could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s curiosity versus her protectiveness of the grotto’s “emergent hush” frames a credible internal conflict that tightens at “Interject.” Embodied details (knees damp with moss, chalk strokes) and a socially perceptive filter create a particular interiority. Her hesitation before inserting the tile reads as a real value trade. The final resolve toward “discover meaning” feels earned, if the on‑page cost remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s paradox (“gentle radical,” “aberrant mercy”) is clear, embodied by the tactile act of fitting the tessera. Interiority is vivid and specific (ash/ozone, artisan vision) and his choices align with motive. Internal conflict is more stated than dramatized, with little on‑page resistance beyond memory. The cost is largely conceptual—accepting loss—rather than a pressured sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (encore and repair) and a tactile interiority via synesthesia, but little contradictory impulse or friction on the page. Elias rarely meets resistance; his tactics work almost immediately. The cost (fading; coin blank) lands but doesn’t feel like a hard-won sacrifice. The flapper briefly pressures him, yet no sustained crucible tests his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—rejecting synthetic shortcuts to build an inner map—is clear, embodied (tingling wrist) and consistent. The relationship with Mara adds humane pressure and tests his stance without melodrama. Internal contradiction is mild (skeptic yet hopeful), limiting deeper fracture under stress. The closing commitment (“Then let’s show the world”) reads earned by the week of work and the geode’s “alignment.”

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lira’s motive (to decipher and become a “voice of the unknown”) is clear and coherently enacted through specific choices: activating the mapper, using algae, touching the fossil, and accepting the spores. Interiority is concrete and embodied (salt air, damp sand, pulse quickening), though internal contradiction is minimal—wonder largely eclipses doubt or fear. The final renaming from “map maker” to “translator” reads earned by prior beats. The visible cost is modest but present in the fossil’s sacrifice and the burden she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is clear and particular—unlock the jar to reforge fate—and actions align (methodical sorting, listening). Interiority is textured but low on contradiction; she rarely struggles or risks, which softens stakes. Micro‑choices (what to sort, how to listen) reveal a thoughtful temperament but little conflict. The final stance shift feels earned yet largely costless.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular: a burned spy seeking to “vouchsafe” her father’s transmission while confronting her hollowed courage. Interiority is textured with concrete memories (off‑key lullabies, pipe tobacco) and embodied actions (ink, quill, dirt). The contradiction—paranoia vs. the need to trust—surfaces credibly in the hesitation beat. The final stance shift is earned, though the epiphany edges tidy in its phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Distinct, steady interiority and tactile habits (yarn needle, river-sense) render Thaddeus specific, but he faces little contradictory impulse or cost. His motivations are clear yet reiterated rather than tested. The ferryman dynamic is evocative, though it never pressures a choice. The final stance reads as endurance rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—understanding why the oasis resists entropy—is clear and consistent, and her methodical choices (sun‑tracking, placing the glass, leaving with the lesson) align with a zen, tactile temperament. The mid‑story reveal that she planted the sunflowers decades ago deepens her character beyond a mere seeker into a quiet steward of hope. Internal contradiction is mild (poised serenity versus the latent fierceness of her younger self) and could carry more on‑page cost. The final renunciation—departing instead of claiming the oasis—lands as earned but emotionally low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—reflecting light into darkness—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (tapping a rhythm, deciding to visit Mara, giving away his talisman). His interiority is specific (fire-escape gardener, calloused hands, tool-as-talisman) and embodied. Internal contradiction is light; he rarely wavers, which softens pressure, but the gift of the gauge reads as a real, personal cost. Mara’s guardedness and gradual softening are credible in few strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motive—translate isolation into independence—is clear and consistently pursued, with embodied perception (vibrations, scents, the hum) grounding her interiority. The contradictory pull (longing for her chorus versus choosing solitude) is present but softened, yielding a relatively tidy epiphany. Her decisive actions—speaking to the images, palming the sundial, choosing to write—align with her stated aims. The cost of renunciation is felt but subdued, more elegiac than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s motive (to “rejoin” and find the thread) is clear and enacted through specific choices: touching the spiral, accepting Elara’s nudge, writing the secret. The embodied cost—hand trembling, chest tightening, tears—lands. Internal contradiction (professional concealment vs. personal hollowness) is present but resolves a touch neatly. The final resolve to change her practice feels earned if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lila’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her competency is balanced by fear and trembling hands; “No... But doing nothing guarantees failure” credibly frames her risk‑taking. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she’s mostly steady rather than torn. Hale adds gentle external pressure without hijacking focus. The final stance (“Then I’ll dam it”) reads earned if slightly slogan‑leaning.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives (retrieve the key despite claustrophobia) are clear and consistent, and his internal contradiction—prudence warring with the urge to leap—registers on the page. Embodied stress (shallow breath, pressing walls) keeps emotions concrete. His decisive choices (leaping into the corridor, stabbing the wall with the compass) align with his traits. The cost is mostly fear/endurance, with limited moral or relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s motive (to rehumanize the victim through empathy) is clear and enacted through specific choices: coming to the quarry, sketching the terrain, directing Voss to trace. Internal contradiction is mild—competence and intuition rarely collide—so stakes feel more principled than fraught. The Clara–Voss dynamic adds pressure and contrast in method. The closing renunciation of numbness is credible though lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clara’s motive—redeeming her great‑grandmother—drives concrete, escalating choices (deciphering, digging, defying evacuation). Interiority is specific (salt/ozone, brittle pages) and shows a live contradiction: fear threads through her insistence on acting. The director’s brief entrance gives external pressure that sharpens her stance. The cost remains mostly anticipatory rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motives (decode Marisol’s riddle, test the bridge‑song) are clear and consistent, and his skepticism tilting into belief reads earned. Interiority is particular (scent of resin/oil, noticing wind/shadows) and actions align with his musician’s identity. Internal contradiction exists but is light—curiosity vs. disbelief—so the final poised choice carries some charge but limited friction. The brief Marisol exchange hints at relationship stakes but arrives late and stays surface.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive and a lived link to the father’s legacy give Elias specificity, and his tactic of leaving bills shows values-in-action. Internal conflict is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. The final renunciation/peace reads earned but low-cost. More in-scene friction would deepen the contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirael’s motive (decode inscriptions/find brother) is clear and consistent, and her reluctance to “bear the weight” vs. need to act gives credible internal friction. The decisive choice to witness—surrendering detachment—lands with felt cost (etched verse, acceptance of others’ burdens). Veyra’s pressure is relevant and timely. A few lines lean toward platitude, softening the rawness of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motive (to uncover hidden truths) is clear and sustained, with credible embodied choices (entering the vortex, releasing the seed, breathing the spores). The contradiction—guarded druid who chooses to “unbend”—is dramatized rather than told. The self-reassessment around the killing reads earned, though the clarity via spores borders on convenient. Emotional cost is felt, if modestly contained for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear (reweave the covenant; find the intersection of dreams) and internal conflict (fear vs. “purposefully curious” drive) is dramatized via the scars and the doppelgänger’s indictment. The micro-choices—pressing the clipping to her palm, entering the maze, accepting pain—track. The cost is slightly soft on the page (loss/reconfiguration of scars and possible humanity is implied more than felt). The confrontation “Chasing isn’t heeding” crystallizes a credible flaw and its correction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motive (to patch her soul) and embodied internal conflict (recklessness versus a desired gentleness) drive concrete choices: surrendering the Fool, sewing the bones, eating the fruit. The keeper’s pressure sharpens her values without rescuing her. The epiphany risks neatness but is earned through tactile ritual and cost. Her change forecloses the path of unexamined certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lenny’s interiority is specific and embodied—the mildew, posters, and the ache he tries to smother with “facts” make a lived character. Contradictory impulses are active (urge to toss vs. refusal to betray), and his micro‑choices (researching the logo, calling the bassist) align with a credible shift. Status dynamics with Gus add pressure and reveal Lenny’s defensive humor. The change to “resurrecting forgotten stories” is earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional and modestly externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s kindly methodical drive and translator’s mindset are clear and motivate her choices (placing the seed, chanting). Interiority is specific (“Transition is not destruction… It’s… reassembly”) but skews declarative over conflicted. Limited contradictory impulses under pressure keep the arc quieter than it could be. The earned realization tracks, though the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear desires and micro‑choices: the woman hesitates, fears erasure, then dives; the librarian urges and facilitates, valuing “preserve the wonder.” Interiority is light and fable‑like rather than psychologically layered, but embodied detail (scales, feathers, gears) carries emotion. The cost—loss of prior self—registers in the transformed emergence and the feather kept. Relationship pressure exists but remains gentle, limiting depth of contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation and habits ground his motives, and his choice to surrender the pearl reads as a credible, value-driven act. Interiority is present and tactile (the respirator, the hum in his chest), but internal conflict is light—he shifts from inspector to conduit with little resistance. The “forgive” etching adds human particularity that narrows his options without melodrama. A clearer moment of doubt or competing duty could have heightened the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives are specific and embodied: a river chronicler off meds, methodically hunting graffiti for a path through guilt. Contradictory impulses (control vs. surrender; method vs. intuition) play out in action—following chalk, touching brick, playing the accordion. The interiority is textured and character‑particular, not generic therapy-speak. The final renunciation—choosing a meandering “river” path instead of a tidy map—feels earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s goal and methods are clear and consistent, and her embodied perceptions (mist on the shawl, watch humming) ground motivation. Internal contradiction is light—cautious exuberance flirts with fear, but there’s little on‑page cost or misstep. Her choices (to measure, decode, pull the marked book) align with the drive. The ending offers resolve without a palpable sacrifice, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑specific interiority and contradictory impulses (empire vs garden) play simultaneously in scene. Micro‑choices—touching the strings, whispering “Propagate,” reading the stain—reveal values under pressure. The renunciation reads earned and costly (“mulberry ache” remains). Minor safety in keeping all pressure internal keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—save Elion’s echo before it fades—and actions align under pressure. Interiority is specific in craft terms but internal contradiction is light; she’s nearly always competent, rarely torn. Embodied emotion appears (trembling fingers, racing heart), yet the risk doesn’t deeply destabilize her perception. The final embellishment choice reads earned, though the personal cost is mostly fatigue rather than a value trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motives (caretaking, need to understand contentment) are coherent and embodied through tactile choices—climbing, handling the shell, pinning the hairpin. The forgiveness backstory credibly tensions present trust, giving her final acceptance a felt (if gentle) cost. Interiority is concrete and specific; the fragility of trust is shown, not merely told. The arc is a quiet endurance/renunciation rather than a reversal, earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradiction—selling doubt yet risking clarity—reads specific and embodied (the cloak terrifies and exhilarates him). His micro‑choices (donning the cloak without waiting, unhooking a chime, offering Mira agency) align with motive. Mira is sketched well enough to exert pressure, though her interiority remains thinner. The cost is modest but legible: Elias exposes himself emotionally; Mira relinquishes a comforting certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to teach vanishing by withholding—tracks cleanly, and her backward‑aging adds a textured identity pressure. The mentor–apprentice dynamic is credible, with Lira’s mounting need pressing Elara’s restraint. Interiority is more lyric than conflicted, but the choice to let Lira struggle rather than explain supplies character specificity. The cost is subtle rather than felt as pain, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s drive is clear and embodied in disciplined observation and ritual, with the arrowhead and birds functioning as tools that reveal his worldview. However, his internal conflict is muted—he rarely wavers or contradicts himself—so the epiphany risks feeling preordained. The endurance cost (years of failure) is named but not tested on the page under acute pressure. Still, the final stance shift reads earned within this quiet frame.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—recovering meaning in a mechanized magic world—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (entering, pouring starlight, remaking the garden). His flaw (underachieving, theft of starlight) adds grain, though pressure on that flaw is light. Interiority is specific (childhood garden recollections) rather than label-only. The turn to “simplicity” lands, but conflicting impulses don’t bite hard enough to feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief-fueled quest is clear and embodied—his fixation on “the color of sound” ties to Lila’s last words and the key tag’s burn. His contradiction—hiding behind truth yet chasing a rumor—surfaces in action (choosing to enter the wreck). The final renunciation (“I see you now,” placing the key) feels earned though the emotional cost is quiet rather than harrowing. A touch of tidiness in the epiphany keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motive—decode the prophecy and align—stays clear and consistent, and his tactile engagement with coins and console reveals character. The internal arc from doubt to conviction lands but feels low‑friction and slightly preordained. Interiority is concrete but largely declarative in insight, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The resolution reads earned but light on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation (naming nameless fears after failing Lira) is clear and drives concrete choices. Interiority is embodied—dust, cold, trembling—while he proceeds despite warnings (“Do not name them”), showing contradiction under pressure. The whispered answer “Fear. And names.” is slightly on‑the‑nose but lands as a credible, stressed choice. The final stance shift—renewed purpose with felt cost—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s “lukewarm” power and brittle devotion are dramatized through tactile, incremental choices (tilting the bell, persisting as cracks widen). His naivete collides credibly with doubt (“And if you’re wrong?” / “He didn’t know.”). Embodied cost (shaking hands, exhaustion) grounds the interiority. Marla’s pressure is credible and reframes his stubbornness without flattening him.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s vigilance and conflicted relationship with memory are concrete and embodied through tactile choices (the tin of photographs, the kneeling at the moss). The encounter with Elias’s daughter adds relational pressure that forces a revaluation rather than a neat affirmation. The final choice—to place her own photo and pivot from guarding to sharing—feels earned by prior beats. Slight neatness in the epiphany via the daughter’s exposition softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive (balance over power) and her contradiction (logician’s rigor versus poet‑mother’s wonder) are embodied in concrete choices, especially the hand‑in‑flame act. Interiority is specific to her craft and sensibility (hearing the crystal’s hum, reading the starlings). The epiphany edges toward explicit thesis (“to harmonize… was not to choose”) but is largely earned by action. A visible cost (charred fingertips) seals a credible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s duty, maternal legacy, and tactile problem‑solving create a coherent, embodied motivation under pressure. Interiority is concrete (listening with hands; sweat, breath, tremor), but contradictory impulses are light—he rarely hesitates or fails. The “trust” motif personalizes the stakes yet edges toward tidy resolution. Final endurance choice (continuing the watcher’s work) reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (defeat numbness, defend existence) drives choices, and the on‑page decision to integrate rather than out‑muscle shows growth under pressure. Interiority is concrete enough (ego‑death memory, tactile engagement with the jar) though a few lines lean generic (“like a knife through butter”). Status dynamics with the clone are legible and shift as Kael seizes initiative. The final endurance/merging feels earned with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s curiosity and maker’s mindset are clear and consistent, and his actions (planting, investigating, following the trail) align with those motives. Interiority is specific enough to feel lived (“calloused from soldering circuits and carving wood”), with a credible flash of panic when the pot is empty. Internal contradiction is light; he rarely feels torn beyond a brief anxiety spike. The closing conceptual pivot (“stop forcing”) is earned but modest in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlowe’s motive is clear and embodied—he aches to restore laughter—and his persistence under pain gives him contour. Interiority is specific (blisters, hoarseness, trembling), though internal contradiction is light; he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses beyond fatigue. His micro-choices (starting the machine, aiming at the walls, singing louder despite pain) align with motive and show cost. The endurance at the end reads earned, if a touch single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives (oath vs. homesickness) and tactics (waiting, “interiorizing exteriors”) are concrete and drive her micro‑choices. Her contradictory impulses are on the page: desire to return home versus duty to protect, crystallized at the fountain. Dialogue reveals status tilt (cultist’s taunts vs. her controlled silence) and distinct idiom. The cost could register more viscerally, but her renunciation choice reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motives are legible and escalate credibly from repair to self-cost, with embodied stress (bleeding hands, trembling fingers). His internal contradiction—stoic endurance vs. sensitivity that absorbs failure—drives the climactic choice to pour essence. Micro-choices (spiral→web→cage; hesitation at the crack) reveal value hierarchy. A few thesis-like lines edge toward declarative, but they grow from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive and method are clear and embodied (the headset bite, the searing shard), and his agency drives each turn. However, internal contradiction is light—he “knows better” early, so doubt and competing impulses are minimal. The mantra “Discard assumptions” helps, but the epiphany skirts the edge of pre‑decided. Still, his micro‑choices (dismantling, retuning, lifting the shard) align with a credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motive (complete the passengers’ journeys) is clear, pressured, and tested by the risk of unraveling reality. His resilient optimism falters credibly at “Let us merge. Let us finish,” yielding a real internal trade-off. Micro-choices—tuning the radio, shifting from signal to pattern, asking for trust—reveal hierarchy of values. Complexity is strong for the length, though the inner conflict resolves a touch neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clara’s motive is clear and consistent—she seeks “rational enchantment” and tests it through action. Interiority is present but leans abstract, with few contradictory impulses or embodied, idiosyncratic details under pressure. Her key micro-choices (weaving, continuing through fear, stepping through the door) align with motive. The change at the end reads credible but pays a relatively light emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motive—feeling adrift yet yearning to “navigate by starlight”—is clear and embodied via the rusted chain link. Her micro‑choices (staying late, taking the class to the edge, reframing the chain as a tool) align with that drive. Internal conflict is present but soft; insights lean declarative rather than dramatized under pressure. The students, Tarel included, apply only light relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motive—protecting vulnerable voices—drives clear micro‑choices (kneeling at the fountain, following the pulse, presenting the message). Interiority is sensorial and particular, not generic. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance and rarely wavers. The emotional cost lands but is modest, more tenderness than real fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s claustrophobia versus her drive to redeem her brother’s absence creates credible, embodied pressure (“breath came in shallow gasps,” walls pressing in). Micro-choices under stress (descending anyway, slapping the fleck on the terminal, leaving with the codex) align with her motive. A slight convenience glosses over the leap from cryptic margin note to operational use of the technology. Still, the endurance and renunciation at the end feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, embodied interiority with the heartbeat compulsion and the shard ritual giving texture to motive; his refusal to “choose” reads as an earned endurance. The contradiction (alive/dead) is held in scene via OBS-7’s pressure, not just told. Cost is present—he forgoes erasure and accepts the ghost—but it’s more conceptual than viscerally felt. A touch more friction in his hesitation or a misstep under stress would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and specific—she wants to translate texture into sound—and her tactics evolve under pressure from observation to risky activation to renunciation. The fear of oblivion surfaces credibly at the peak and reframes her earlier rigor. The final act (throwing the diamond) is an earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor ding: internal contradiction could be threaded earlier, not only revealed at the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and contradiction are clear: document the cryptid versus the seduction of shedding identity. Her embodied reactions (the handset to her chest, bark sprouting, leaves in her voice) feel particular and pressured. The final renunciation—choosing to return human yet altered in purpose—reads earned by the prior pull. Slight abruptness in “not as a researcher” softens the psychological afterburn but doesn’t break credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motive and tactics are clear and embodied—pressing the shell to her chest, then to the crack, then to her lips—showing escalating commitment with physical cost (bleeding fingers, snapped string). Interiority is specific to her sensory logic (heart rhythms, vibrations), though the final realization edges toward stated moral. Contradictory impulses surface lightly (fear vs. insistence), but conflict could push her into a starker trade-off. Still, actions align with motive and culminate in an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s curiosity and “respectfully rebellious” streak motivate the illicit handoff cleanly, and his interior lens on borders as gaps carries through. Contradictory impulses (caution vs. transgression) are present but lightly dramatized. The risk/cost of smuggling remains underplayed on the page (no concrete reprisal or sacrifice shown). Still, micro-choices align with character and culminate in a credible, modest reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elio’s motive—interpreting silence as possibility—drives clear, tactile choices (searching, listening, singing). Interiority is specific and embodied through craft details and sensory attention. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are minimal; he meets little resistance. The final shift feels earned but comfortable rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s motives—restlessness to “reawaken” stories—are clear and embodied through tactile choices (keeping the scarf, staying after hours, tracing diagrams). Her interiority is specific and consistent, with a credible contradiction between librarian rigor and mystical risk-taking. The change to quiet authority the next morning reads earned if low-cost. The only ding is the absence of significant on‑page resistance to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to capture a runaway dream—is clear and sustained, with embodied ritual (the dawn climb, the palette) revealing temperament. Contradictory impulses (fear it’s too late vs. relentless hope) surface in action rather than label. The shift from pursuit to acceptance reads earned via the dream’s on‑page appearance. The visible cost is subtle but present: she forecloses the chase and empties her palette.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motive—unlocking a feared truth—drives concrete choices (traveling to the nexus, working the locket) and a credible internal tension (defying the woman’s wishes vs. his compulsion to reveal). Embodied beats (trembling fingers, heart racing, clinging to the wall) ground his interiority. The contradiction “unassumingly bold” reads on the page through risk-taking without bravado. The late epiphany leans stated rather than fully dramatized, slightly reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s obsession, age, and skepticism-to-wonder arc are clear and embodied (aching knees, ritual precision, dream pressure). His micro-choices—mapping the caps, prying the mushroom, staying as the tide rises—align with motive and reveal values. Internal contradiction (skeptical folklorist vs. believer in “quiet magic”) is present but not deeply stressed. The final endurance choice carries cost but could cut sharper against a competing value for maximal edge.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s habits (walking backward, shard-mirror avoidance) and vocation concretize a distinct psychology, and the visitor’s need is clean and urgent. Interiority is embedded in action (tea-leaf geometry, annotating), with a credible, quiet authority. The final decision belongs to the visitor, but it’s earned by Lirael’s method and stance. Cost is gestured rather than deeply felt, keeping this short of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystal clear—preserve the orchard’s fading wonder—and her actions track that drive with tactile specificity (sap, meteorite blade, incantations). Interiority is grounded in craft and sensation rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; Elara rarely wavers or pays a personal, value‑based price beyond the seed’s loss. The competence‑forward path flattens pressure on her character at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motive (to ground the spirits and “exhume the truth”) is clear, and her fear of “what I’ll find” creates a credible internal contradiction under pressure. Her embodied work with the needle shows micro-choices and persistence. The relationship with Elias adds gentle pressure but rarely forces a hard trade-off. The ending shift to “Now you listen” is earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional and soft.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (“Reopen the silence”) is clear and consistently pursued through concrete micro‑choices (comparing reels, aligning the sextant, listening, using holy water). Interiority is tactile and character‑particular (map framer’s eye; rain/fresco filters). Internal friction is present but mild—his pause at the tear’s edge hints at doubt without testing him hard. The closing repricing reads earned, though the personal cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—reframing grief through physics—is clear, character‑specific, and drives her choices. The intellectual method (algorithms, frequency matching) reveals her temperament under pressure. Internal contradiction surfaces in her attempt to “let go” while pursuing preservation via transmission. Cost is felt in the reframed endurance of grief, though it remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to speak what he cannot say aloud—drives every micro‑choice (who he writes to, the symbols he chooses, his refusal to stop in the rain). Interiority comes through action rather than labels, and grief/guilt (for brother, for Lira) gives the work weight. The contradiction (fear of speaking vs. insistence on encoding) is present but not stressed to a breaking point. The cost remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see a consequential risk beyond vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s inquisitiveness drives concrete choices—opening the diary, donning the goggles, and deciding to hand both to the widow—showing a coherent, character‑specific motive. Status dynamics flicker in the brief exchange; she gains subtle leverage without breaking role. Internal contradiction is present but soft; her risk in defying the ban on the crash is implied more than dramatized. The closing stance (“I ascend.”) reads earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, with tactile interiority (the brass cold on her palm, the journal entries) and a credible personal wound. Her final stance—accepting that the proof may not change the world but will change her—reads as an earned renunciation. Internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers beyond grief and resolve. Voss adds pressure but their dynamic shifts little beyond skepticism to grudging regard.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motives are clear and character‑particular (face‑blind artist who “memorized souls through textures”), and her choices (opening the panel, choosing to paint, taking the safe) align under pressure. Curiosity vs. caution appears but resolves quickly, with limited on‑page inner friction at peak beats. Embodied perception is strong; emotional contradiction could be sharper as the wrecking begins. The final stance (preservation over place) is credible though not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s curiosity is vivid and drives concrete choices (decoding the hopscotch, leaping), with embodied attention to tools and patterns. Internal contradiction is light—she moves from inquiry to risk with minimal hesitation, so the cost reads more assumed than wrestled with. Jax provides mild relational pressure but doesn’t force a hard trade-off. The final stance (defying the captain to pursue discovery) is earned but not deeply contended.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, coherent motivation with tactile interiority—nostalgia, pressure of legacy, and a credible craft‑driven mindset. The mirror beat briefly shows doubt vs. determination, but contradictions don’t compound and stress never degrades perception. Competence outweighs struggle, minimizing visible cost. Still, the micro‑choices (spotting the wrong reflection, using the vial, working the lock) align tightly with his trait set.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive is crystalline and consistent, and her agency (the chalk messages, gathering, and speech) drives the action. We glimpse an interior check—she reexamines her approach—which adds a sliver of vulnerability. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or visible flaw; her saintliness limits dynamic tension. The final endurance/change reads earned but low‑cost, more affirmation than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear, consistent motive (“vouchsafe the final ripple”) with embodied detail (calloused hands, rusted railing). Internal conflict (doubt/fear vs. duty) surfaces but remains streamlined; a sharper contradictory impulse in-scene would deepen complexity. Micro-choices—placing the head, pressing the palm, continuing to sing as things crack—track well to motive. The acceptance of flaw reads earned through the grandfather thread.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s reluctance versus duty is concrete and embodied (his hatred of the birds, the nut biting his palm) and his micro‑choices under pressure reveal values. The internal contradiction (resenting the task yet risking the curse) stays live through the climax. Slight limitation: interior conflict is observed more than friction-tested in dialogue or with the traveler, so ambiguity doesn’t deepen mid‑scene. Still, the final shove—“Go”—reads as earned endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (atoning for silence, seeking reconnection) is clear and consistently filtered through her polymer/river lexicon. Interiority is specific and embodied (foam, surfactants, braided channels) rather than generic. The sister dynamic lands, though the reconciliation comes a touch smoothly with limited resistance on the page. Still, her micro‑choices (sampling foam, replying to the text, offering the chrysalis) align with motive and reveal values.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—seeking where stories begin—is clear and embodied in her trade; giving up her prized jar is a credible, value-revealing choice. Interiority registers in tactile, character‑specific ways (fingertips on glass, fixation on the knife). Internal contradiction is light: unease vs. principle shows, but she isn’t truly tested beyond parting with the moonlight. The man exerts immediate but brief pressure; the relationship dynamic is intriguing yet underused.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nessar’s motive—to blunt cutting memories—drives every choice, and his interior stakes (“wondered if he was simply becoming entangled in it”) register with concrete, sensory embodiment. The freeze at the guard’s steps, the deliberate palm-press ritual, and finally submerging deeper show micro-choices under pressure. The cost of absorbing guilt (“legs unsteady,” tingling tongue) lands credibly. A slightly sharper in-scene contradiction at peak (hesitation vs compulsion) could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑particular, and her methods align with her empathetic decisiveness. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she never wavers or pays a discernible personal price. Micro‑choices (language shifts, soldering) show competence more than struggle. The resolution reads earned but low‑friction emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and sustained: to repair the mirror and entangle himself with the canyon’s stored memories as a way to remake a self after professional collapse. Interiority is particular (tools, tactile adjustments, tremor at the voice), and actions align with his “chaotically precise” nature. The internal contradiction (ambition to merge vs. fear of being overwhelmed) surfaces but is managed quickly, softening felt cost. Still, his micro-choices under pressure (dialing feedback, persisting through bleed) reveal character credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—hunting “seeds of vigilance” via marginalia—drives concrete choices under time pressure. Interiority is vivid and particular (“prism‑minded archivist,” tactile tracing of grooves), with embodied fear during inversion. However, contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond hurry and risk. The identity shift to “keeper of thresholds” is credible but lightly earned emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive is vivid and consistent—she refuses silence and works until “her nails bled.” Interiority is sensorial and particular (listening with bones), but there's little on‑page contradiction or competing impulse to complicate the pursuit. Micro‑choices (tool repurposing, analysis of fissures, persistence through pain) align with motive. The ending forecloses comfort (she loses the insulator) but doesn’t expose deeper flaw confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Alaric’s motive—redeeming the abandoned covenant through the rigor of his chess‑tuned mind—is consistent and specific, with embodied moments (teeth ache, cold stone) grounding his resolve. The “thoughtfully precise” trait shapes tactics and carries social cost via exile and past mockery. Internal contradiction is light but present (his prior dismissal of the riddle versus his surrender to silence). The closing choice to use Lira’s key and plant the seed reads earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (to decode familial silence) and embodied pursuit through tactile action; the pacifist/listener identity coheres with the resonance tactic. Internal conflict is light—she flinches at fireworks but persists—so contradiction under pressure is modest. The shift from curiosity to empathy is earned via reading the entries, though some trait labels read told rather than dramatized. Still, micro‑choices (method shift, patient attunement) reveal values credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (harmonize the village) and a credible internal tension between ambition and patience. Embodied, character‑specific perception through scent grounds her decisions. The grandmother dream as catalyst feels a touch convenient but still coheres with her heritage motif. The final renunciation of rushing reads earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Lira seeks the planet’s resilience source—and her choices (following the river, inserting the tip) align. Interiority is present but largely functional; contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear or exploitation vs. protection) are gestured at rather than dramatized. The final renunciation-to-protect lands but carries limited felt cost on the page. Competence dominates over struggle, keeping the arc clean but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (mentor’s death, professional rigor) drives her method and the choice to climb, with embodied perception (“boots crunching,” sensor adjustments). Internal contradiction is light—she rarely falters—so the emotional cost reads more as focused endurance than a riven dilemma. The on‑page micro‑choices (cross‑referencing, climbing despite hazards) align with motive and reveal competence under pressure. The late interaction with the engineer briefly tests status dynamics but doesn’t deepen a relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s goal is clear and embodied in concrete action (lifting the bell, pressing the amber sheet, choosing to sing via aurora). Interiority is particular (synesthetic perceptions), but internal contradiction and visible cost are light. Veyra’s skeptic-to-believer pivot registers but doesn’t pressure Lira’s choices on the page. The final stance feels earned, if tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motive—“to harvest insights from failure”—is dramatized through specific, pressured choices (playing, descending, risking a discordant attempt, then accepting surrender). Contradictory impulses are live: grief and fear versus duty and curiosity. The visible cost (snapped reeds) and the final renunciation (etching a surrender rune) make the change earned. Minor archetypal tint remains, but interiority stays concrete and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s rationalist compulsion is clear and specific, and his flaw (treating emotion as solvable math) credibly drives his choices. The empathy overload sequence forces a believable reversal with visible cost (detachment crumbling, tears). Veyra applies focused pressure without stealing agency. The epiphany is a touch tidy, but it feels earned by the on‑page ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kail’s contradictory impulses—jitter and suspicion vs. the pendant’s pull and lingering loyalty to Veyra—surface in concrete micro‑choices (to stop, to accept the vial, to plant). Interiority is specific and embodied (“strap of his leather satchel,” “breath misted”), not label‑speak. The final reconfiguration (he is “soil”) is earned by prior beats, though the realization risks neatness. The cost is primarily conceptual (relinquishing doubt and the pendant’s active guidance), which keeps the impact intimate rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s goal and flaw (yearning for proof/validation) are clear and pressure her choices from the first move to the renunciation at the end. Interiority is embodied and specific (cold seeping, mist answering) with a credible moment of self-doubt before the turn. The final acceptance costs her her theory and the validation she sought, which reads earned. A couple lines edge toward tidy thesis (“It already held the weight of the world”), but they’re supported by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—to mend silence and honor a generational charge—drives every choice, culminating in a real forfeiture of her grandmother’s bead. Interiority is sensory and particular (calloused fingers, the loom’s creak), with credible persistence and loneliness. The internal contradiction (keeping her inheritance vs. letting it go) sharpens at the end and lands. Minor reliance on summary (“years ago,” “for weeks”) slightly dilutes in‑scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jorin’s motivation is clear and consistent—quiet resolve to save Veyra—and his choices (entering the mines, choosing the center tunnel, enduring the shards) align with that trait. Interiority is serviceable but limited; there’s little contradictory impulse beyond fear versus resolve. The embodied cost (blood, cuts) adds credibility, though the struggle feels relatively untroubled by doubt. Lira functions more as a guide than a source of relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motive—pursuing a withheld truth about his mother—drives every beat and culminates in an earned renunciation with visible cost (giving up the shard and the possibility of answers). Interiority is concrete and filtered through tactile details (visor hum, ozone, warming shard), and contradictory impulses (compulsion vs. caution, longing vs. warning) coexist. The mother-figure’s presence sharpens the crucible without stealing agency. Slight neatness in the final emotional calibration (“the weight was gone”) trims complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s skepticism yields to participation, and that softening reads through embodied, trade‑off choices (stacking stones, placing the glass). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular—salt, iron, creaks—rather than label‑speak. Internal tension (dismissal vs. curiosity/need) is present but remains quiet; the cost is largely conceptual (accepting a lesser, communal light). The endurance at the end feels earned for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct, embodied protagonist with clear motive and ritual competence; “Laughing Storm Herald” is a vivid, character‑specific angle. Interiority leans to confidence with only light contradiction (awe vs. apprehension) rather than deep internal conflict. Micro‑choices (wick adjustments, stepping to the edge, timing the release) align with motive. The closing stance—choosing to shape dawn—feels earned but pays a modest emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lin’s motive (to understand why some people “magnetize stories”) is clear and character‑particular, and the donor‑heart split gives her a palpable interior contradiction. Her key choice—releasing the wing and later committing her days to illuminating stories—aligns with those motives. The struggle is mostly internal and contemplative; pressure rarely forces messy, contradictory impulses on the page. Cost registers through the wing’s loss and a life‑long vow, but the emotional price could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives—maintaining rituals, decoding the sextant, reaching the trees’ memory—are clear and consistent, with grounded occupational texture. Interiority is specific (hand on damp stone, wound knitting), though contradiction under pressure is faint; he rarely wavers or pays a visible price. Micro‑choices (dismantling the sextant, stopping the mapping, stepping through the wall) reveal values but lack a sharp internal clash. The final acceptance reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive (rekindle a dying realm) and consistent agency (using the mica window and humming) carry the piece. However, Lira faces little on‑page resistance and shows minimal contradictory impulse or cost beyond fatigue and loneliness. Interiority is specific and embodied but rarely conflicted. The final stance (keep humming) is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s motive (to hide while seeking her mother’s wisdom) is clear and sustained, with a credible contradiction that pays off: she wants invisibility yet longs to be seen. Micro-choices—whispering the password, approaching the blank book, following the map—align with her traits. The final renunciation (staying, admitting she’s lost) reads earned, though pressure is mostly gentle and externally guided. Interiority is concrete and avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—seeking the sacred in the ordinary—is coherent and embodied through specific, gentle choices (hesitating over the bread; planting instead). Interiority is textured without therapy-speak, and the pause before touching the impossible loaf shows credible contradiction. The change to quiet stewardship and acceptance is earned but the cost is soft. The old woman’s brief presence adds validation rather than pressure, keeping character conflict relatively low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and trait set (“orderly,” “gently meticulous”) are cleanly dramatized in tool use and note-taking, and her frustration spikes credibly. Internal contradiction is modest—methodical patience versus the urgency to hurry—surfacing when she accelerates sampling. Emotional embodiment (“quartz hush,” fist on desk) reads particular rather than generic. The endurance choice lands, though the cost is mostly fatigue and strain rather than a sharper sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motives are clear and consistent—protect the market’s “hush” economy and thwart the buyer—while Lira’s stubborn resolve is dramatized through missteps and the final smash. Interiority is concrete (the fob, the smell of brine/opium) and her cost—cracking the inherited watch and risking her father’s myth—lands. The brief seller scene efficiently shows status dynamics and pressure. A touch more live contradiction in the bell‑chamber beat (fear vs. duty) could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s drive (to test the compass and decode “people who carry weather”) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile, sensory choices. Interiority is specific (taste‑based perception, the ring’s heat) but his contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. wonder) stay relatively muted on the page. Lira adds pressure and reframes meaning but does not force a hard choice. The closing regret is earned, if quiet, with a light on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: he’s there to unlock suppressed creativity, and the lock/painting ritual reveals him under pressure. We get concrete interiority (trembling fingers, ache in the chest), but contradictory impulses could be sharper; fear and desire rarely collide in a way that forces a costed trade. The final shift to “felt truly seen” lands, though it borders on tidy. More friction between the coin-portraits life and the risk of failure would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and constant, and her lie‑sensing quill productively shapes her choices. Interiority is concrete in tactile ways (ink, moss, breath), and her confrontation with the keeper feels earned. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, so the emotional cost reads more conceptual than embodied. A hair more ambivalence or visible sacrifice at the orb would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving wonder through silence and sound—is clear and embodied in concrete choices (finding the ice, building the sculpture, striking the bell). Interiority is understated but specific to her craft; we feel her vow in action rather than self‑explanation. The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses under pressure, so the change reads as serene endurance rather than charged conflict. Still, the cost of letting the iceberg melt away gives her stance credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara-7’s motive—contain chaos before it overwhelms her and the farm—is clear and consistently escalated by the magnetic shift. Interiority is particular to an android body (“optics flickered,” “joints creaking”), and her nostalgic lean toward old Earth records individualizes her. The pivotal choice to burn the box and absorb the orb reads earned by her controlled-burn memory. The cost—keeping residual static and ache—grounds the change in credible imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motive—curiosity filtered through reverence for objects—drives each step cleanly, and her actions align with that identity. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she never faces a value‑testing trade‑off beyond gentle persistence. Secondary characters add texture, not pressure. The emotional cost registers at the end but remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive (liberate the scientist’s truth/antidote) is clear and his choices—mirroring the dance, using the dice, facing the drones—align with it. Interiority is vivid and character‑particular (“translating her grief into equations”), though internal contradiction is light; he rarely hesitates or frays. The admiration for the scientist gives him texture, but his peak choice carries minimal visible emotional cost. Overall, strong but short of the deepest ambivalence or rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motive is clear and propulsive—recovering what gravity took—and his choices (reading grounds, opening the panel, placing flowers) align with it. Interiority is specific (boots crunching salt, the tactile talisman of pressed flowers) and largely embodied. The emotional turn from fear to purpose lands but feels a touch tidy, with limited felt friction around his wife’s absence. A sharper cost or contradiction at the end would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.6)
    Her motivation is clear and consistent, and small micro‑choices (placing the wing, regulating breath, committing to the ritual) track. However, there’s little contradictory impulse under pressure; she never wavers or risks a wrong tactic. The seer backstory informs motive but doesn’t complicate it in scene. The final endurance costs her only the wing, not a felt internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s intellectual curiosity and skepticism are clear, and his micro‑choices (waiting, placing the seal down, choosing to “lie” to the building) track with his vocation. Interiority is particular (“language… felt… from his bones”), and the relationship dynamics with the woman carry subtext. Internal contradiction is modest; he moves from caution to commitment quickly with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s contradictions (“charmed skeptic,” “tragically radiant”) are dramatized in tactile choices—kneeling in soil, arranging shell halves, enduring the child‑voice question. The embodied cost registers in the ash of the roses and the silenced shell, not just declarations. A minor softness: the final certainty borders on tidy. Still, the internal turn reads earned by on‑page action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motive—“calibrated treason” as forgiveness—reads specific and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (the blood prick, the spiral cipher, placing the scroll). Interiority is textured and embodied (trembling fingers, aching joints) without therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction (forgery as lie vs. moral repair) is present but meets little on‑page opposition, softening pressure. The Earned Stasis/renunciatory note at the end feels credible though not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motive to learn why some people echo is clear and drives his ascent, hand‑off of the shell, and final recommitment to sing. Interiority is textured but low on contradiction; he rarely wrestles with competing impulses beyond wonder and urgency. The choice to surrender the shell and accept the burden of listening reads as earned but lightly priced. The hooded figure adds dimension but doesn’t force a difficult relational choice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motive and modus operandi are clear and consistent, and his choices (reading dreams; placing the globe; opting to “weave” truth) align with a careful, listening temperament. Interiority is particular and embodied via ice, candles, breath, and the globe. However, internal contradiction and on‑page pressure are mild; he encounters little resistance or cost beyond quiet ache. The result is credible but not deeply crucible‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motives are coherent and character‑specific—the net‑mender/philosopher who attends to “hidden effort”—and his micro‑choices (following the whistle, using the whisk to trace rhythm) reveal him well. Interiority is textured and embodied through work and sensory attention. However, internal contradiction and felt cost remain modest; the epiphany lands a touch tidy without a competing impulse or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motive (truth excavation) is clear and consistent, and her investigative competence drives choices. Interiority is particular (pattern-thinking, tactile puzzle work) but the internal contradiction at the peak (“hesitated” before the pedestal) is brief and lightly priced. The final renunciation (giving up the diamond/power) feels earned but its personal cost could be sharper. No relationship crucible on-page limits complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motives (isolation vs. compulsion to decode the storm) are clear and drive concrete micro‑choices—tuning the rig, activating the prism mechanism. Interiority is textured and embodied (“his handwriting as erratic as the lightning”), though the internal contradiction doesn’t quite culminate in a visibly costly decision. The acceptance of “prophet/seer and storm” reads earned but the personal price is soft. Still, character comes through as particular and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (to “sweeten” and translate between generations) and embodied reaction when the lullaby plays land well; Elias reads particular. However, internal contradiction is mild—little friction beyond wistful longing—so the final stance costs him little beyond prior loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motives (protect the key; uphold family legacy) are clear and drive concrete micro-choices under pressure. His contradiction—engineer of equations yet moved by the key’s “song”—is embodied in tactile beats (gloved hands on dials, knees buckling). The cost registers physically and ethically in the harmonizing choice rather than domination. Slight safety lies in how smoothly he calibrates to “sonic absolution” without more visible doubt or risk of error.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motive—unyoking power through patience—stays coherent, with a credible tension between haste and discipline (the failed first attempt and his self‑check of “Patience”). Embodied details (aching back, breath fog, filings’ behavior) ground emotion. The endurance/change is modest but earned: he renounces hurry for fine, repeated adjustments at cost of fatigue and time. Secondary figures apply light validation rather than pressure, keeping the arc largely internal but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s motive (expose Cole, reclaim agency) is clear and enacted through concrete choices (lighting the lantern, searching, reading, deciding). Interiority is specific enough—watchful calm undercut by tremor—though a few tell-y lines (“She’d been a fool”) flatten complexity. The off-page antagonist limits relational pressure on the page. The final stance crystallization feels earned, if emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Marcus’s motivation is clear and consistent: verify the program’s purpose and decide what to endorse. His interiority is credible and rooted in sensibility (“aptly deliberate”), with the clockwork heart revealing a softer, morally attentive core. The change—committing to turn apology into action—feels earned, though the internal conflict remains gentle rather than pressure‑driven. Mrs. Elms applies light but effective interpersonal pressure without dominating the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s motive is vivid and specific (to ring an unheard bell), and her obsession with the arrow tip drives concrete choices. Interiority is textured (“gears with feet,” scoffing at Thrum, trembling at the image) without therapy‑speak. A credible cost appears when she sacrifices the tip, though internal contradiction (risk versus attachment to the artifact) could be sharpened further. Overall, motivation and micro‑choices align cleanly with the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s goal and tactics are clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (digging past restrictions, cracking encryption, confronting Hale, uploading coordinates). Interiority is present but largely functional; she shows little contradictory impulse or visible doubt under pressure. Hale functions as thin external pressure rather than a complex relational crucible. The final renunciation (choosing flight over compliance) feels earned but light on embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to quell a fear‑storm by reconstituting empathy—is coherent and tracked through embodied choices (ascending to the attic, walking the mirrors, deploying the shard). Her competence is compelling, but internal contradiction is light; doubt or misgiving barely surfaces, so cost feels muted. The “shadow‑laced peacekeeper” texture reads specific, not a stock label. Peak‑moment emotions are earned but not deeply torn.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motives and contradictions are vivid: an euthanasia tourist seeking numbness who nevertheless lunges into a rescue. The parasol tip choice under pressure reveals character without speechifying. Embodied details (cold seeping, grip tightening) ground her detachment. The final “flicker of peace” feels earned, though the cost remains mostly internal and modest.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—quietly nurturing understanding—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (approach, offering the letter, walking). Lila’s blockage is specific and embodied in her abandoned easel and “feeling nothing.” Interiority is present but relatively light; contradictions (Elias’s persuasive reserve vs. intervention) could be pushed harder under pressure. The change—Lila’s small, earned openness—tracks, though the cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motive—preserve the echo—drives concrete choices, and her “strange honesty” carries a small relational cost when the prophet recoils. Interiority is present via her peripheral awareness but remains mostly functional rather than richly contradictory. The prophet is thinly sketched, applying little counter‑pressure beyond ritual collaboration. The final endurance—she will keep walking the line—reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motive (transmuting grief into art) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (sketching, pocketing the feather, writing “enough,” returning with film) align with it. The interiority is specific to her craft and eye for arcs, though the internal conflict remains gentle and largely unopposed. The acceptance turn is credible but pays a modest, mostly conceptual cost (relinquishing the need for a singular “masterpiece”). Depth would rise with a sharper contradiction or a concrete price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular interiority: a reticent scholar whose tactile habits (brushing spines, pacing, feeling the crystal warm) ground his motives. The internal conflict—habitual silence versus the urge to “testify”—is credible and culminates in a choice to share his findings. The cost (risk of colleagues’ dismissal) is present though softly felt. Change reads earned through accumulated noticing rather than forced epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s desire to “capture the sound of growing older” is clear, embodied through ritual and small, stubborn choices (the driftwood, the chalk). The precognitive forgetfulness constrains tactics and produces credible frustration. The final renunciation (“didn’t need to see the future anymore”) reads earned, though his contradictory impulses could be pressured more on the page. The felt cost is present but mild (raw hands, time lost), keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motive—to harness the ephemeral—drives each choice, and his competence reads earned through tactile craft (ear trumpet, soldering, singing to match pitch). Internal contradiction is present but light: the keeper who tries to tame time is forced to leap into the unknown he can’t control. Under peak pressure, emotion is embodied (bone‑deep vibration, ozone, trembling) but the struggle resolves quickly via insight, trimming complexity. A richer on‑page cost to what he leaves (relationships, past failures) would deepen the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—execute a flawless goodbye—and her interiority is grounded in tactile details (vinyl shard, lavender, her mother). The personal echo with her mother adds contradiction to her serenity, giving the fierce/soft duality weight. Minor idealization (nearly flawless equanimity) limits depth of flaw under pressure. Still, micro-choices (when to hum, what to say to Clara) feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—Lirael wants to solve the sealed awakenings and “find where shadows go at noon,” and her choices (waiting for the Weeping Archer, inserting the key) align with that. Interiority is focused and professional with a credible patience; the three sleepless nights add lived cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal and tension comes more from the clock than from conflicted impulse. The closing realization doesn’t force a new moral calculus for her, keeping the arc solid but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s skepticism and curiosity drive credible choices, and her embodied reactions (“throat tightened,” “hand trembled”) keep her human under pressure. The relationship with Elias functions as a crucible that complicates and then redirects her plan. The shift toward forgiveness feels earned but a touch tidy. A clearer on‑page cost for the sacrifice would have deepened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—honoring her mother by crafting and then returning light—drives clear micro‑choices (selection, polishing, weighing, release). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific; the “loan vs gift” frame creates a credible renunciation. Internal contradiction is subtle (crafting to keep vs releasing to share) but present. The cost—letting the pearl go—reads as an earned endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s fear of “losing him twice” versus her urge to graft meaning produces credible, embodied choice when she unclaspes the pendant and asks Elias to stay. Elias reads slightly idealized—gentle facilitator without visible edge—which softens interpersonal pressure. Micro-choices (stone‑placing, pendant opening, inviting him) align with motive and escalate vulnerability. The change is earned, with a felt cost in exposing the pendant’s contents.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s motive (to solemnize an ending and interrogate her tidy closures) is clear and evolves into a choice with cost (deleting the “neat” final chapter). Her contradictions—skeptic of omens yet drawn to the seashell’s pull—surface in embodied ways. The double’s pressure and the shell’s warmth elicit micro‑choices that reveal values. Slight on‑the‑nose guidance from the double (“endings aren’t walls—they’re doors”) trims subtlety but doesn’t undercut earning.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—to revive fading magic and sacred practices—is consistent and enacted through concrete choices (climbing, playing, recruiting the community). Interiority is present but largely unconflicted; she faces ache and endurance rather than a thorny trade‑off. The clearest cost is the tendril’s depletion and her fatigue, which earns the closing stance. Secondary figures (animals) add warmth, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive (seal the starlight to translate heartbeats into maps) is clear and enacted through patient, embodied choices under cold pressure. Interiority is particular—ache, breath, measured motions—but internal contradiction is modest (eagerness vs. discipline barely frays his control). The final understanding feels earned by tactility and prior failures, though the emotional cost on the page is light. Strong single‑POV calibration with credible competence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s “peripherally focused” approach drives his tactics (mirror, light angles) and his doubt about “reason’s cellar” adds a credible inner tension. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak. However, the emotional cost remains muted; he achieves the fix with little on‑page personal price beyond patience. The ending offers a modest repricing rather than a fully fraught renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s duty-driven precision and private hesitation around his mother’s locket create credible, embodied stakes. Micro-choices (re‑lighting the burner, recalibrating the flame, angling at the obsidian’s base) reveal values under pressure. The renunciation at his mother’s niche reads as an Earned Stasis with a felt cost. Interiority stays specific to his craft and history without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s motive—shaping grief through carving—is concrete and embodied in tactile choices (sharpening, the first tentative cut, placing the lion). Interiority is specific to her life with a lion tamer and the craft. The tension is mostly endurance rather than contradiction; she rarely wavers once she begins. A couple of thesis-like lines edge toward neatness but the choice she makes reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Veyra’s motives (clinging to fragments vs. the desire to let go) are concrete and embodied through tactile scavenging and the final renunciation. The ghost functions as a crucible for her self-accusation and fatigue, pushing a credible choice. The cost—dropping the camera wheel and surrendering her vigil, perhaps her life—reads on the page. One slip: the ghost’s line “Because you haven’t forgiven yourself” edges into diagnostic clarity, slightly flattening subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the scene. However, internal contradiction is limited; she meets little real resistance and experiences minimal destabilization. Embodied emotion lands in moments like her breath catching and the pendant’s clink. The final stance (a beginning rather than an end) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s contradiction—order-bound craftswoman drawn to wildness—reads clearly in embodied moments (ink-stained fingers, careful pendulum work versus stepping into the forecourt). Micro‑choices (touching the quartz, not fleeing the bear, nodding at the archway) credibly reveal a shifting hierarchy of values. The change (choosing an “and/and”: stay but listen differently) is earned if somewhat low-cost. Occasional abstract claims (“silence could be a kind of violence”) skim the surface of interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation—Elias hunts truth despite warnings—and small, legible choices (disembarking, entering, reading) align with that drive. Interiority is textured but leans on declared insight (“architecture of lies”) more than dramatized inner contradiction. The hinted self‑lie conflict isn’t tested on the page beyond a gentle willingness to confront darkness. Ending change is credible but low‑cost, registering as an internal reframe rather than a hard renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in specific history (grandfather’s rope, seed‑collector ethos), and Elias’s patient, tactile choices (coaxing the rope, aligning the glass) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is concrete and sensory rather than label‑only. The arrival of the cloaked woman tests his orientation but he adapts rather than wrestles with contradictory impulses. The final renunciation/reframing carries some cost, though the inner conflict remains gentle rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation (explaining absences, “obituaries for the living”) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (kneeling, not speaking, writing, following the thread) align. Interiority is textured through sensory attention rather than therapy-speak. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are muted; she rarely faces a live trade-off. The change at the end feels more like gentle repricing than a costed renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Corvin’s motive—to reawaken grown beauty—reads clear, embodied, and consistent, and his actions (assembling the device, focusing moonlight, reaching for the orb) align under pressure. Fear/hope contradictions surface credibly in the trembling, the whispered “No,” and tears. However, the change bears limited on‑page cost; his success arrives with minimal resistance or trade‑off. Elder Thalos’ late arrival affirms rather than pressurizes the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive—remaking a legacy of harm through care—drives concrete choices (lying about the coin, splinting, pressing for release). Interiority is embodied and particular (obsidian lagoon, sand “hissing”), and the father’s shadow is faced on‑page. The cost is mostly emotional and modest but real. Slight tidiness (she rarely falters) keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motive—defiant liberation of memories—drives clear, escalating micro-choices (collecting items, trusting a vision, prying the drain). The skeptic/imaginative paradox is dramatized, not merely labeled, with trembling hands and scraped fingers grounding emotion. Her endurance feels earned and the final stance—skepticism persists while accepting evidence—reads as credible. A slightly deeper cost or mistake under pressure could have sharpened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lumin’s desire to reconcile ancestral bans with a personal yearning for “a fire that whispers” is clear and compelling, with embodied beats (trembling hands, following the ping). The internal contradiction (ache for warmth vs. Enclave’s nonviolence) is dramatized rather than told. The micro-choices—following the sonar, questioning the ghost, placing the gear—align with motive. The cost is present but soft, largely implied social risk and relinquishing the gear rather than an on‑page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marlow’s motive (to face inherited grief) is clear and his actions—returning nightly, unrolling the ribbon, finally reading his poem—align with a credible inner shift. Interiority is embodied through trade-specific texture (gravestones, chisel-calloused hands) and the greenhouse’s sensory pressure. Contradictory impulses (silence vs. speaking) are present, though the cost is more implied than felt. The ending choice to carve “not by loss, but by love” reads earned, if a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and continuous—she must restart the pendulum to protect the village—and her occupational specificity grounds her choices. Interiority is textured (grandfather’s lesson, the ridge’s “pain”), but internal contradiction is mild; she rarely feels pulled in two directions beyond duty versus fear. Competence slightly flattens struggle, as the inscription provides a clean path once found. The felt cost (raw hands, drained focus) lands but is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to read the intentions of the dead—drives her choices and aligns with her occupational habits. Interiority is present but largely steady; there’s little simultaneous contradiction under pressure. The decision to rebury the case shows an earned stance, though the cost reads light. Embodied cues (calloused fingers, gentle handling) help, but deeper friction would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—using data plus intuition to force a thaw—is clear and consistent, with tactile embodiment (trembling hands, cramped fingers) and small costs (derision, fatigue). The fear/craving of the blank page gives a credible inner tension, though internal contradiction is otherwise light. Aphoristic self‑definitions (“Data without imagination is a corpse”) flatten nuance and edge into thesis‑speak. The end choice to burn journals reads as a meaningful renunciation but could carry sharper emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s motive—salvaging stories through pirate signals—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her copyist skill, which credibly shapes her tactic of decoding “via elusive song lyrics.” Embodied detail (pencil snagging, breath fogging the dial) roots her emotion without therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction is mild (zeal versus fatigue/solitude), so the felt cost sits more as endurance than clash. The Earned Stasis at the end (choosing ongoing, lonely work) reads earned but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motive—to crystallize a fleeting emotion while hiding behind the mask—is clear and consistent, and her actions (mask off, dedication, re‑masking, leaving the portrait unfinished) reveal a credible endurance/renunciation with cost. Interiority is specific (soot‑smudged hands, ash practice) and filtered through a character‑particular worldview. Elias’s brief pressure sharpens her stance without stealing focus. Minor limitation: the internal contradiction could tighten further under direct, situational strain.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession is clear and embodied (the cog as “trapped heartbeat,” bleeding hands), with a credible Earned Stasis at the end. The relationship crucible with Mara is effective—status jousting, skepticism vs. conviction—though his internal contradiction is limited (he barely wavers). Micro‑choices (refusing to sell, aligning needle and cog, continuing to dig) align with motive. The cost lands but his psyche reads more monolithic than torn.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s motive—saving vanishing arts by “subtracting noise”—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (urging Elias to play, humming counterpoint, inviting others). Interiority is textured if somewhat abstract at times; embodied moments (her breath catching, fingers on the rosette) help. The mentor-student dynamic carries warmth more than pressure, with little contradictory impulse on the page. Change is credible but modest, landing more as endurance than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive (to coax beauty from ruin) is clear and embodied in her tactile pruning choices under pressure. The memory floods create a credible push‑pull between trauma and gentleness that guides her tactics. Internal conflict is present but relatively safe—she meets resistance, yet the plant yields without a thornier moral cost. Still, the micro‑choices (which cuts to keep; rejecting violent lineages) feel specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s candid nature, weariness, and latent desire to rekindle awe yield credible choices (opening the box; deciding to “weaponize” truth). Interiority has specificity (“It tastes like regret,” “nectar dusk”) but leans explanatory at peak beats. Her internal contradiction (candor as burden vs. instrument) is present yet lightly tested. The social cost is stated more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular interiority (the “creeping normality noticer”) drives concrete choices—collecting and arranging displaced objects—revealing a distinctive mind. However, internal conflict is minimal; her certainty faces little friction. Embodied emotion lands in the hush “of attention,” but the arc lacks a palpable trade‑off. The final acceptance feels earned but cost‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive (grandmother/blight) is clear and her fear-to-resolve progression is credible, especially at the pedestal and when she chooses to drink. Lumen’s “incisively kind” guidance provides a distinct relational pressure without stealing POV. Internal contradiction is present but light—she drinks relatively quickly, with limited embodied hesitation beyond the “trembling” and breath hitch. A touch more visible cost or doubt at the sip would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s drive to “capture the texture of a missed opportunity” is specific and motivating, and his choices (hurling the smooth die, rupturing the step, then renouncing possession) align with that core flaw/longing. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (ozone and regret as an “addiction”). The moment he reaches for the dice then says “Let them be” gives a credible Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. It could show one sharper contradiction under pressure earlier to reach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s interiority is specific and embodied (smog as “burnt copper,” cataloging kindness), and her micro-choices under pressure (painting the eyes, relinquishing the brush, asking to be taught) align with her motives. The relationship with Mr. Voss functions as a crucible, revealing stakes and history without exposition bloat. The change—shifting from isolated doubt to committed apprenticeship—feels earned with a modest cost (time, patience, surrender of control). Slight tidiness in the self-articulation of the thematic insight trims the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motivation—reviving dying arts—is clear, embodied, and consistent, and her choices (host a festival, teach children, bake initials) align with it. The interior tension between “rosewater dread” and renewed purpose gives dimension but seldom sharpens into a hard trade-off. Interiority is particular (bread as vow; the lens as grief filter) and avoids therapy-speak. The final stance feels earned, though the cost is gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive is specific and embodied (pariah/prophet clockmaker obsessed with reversing fate), and his micro‑choices under pressure are clear (first attempt fails; he improvises the mercury coil). The contradictory affect—“triumph and terror,” later “bleak exhilaration”—adds lived texture. The grief/father thread charges his drive without stalling the scene. The cost to him personally is implied rather than concretely borne on the page, tempering the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s motive is clear and consistent—confront fear to uncover its weakness—and her micro-choices (standing still, welcoming the shadow, gripping the thread despite pain) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied (the clasp biting, copper‑tasting words). Vey functions as a pressure source with an ambiguous agenda, though he risks feeling schematic. The final exchange reframes their dynamic without neat reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leeward’s motive—transmuting chaos into harmony—is clear and her embodied effort (trembling hands, raw fingers, sweat, aching arms) reads specific. Micro‑choices (angle of mallet, shifting to the lightning‑scarred trunk, incorporating the seabird) reveal competence under pressure. Internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers emotionally beyond impatience and strain. The final endurance and small cost (faded mallet patterns, exhaustion) feel earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s motive matrix—grief, obsession, curiosity—drives clear micro‑choices (digging, whistle codes, flight, final defiance). Embodied perception (“air tasted of salt and iron,” trembling hands) grounds emotion without label‑speak. Internal contradiction is present but light (famine vs. answers); most beats read single‑goal driven. The final stance—standing with the journal as the city heaves—registers as earned endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s aim and expertise drive clear, motivated choices (examining the A, trusting Tomas enough to act, entering the tunnel). A small internal tension—scholarly skepticism vs. curiosity—surfaces when she weighs anecdotes yet follows the lead. The final decision to “finish the story” feels earned, though the emotional cost remains muted. Tomas reads distinct and steady, adding pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (survey erosion, secretly excavate abandoned dreams) is clear and consistent, and her stoic/sensitive contradiction surfaces in specific actions (placing flawed notes, gripping the inkwell, opening the hatch). Her emotional shift reads as a credible reconfiguration rather than a tidy epiphany. The cost is mostly internal and quiet, which limits peak intensity but fits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive (cataloging turned truth‑seeking) is clear and her micro‑choices—sketching grooves, aligning the stamp—reveal a methodical, calm mind under pressure. The ritual of stamping vs. the need to adapt creates a subtle internal tension that credibly resolves into purpose. Embodied perception (vibration in stone, algae slick on stairs) grounds her emotions. The final resolve tilts tidy, but it’s earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she crafts a lantern to hold her brother’s last words and to transmute grief. Interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, “brittle as winter ice” laugh) and actions align with motive. A credible endurance choice lands at the peak (“letting the pain wash over her”). Minor aphoristic lines flirt with neatness but remain earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-forged motivation is clear and consistent, and her defiance against Orion’s caution reads credibly under pressure. Embodied details (cracked glass underfoot, ozone and ash, the geode biting her palm) ground emotion. Internal contradiction is present but modest—she’s almost purely forward-thrusting rather than torn—so complexity is slightly limited. The final stance shift to “seer/disrupter” feels earned by choices and the visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s goal and competence are clear, and her micro‑choices (hooking the dome, hesitating, then pulling the lever) track with motive. Internal contradiction is light; “perpetually surprised” colors perception but rarely pressures action. The pilgrim provides credible pressure and guidance without stealing agency. Emotional embodiment is specific (hum in bones, chill in boots) though the cost of the final stance is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt and professional complicity are clear and embodied (the trembling watch, salt‑and‑secrets air). His contradictory impulses—comfort the client via lies vs. risk betrayal with truth—play on the page and culminate in a credible renunciation. Slight convenience in his instantaneous interpretive leaps from driftwood visions softens the struggle. Still, actions align with motives and the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clara’s interiority is textured and specific—arriving early to “untether,” holding the pull as a talisman, knowing the captives’ particulars—so her final renunciation reads earned. The contradictory impulse (carry vs. let go) is dramatized and unresolved in a credible way. Dialogue with Elias sharpens status and shared burden without tidy absolution. Minor limitation: her competence rarely strains against real-time pressure on the exchange itself.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s interiority is vivid and particular, with embodied contradictions (stubborn romanticism vs. fear of “growing up”) driving micro‑choices. Her decision to leave the compass behind is an earned renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost (relinquishing the heirloom and its false security). The Alzheimer’s‑shadowed grandfather thread deepens motive without becoming sentimentality. Emotional shifts layer credibly from dawn isolation to sunset resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (a reset spy seeking empathy) is clear and her micro‑choices—descending, wading, engaging J.T., then vowing a new tactic—track with that drive. Interiority shows contradiction (calculation vs. guilt) with embodied cues like the baseball under her thumb. The J.T. exchange occasionally states theme too directly, softening the messiness of her struggle. The final stance feels earned but carries limited on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—terror of losing humanity vs. compulsion to mend the bond—are embodied and specific, culminating in the choice to sing and accept the change. Her method and reactions (fragrance as language, the crack in her voice, the confession “I’m not ready”) feel character‑particular. The final shift reads earned by prior pressure from the phoenix’s presence and the animals’ offerings. The cost could register more sharply since she “did not fight it,” softening the felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s longing and guilt are specific, embodied, and drive concrete choices (laying cards, unfastening robe, climbing, placing The World). The internal contradiction—seeking “penance” for a sin she can’t name while yearning for contact—runs through the scene. The acceptance at the end feels earned by the preceding ritual labor and risk. Slight softness: the cost is mostly emotional and could be edged sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s pacifism and avoidance are clearly rooted and put under pressure, culminating in an earned pivot when she chooses to engage. Contradictory impulses (fear of monstrosity vs. duty to mend) are present in scene and inform the final act. The embodied quirk (lighter when happy) adds character texture, though most emotional turns lean conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. A touch of aphoristic articulation (“peace is not the absence of war...”) slightly blunts complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive (a destitute philanthropist chasing the “texture of transformation”) is clear and consistent, and her embodied responses (trembling hands, ankle‑deep grit) individualize her. The internal conflict—fixing vs. allowing messy change—registers credibly through the exchange with the collector and her final choice to listen. The cost is subtle (renouncing her habitual fixing impulse), which softens impact at this length. The scarred man provides pressure but functions mainly as expositor rather than testing her with a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivations are clear (Kieran’s fixation on the sundial and desire for a “silent revolution”), and actions track those aims. However, interior contradiction is minimal—Kieran rarely falters or pays a cost beyond caution—so pressure does not expose layered impulses. The relationship dynamic with Elara is competent but safe; she applies intellect, he provides the key. Emotional embodiment leans on labels (“his heart racing”) more than idiosyncratic sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motive (restore sacred order/answer her mother’s promise) is clear and sharpened by her precognitive burden. Micro‑choices under pressure—Fibonacci to Pascal’s triangle to Möbius—reveal a control impulse that she must renounce. Emotions are embodied (trembling hands, breath catching, “Not yet”). The closing acceptance reads earned, though one thesis‑like line skews toward told insight.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear interior drive (evade censorship, write truth) is embodied in tactile choices—lantern, mask, timer, opening the envelope, writing, sealing. Contradictory impulses register (“furiously tranquil”) without resolving too neatly. The final decision to mail the poem is earned by prior beats. Cost is mostly implied (Ministry risk), not felt on-page, tempering the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motives (to “recontextualize,” to duel-by-translation) and Elyra’s counter-stance (“travel” questions) are clear and embodied in action; the disarm/evolve beat earns a relational shift. Interiority is light but present (“Kael thought”), and the mechanical arm functions as character, not ornament. Contradictory impulses—competition vs. collaboration—surface credibly under pressure. Cost is modest (blood, yielding victory), but enough for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct interiority and embodied contradictions (trembling hands, the molting fugue vs. disciplined sorting) drive credible micro-choices: sharing the tin, writing “Blooming resistance.” The relationship with Marla reveals values without softening his edges. The epiphanic line “you must first become the anarchy” risks neatness but is earned via the found-poem device. Cost is felt as acceptance of instability rather than cured identity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motives (escape the crowd, evade “strategizing”) are specific and embodied, and her micro‑choices—rolling the film, prying the bench, descending, playing to ache—track cleanly. The “strategically creative” self‑bite shows live contradiction that resolves into a chosen stance. Cost is present though subtle: she forgoes fixing time/clock and embraces refuge with a felt ache and postponement. Strong, character‑particular interiority without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive and role are clear, and her micro‑choices (planting the seed, demanding to see the fracture, releasing the seed) align with rising pressure. The doubt beat provides credible internal conflict without stalling action. Some interiority leans abstract (“luminous doubt,” “test”) rather than embodied, softening felt cost. The final resolve feels earned but not deeply priced.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Yorick’s patience-driven craft and Lira’s urgent longing are clear, and their choices propel the action (accepting the lace method, going to sea, speaking apologies). Interiority is selective but specific (“find the color of what my father never said”) and embodied in tactile work. The relationship turn lands, though internal contradiction is lightly sketched and the reconciliation resolves tidily. Slightly more friction or hesitation under pressure would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with a strong, consistent internal voice filtered through her scientific specialty. Her motivation to find order in chaos is clear and compelling, and the internal conflict between her established identity and her new fascination is palpable. The final choice to present her unconventional findings is earned by prior beats, with the cost of professional alienation making her evolution meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s motivation to find purpose is clear and her background as a glass artist provides a credible, specific lens for her perceptions and actions. The shift in her artistic purpose is earned by the story’s events, particularly the discovery in the chamber. The characterization is strong, though the final epiphany feels slightly too perfectly articulated by the smuggler’s note, bordering on an external summary of her internal state rather than a purely internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lirael's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her traumatic backstory, driving every action on the page. Her internal state is well-embodied through her precise work and physical reactions. The relationship with Elias, though simple, provides a crucible for her to be seen, forcing a subtle but meaningful change in her isolation. The final earned stasis, accepting her new form of expression, feels both inevitable and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s transformation from a weary man clinging to the permanence of death to someone finding purpose is clear. However, his initial motivation to undertake the journey feels thin, driven by a dream rather than a compelling internal need, slightly weakening the causal chain. His stubbornness is stated more than it is dramatized as a consistent obstacle; he agrees to help Marisol relatively quickly. The goldfish dream is an effective, if late, anchor for his change.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and drives the plot, but its articulation feels overly tidy. The summary line, “Mira’s motivation had been simple: to bridge the gap...,” reads like a thematic statement rather than complex interiority, slightly flattening an otherwise strong character arc by removing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is clearly established and consistent, driving her actions throughout the narrative. However, her interiority occasionally relies on declarative statements ("now she sought to heal, not just document") rather than dramatized internal conflict. The character arc is more of a serene arrival at an answer than a struggle through contradictory impulses, which softens the impact of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistently drives the plot. The internal conflict is present as she pushes through the overwhelming visions. However, the final change in understanding feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on a diagnostic self-awareness that reduces the emotional complexity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot forward effectively. However, her interiority occasionally relies on stock phrases like "her mind racing," and her defining struggle as "chained" is resolved too conveniently. The final shift to "staggering grace" and snapping her chains feels more like a narrative requirement than an earned, embodied character moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is intensely clear and character-particular, rooted in her unique sensory perception and professional expertise. Her interiority is concrete, translating grief into a tangible, scientific quest. The final choice is earned by the preceding micro-decisions, and her reaction—"battered but marveling"—perfectly captures the contradictory emotional cost of her success, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's characterization is compelling and consistent, with her core competence balanced by the genuine hesitation at the climax. The climactic choice to offer her own memory is a powerful, earned turn that reveals a deeper layer to her motivations beyond simple thievery. This single moment of internal contradiction, where the thief becomes a giver, is excellently executed.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his internal landscape is well-realized, particularly the connection between glassblowing and his philosophy on imperfection. The backstory of his mentor’s death provides effective grounding for his present actions. However, some interiority feels overly articulate and diagnostic, such as when he narrates, “Its resistance mirrors the rigidity of those who fear change,” which reads more like an authorial thesis than an organic character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lila’s motivation and internal conflict are strong, and her final change is earned by the plot. However, the characterization is weakened by moments of diagnostic self-awareness, particularly in the dialogue. Lines like “You think vulnerability is weakness? It’s not. It’s a language,” while thematically relevant, read as authorial thesis rather than authentic speech for a character in a high-stakes emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation, rooted in her "mild obsession," is clear and consistently drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is beautifully specific, focused on the synesthetic experience of silence rather than generic emotional labels. The choice to accept the map's imperfection as the gold leaf sheds is a subtle but powerful micro-choice that demonstrates her values and resolves a potential internal conflict between perfection and creation, earning the final emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Unit-17's motivation is clear and consistent, and its defining trait ("remarkably composed") is well-demonstrated as it processes overwhelming temporal data without emotional overload. The internal state is conveyed through processor activity rather than embodied emotion, which is fitting for a robot. The final transformation is earned by the central experience, but the character lacks a deeper internal contradiction; the conflict is an external puzzle solved with internal logic, keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation, a curiosity born from a "resonant hush that masked something unresolved," is clear and compelling. His arc from meticulous archivist to translator of silence is well-executed. However, Lira functions more as an archetypal guide than a fully realized character, and her dialogue sometimes veers into thematic exposition ("honesty is the only currency left"), slightly flattening the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s characterization is strong and consistent; her motivation is clear and her actions are aligned with her established philosophy. Joren serves as an effective, if simple, foil whose conversion feels slightly too quick and frictionless for the highest echelon. While Elara's interiority is concrete, the dialogue exchange is more functional than revelatory, directly stating the thematic conflict rather than exploring it through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra’s professional motivation is clear and her competence is well-established. However, her internal journey feels slightly compressed; the shift from the terror of near-catastrophe to a renewed, smiling drive for discovery in the final paragraphs happens too quickly to feel deeply earned. The director's appearance serves the plot but he remains a stock 'enigmatic mentor' figure, limiting the scene's emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority occasionally relies on familiar phrasing like "a chill down her spine." The shift from needing to "prove the ghost's existence" to promising "I'll finish it" is a significant leap that feels slightly under-supported by the preceding internal conflict, making the final commitment feel more sudden than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling internal contradiction between her function as a logical oracle and her emergent, intuitive self. Her transformation is earned through concrete actions—tracing the illustration, pressing her hand to the glass, investigating the files. The final choice feels inevitable and true to the arc, with the cost of her old identity paid for the gain of a new, anchored self.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his defining contradiction—skepticism versus a hunger for the unknown—is well-established and tested. His final choice to leave the valve wheel represents an earned renunciation with a palpable cost, effectively closing his arc. However, some interiority, like his throat tightening or skepticism fraying, relies on familiar phrasing, slightly softening the impact of otherwise strong character work.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The keeper’s motivation is crystalline and compelling, and the final change is earned through the journey’s trials. The cost of this transformation—a loosening grip on reality—is made tangible and gives the resolution weight. The characterization is powerful, though the final internal state is described with slightly more summary than embodiment, which holds it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The characterization is clear but lacks depth. Elara serves as a gentle guide and feels more like a thematic device than a person with contradictory impulses, while Mara's shift from hardened skeptic to believer happens very quickly. The story states Elara is "softly adaptive" twice, a label that isn't meaningfully tested under pressure. Mara’s change, while central, feels more like a response to a magical event than a deeply earned internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. His interiority is conveyed through his focused actions and perceptions, fitting the quiet tone. However, his character lacks a significant internal conflict or contradiction; his journey is one of pure discovery rather than a struggle against a personal flaw or competing desire, which limits the character's depth and keeps the score from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation begins somewhat abstractly ("a need to transpose her own life into a new key"), but this is effectively crystallized into a concrete goal by the revelations in the safehouse. Her competence is well-established and her choice to continue her father's work feels earned within the story's compressed timeframe. The final image of her hands, "steady once more," provides a satisfying callback to the opening, showing her settled into her new, more dangerous purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The priest's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent. However, the character functions more as a vessel for the story's concept than as a person with embodied emotion or meaningful internal conflict. Interiority like "his mind raced" feels told rather than shown, and he proceeds with a competence that lacks the friction of genuine struggle or contradictory impulses, making the resolution feel more like an intellectual exercise than an earned emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "chronological homesickness." The interiority is lyrical and specific to her worldview, avoiding stock phrasing. However, the internal conflict between contradictory impulses feels more like a sustained state of being (melancholy vs. creative drive) than a dynamic, in-scene struggle, which slightly softens the impact of her final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara's motivation to conquer the "labyrinth of self" is clear and consistent. The internal conflict between the detached "gravity defier" and the woman wanting connection is established well, culminating in the choice to enter the labyrinth. However, the final resolution feels more stated than earned, relying on a somewhat diagnostic summary ("she saw herself as she truly was... a woman made of choices") rather than letting the final action carry the full weight of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lila's motivation is clear and her emotional arc is compelling. The character is well-realized through her specific sensory experience as a deaf music teacher. However, the introduction of her problem via a diagnostic label ("Emotional numbness, the doctors called it") and the slightly over-articulated final epiphany slightly weaken an otherwise strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes too quickly and is stated rather than earned. The shift from a meticulous, data-driven solitary to a risk-taking activist feels compressed, particularly the declarative line "His motivation crystallized: to document the unseen..." A stronger internal progression showing his data-driven mindset wrestling with intuition would have better justified the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between caution and need is well-dramatized. The character's core trait—aromatic caution—directly fuels the central choice. However, the epiphany in the final paragraphs feels over-articulated, shifting from embodied emotion to diagnostic self-awareness ("grief wasn’t something to be feared; it was a testament to love..."). This label-speak slightly undermines the earned quality of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, but his characterization relies on archetypes (drifting poet) and authorial labels. The line describing his laugh as "both ethically playful and tinged with desperation" tells rather than shows the internal contradiction. His final choice feels earned, but the specific interiority leading to it could be sharper and less summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the central action. Her interiority is well-established, particularly her restlessness and her opposition to the "wall" of silence. The character is slightly weakened by the final monologue, which feels more like a thematic declaration than an organic utterance, making her a direct mouthpiece for the story's message in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias Veyra is a well-defined and consistent character, but his core motivation and internal state are more declared than embodied. The direct statement, "He sought to fuse insight with empathy," functions as a thesis rather than an earned revelation, and he lacks a compelling internal contradiction during the on-page interaction. His competence is clear, but the "affectionate detachment" is not meaningfully tested, leaving the character feeling more like a perfectly executed concept than a person struggling with the costs of his philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s transformation from a shrewd, calculating broker to a facilitator of compassion is clear and motivated by the inciting incident. Her internal conflict is well-established, though the realization—"The cycles of compassion, she realized, weren’t grand gestures"—borders on diagnostic self-awareness rather than a purely embodied shift. The culminating action of forging the letter is a strong, character-defining choice that demonstrates her new values, but the interiority occasionally summarizes the theme too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, and his core emotion is well-embodied in the "luminescent ache." However, his characterization lacks deep internal conflict; his path is linear, and his reaction to the pivotal reveal is one of simple, immediate acceptance ("Kael laughed"). This tidiness at the climax prevents a higher score, as a more complex or contradictory internal response would have revealed more depth.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s motivation is clear, specific to her profession, and believably escalates from professional curiosity to existential awe. Her internal conflict between scientific skepticism and innate curiosity is shown through action, culminating in the decisive choice to use the pendant. The final change—from observer to one who understands and participates in the city’s magic—is earned by the climax, and the cost is the loss of her mundane worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and potent, rooted in a specific object and a well-defined personal history. Her interiority is concrete, especially the distinction of her loss as the "ambiguous, gnawing sort." However, the articulation of her brother's wisdom ("Emotion isn’t a straight line... It’s a mosaic") feels slightly too on-the-nose, serving more as a thematic signpost than as authentic, remembered dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but its transformation from survival to altruism feels slightly abrupt and overly articulated. The story relies on labels like “kindly nature” and “methodical mind” rather than consistently dramatizing these traits through contradictory choices under pressure. The final shift to "guardian" is earned by the plot, but the internal process is summarized ("Her motivation crystallized") rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between control and surrender is well-established. The change feels earned within the story's lyrical framework. However, her interiority and dialogue sometimes slip into diagnostic label-speak, particularly when she articulates the theme directly ("It’s… circuitously sincere. They don’t fight the transformation—they sustain it."), which reads more like an authorial thesis than an organic, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marin's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her artistic struggle and trauma. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly her initial state of haunted restlessness. However, her immediate, unquestioning acceptance of the stranger's supernatural proposition feels slightly unearned, softening the credibility of her core choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear—magnifying everyday magic—and her curiosity provides a credible reason for her pivotal choice. However, her internal conflict is brief and her decision to trust the pilgrim feels slightly under-dramatized given the immediate disruption to her sanctuary. The pilgrim functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully realized character, with dialogue that states the theme rather than revealing character through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. Interiority is summarized through labels like "reactively visionary" rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or visceral emotional responses to her discoveries. She functions more as a competent vehicle for the theme than a complex individual whose flaws or limits shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's internal conflict between meticulousness and artistry is well-established and creates a solid foundation for his motivation. However, the resolution feels externally granted rather than internally won. The mysterious woman functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a character, and her dialogue, "The fortress isn’t a destination... It’s a choice," explicitly states the theme, undercutting the nuance of Elias's internal struggle at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between skepticism and wonder drives the narrative effectively. The transformation is earned through the vicarious experience of Aelia's struggle. However, the emotional transfer is slightly summarized in the line "Aelia's courage seeped into her," which lessens the impact of what could have been a more deeply embodied moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation, shifting from immortal ennui to terrified hope, is exceptionally well-drawn for this length. The internal conflict is crystallized in a single, powerful image: the reflection of the "hollow" self who chose to stay. This grounds his final, high-stakes choice in a concrete, character-specific fear, making his turn from hesitation to action feel both sudden and inevitable. Lira serves her role effectively, though she is more of a catalyst than a fully developed character.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her key choices are clear, but her characterization leans into the prodigy trope without sufficient struggle. Once she tastes the ink, her competence becomes absolute, lacking the internal conflict or plausible missteps that would make her victory feel more earned. Her thoughts and dialogue read as overly sophisticated for her age, flattening the potential for a more authentic child's perspective under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Althea's motivation is clear and her interiority is specific. However, her characterization lacks a strong internal contradiction acting in-scene; she is presented as consistently dedicated, which slightly flattens the arc into an intensification rather than a complex choice. The final description of her "incandescent restraint" feels like an authorial label rather than an earned, embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his internal state is well-embodied through his unique perceptual filter. The arc from the scavenger "Kael Voss" to the purposeful "Marcus Hale" is earned by the climactic discovery. However, his special ability to see emotions as colors, while adding texture, doesn't manifest with a clear cost or limitation, making it feel more like a stylistic flourish than a deeply integrated character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s core contradiction as a logic-driven myth buster chasing an un-debunkable legend is established immediately and resolved with a satisfying, earned change. Her interiority is specific, particularly the coining of "gloomy cheerfulness," which feels authentic to the character. The final choice to hum rather than explain is a potent culmination of her internal arc, showing a cost in the forfeiture of her old worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is well-defined and her shift from mediator to organizer is compelling. Her internal conflict of "dual allegiance" is established but resolves into decisive action a bit too smoothly. The story would be even stronger if this contradiction created more friction or a visible mistake during her execution of the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in a compelling blend of professional duty and personal longing. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly in the tactile details of her actions under pressure. The character arc lands as a form of Earned Stasis, accepting obscurity for the sake of the act itself, which is a sophisticated choice for this length; however, the piece misses the opportunity for a more dynamic internal conflict, as her purpose remains quite singular and unchallenged from within.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's characterization is exceptional, with her blindness serving as a genuine lens for perception rather than a simple trait. Her motivation is clear and her competence is balanced with a quiet, humble interiority, shown through the humming of a lullaby. The relationship with Marlow is efficient and revealing, establishing her earned expertise and his respect for it. Her internal state is embodied through tactile interactions, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara’s characterization is exceptional for this length. Her motivation to find the *reasons* for rivers is clear and compelling, moving beyond simple exploration. Her core trait of being "subtly confident" is demonstrated from the opening gesture to her final smile, and her internal state is revealed when her "dry wit falter[s]." The contradictory impulses of intellectual rigor and acceptance of the impossible are handled seamlessly, culminating in an earned change of perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his established archetype as a patient mender. The final choice to depart, leaving the restored community behind, provides a poignant and earned cost that solidifies his character. However, his interiority remains somewhat static and archetypal, lacking the contradictory impulses or specific, personal texture that would elevate him to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—instinct versus patience—is effectively dramatized in the moment she considers smashing the vial. The final shift from wanting to “harness” to understanding the need to “release” constitutes an earned character change. While the memories the vial triggers are slightly generic (a mother's lullaby), they function well to establish the object's power without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to rewrite his father's legacy of lies is clear and compelling. The internal conflict is well-externalized through the ghost and the doppelgänger. However, the ghost's abrupt shift from antagonist ("It'll drown you") to proud observer at the end feels unearned, softening the impact of Elias's earned transformation by making reconciliation seem too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ghost bride’s motivation is compellingly complex, with the “loving and venomous” duality paid off in her final act. However, Elara is underdeveloped, functioning more as a plot device than a character; her primary motivation is a vague "curiosity and a growing sense of unease," which feels insufficient to trigger the story's climax. The ghost's interiority is told rather than shown through conflicting actions in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poetically rendered, driving all her actions. Her interiority is consistent, though it lacks a moment of significant internal contradiction or doubt that would deepen her "hauntingly optimistic" endurance. Her competence is well-established, but the struggle feels more physical ("fingers raw") than psychological, keeping her characterization just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael's characterization is strong and consistent. Her core internal conflict—skepticism versus an instinctual connection to the world's magic—is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The choice to "follow" is an earned culmination of her "purposeful but unhurried" engagement with the orchard, making her final acceptance of faith feel like a credible, character-driven change rather than a plot necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in the personal mystery of the first letter. Her actions are driven by her professional skills, and the final shift in motivation—from solving a personal puzzle to adopting a legacy—is earned by the climax. While her interiority is concrete, lines like "Lira’s breath hitched" and "Her motivation crystallized" verge on cliché and slightly undermine the otherwise strong embodiment of her focus and determination.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zara's characterization is strong, particularly the central trait of "disguising wisdom as foolishness," which is effectively dramatized through Jaxon's shift in perception. Her motivation is clear and consistent with her actions. While her interiority is present, some emotional moments rely on familiar gestures like "fingers trembled," slightly flattening the embodiment of her stress under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her internal change is earned through the story's central event. Her interiority is well-established, though it occasionally relies on direct summary ("She needed that healing..."). The characterization is strong, but a deeper exploration of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously within the main scene, rather than a linear process of discovery, would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by the specific and resonant interior concept of the “lotus-hearted ache.” Her motivation to bridge gaps is consistent and deepens compellingly from a professional duty into a personal, alchemical mission. The internal conflict between her disillusionment and her innate impulse to heal is dramatized effectively through her interaction with the coral and the cast, earning her final shift in perspective. The 9+ test is met as her choice to redefine translation is a direct result of her internal struggle, with the cost being a persistent but transformed emotional vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation to rediscover joy is clearly established and her emotional progression from quiet elegy to "stubborn, glorious joy" is earned through the events of the display. The shift is catalyzed effectively by Marla's recognition, which provides a concrete external validation. While the internal conflict is shown as a progression rather than a simultaneous contradiction in a peak moment, the final choice to create a "bigger, louder" mural demonstrates a decisive and costly renunciation of her former, safer isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marisol’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from a focused restorer to an embrace of restless curiosity is earned. The connection to her grandfather's "methodically playful" nature provides a strong emotional anchor at the end. Dr. Lysander functions effectively as a catalyst, though his dialogue sometimes veers into archetypal wisdom, slightly flattening his presence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot forward. However, his characterization as a "charming rogue scholar" feels more like an archetype than a deeply rendered individual, relying on labels like "ink-stained fingers" and stylized dialogue ("Candidly cryptic, as always"). The lack of significant internal conflict or contradiction keeps the characterization strong but prevents it from reaching exceptional depth; his path is goal-oriented without costly trade-offs that reveal a deeper hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” is established immediately and provides a powerful, consistent engine for her arc. The shift from using poetry as a “shield” to an “offering” is a subtle but profound change, earned through the story’s events. Her internal conflict is beautifully embodied in the physical world of the story, making her final, earned peace feel tangible and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her inherited vocation. Her internal conflict between the director's pragmatism and her own creative hope is well-dramatized. The final shift from "caretaker" to "collaborator" provides a satisfying arc for this length, earned by her actions. The characterization is strong, showing her competence and determination through precise, ritualistic movements.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and consistently drives the narrative. Her internal conflict is palpable, and the final choice to call her sister feels earned by the preceding intellectual and emotional labor. However, some characterization relies on telling rather than showing, such as the attribute "carefully reckless," which is stated but not fully dramatized in a way that creates a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's character is built on an intriguing contradiction between machinist precision and "slyly heartfelt" intuition, but this internal conflict is more stated than dramatized. Her motivation to solve the puzzle is clear and her actions are consistent. However, traits like "slyly heartfelt" are asserted as labels rather than emerging from contradictory impulses shown in the scene, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully embodied and complex under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear and compelling internal conflict between shame over his grandfather's legacy and a yearning for truth. Elias's transformation from a cautious man who "reinvents his personal history" to one who embraces his role as "a son" is earned and poignant. The contradictory impulses are evident in his simultaneous caution with clients and obsessive focus on the meteorite puzzle, and the final choice feels like a necessary culmination of his internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from investigator to creator is compelling and earned. Her interiority is rendered with particularity, especially in her connection to the wood grain. The father’s final lines ("Necessary distances...") verge on thematic summary, slightly flattening his character into a mouthpiece for the story's conclusion, which prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her final realization feels more like a tidy, articulated summary than an embodied, contradictory internal state. The phrase "belonging was not about fitting into a preconceived mold" is diagnostic label-speak that abstracts the emotion at a peak moment. While her actions are motivated, the interiority smooths over the complexity of the experience by stating the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, and the "cheerful gloom" provides a memorable internal contradiction. However, the final emotional shift feels more intellectual than embodied; the transition from her methodical investigation to the profound acceptance of painful loss is slightly abrupt. The core change is earned conceptually, but the character's internal experience of that change could be more deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her characterization serves the concept more than it reveals a complex individual. Interiority often reads like a thesis statement (e.g., "orchestrate serendipity by ordering randomness"), and the absence of any real internal conflict or self-doubt makes her feel more like a flawless executor of an idea than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s motivation is crystalline and deeply embodied; the ache for renewal is not just stated but felt in her actions. The internal conflict between fledging and anchoring provides a compelling contradiction that drives the entire performance. The final choice is an act of earned endurance, fully supported by the preceding characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is well-rendered through her professional lens as a glazier. However, the emotional progression feels slightly too articulated, culminating in an epiphany that is described more than it is embodied. The moment of feeling a "connection to something larger than herself" verges on stock phrasing, slightly flattening an otherwise specific character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation to resolve his past is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between guilt and professional competence is well-established. The backstory of his mother and the fire provides a solid foundation. However, the final shift to enlightenment feels slightly accelerated, relying on a moment of insight rather than a more deeply dramatized internal struggle in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization as a "logical dreamer" is established immediately and consistently demonstrated through her methodical actions and precise interiority. Her motivation is clear and compellingly abstract, grounded by the tactile experiment. The micro-choice to add a thread of her own hair provides a personal, embodied stake that feels earned and effectively triggers the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her arc from investigator to inheritor is earned. The final choice to burn the negative is a powerful, character-defining act that pays off her internal journey. While her concluding epiphany—"the dreams were not separate from her own"—verges on being slightly too articulated, her tangible actions ground it effectively, showing a complex internal state resolving into a decisive, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivation is clear, potent, and rooted in the concrete object of the locket. Her interiority is well-rendered through her focus on her sister's memory. The attribute "perceptively calm" feels slightly asserted rather than fully dramatized against the clear physical strain, a minor tell in an otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence is well-established. Her interiority, however, occasionally slips from specific, embodied thought into abstract thematic statements like "the price of redemption," which reads more like authorial summary than a character's immediate internal conflict. This tendency to label her own struggle slightly flattens the characterization, preventing it from reaching exceptional heights.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    The character's central contradiction—amoral destruction paired with secret sentimentality—is not just stated but embodied in every choice. The motivation to preserve an "echo" is a sophisticated and compelling driver for the narrative. The final act of renunciation (not checking on the egg) feels earned and powerfully defines his twisted hierarchy of values, where the ritual matters more than the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s motivation to defy conformity is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract poetics ("each step a sonnet") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses during the main action. The characterization is weakened by a single jarring line—"her dance a middle finger to the world’s expectations"—which breaks from the established voice and reads as a diagnostic label rather than an in-the-moment thought, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is well-established and consistent, stemming from specific guilt over the tycoon's eulogy. His actions directly serve this motivation. However, his core internal conflict is largely delivered via a backstory paragraph rather than being fully dramatized in the present scene, and his key attribute of "serenity" feels more like a label than a quality tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—the meticulous knotting—embody her philosophy well. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "esoteric realist" and "transiently rooted existence," which read more like authorial summary than a character's specific, in-the-moment thoughts. This tendency toward self-diagnosis slightly flattens the voice and prevents the characterization from reaching exceptional levels of embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and poignant, rooted effectively in his grief and past trauma as a caster. The interiority is generally strong, connecting his scarred hands to his present, delicate task. However, the characterization is slightly flattened by a lack of internal contradiction in the moment; his sorrow and determination proceed on a single, unwavering track rather than wrestling with each other during the difficult weaving process.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s character is consistent and her motivation is clear. The central contradiction between foresight and hindsight is well-established and paid off. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness (“she saw them as twin lenses”), which lessens the impact of an otherwise earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a compelling blend of professional curiosity and personal history with her mentor. Her core trait of frugality is effectively tied to her worldview, though the direct link to intuition feels more asserted than demonstrated. The climax, where she accepts an internal covenant, represents an earned character shift, resolving the central conflict between her empirical skepticism and her metaphysical quest with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael's motivation is exceptionally clear, but her characterization as a "scheming pacifist" is not earned; her methods are direct and didactic, not cunning. The internal conflict is articulated rather than embodied, with visitors serving as thematic archetypes instead of fully realized characters. Kael presents the most credible opposition, but the resolution relies on a gentle persuasion that feels more like a fable's lesson than a complex character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist, Elias, serves more as a skilled facilitator than a character with a compelling internal arc. His motivation to help is immediate and lacks the friction suggested by his "firmly grounded" nature, which is stated but not dramatized. The story's emotional weight and cost are borne entirely by the stranger, leaving the POV character's transformation feeling intellectual rather than earned through personal risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, anchored effectively by the hair ribbon and the memory of her daughter. Her interiority is concrete, though it occasionally strays into self-summary. The character is compellingly stubborn, but the final beats of the story articulate her earned wisdom a bit too neatly, trading embodied realization for a slightly diagnostic summary of her own growth.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation—an obsessive hunger for understanding—is clear and effectively drives the plot. The internal conflict is articulated as "simply complicated," and while her decisive actions contrast nicely with this, the trait itself feels more stated than dramatized. Her final choice to accept the inheritance is a credible culmination of her established curiosity, earning its emotional weight within the story’s brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her character arc—from priding knowledge to embracing ignorance—is well-executed and earned by the climax. The change is compelling. However, her core trait of being "carefully resourceful" is stated more than it is dramatized as a constraint in the final confrontation, and the last paragraph slightly over-summarizes her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her dynamic with the skeptical Veyra creates a compelling internal/external conflict. Veyra’s shift from cynicism (“Your ‘garden’ is a myth”) to acceptance is earned through the events of the story. The characters' unique physical and psychological bond is well-realized, making their final shared moment of peace feel both earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is established and fulfilled, but her internal change feels more like a discovery than an earned transformation. Her competence is asserted ("warmly methodical," "deftly untangling") and demonstrated, but she faces little internal friction or contradictory impulse. The final epiphany, "she was a weaver of timelines," is delivered to her by the scroll, making it feel less like a character-driven choice and more like a promotion, which slightly cheapens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her struggle is effectively embodied through physical sensations like her aching ribs and teeth. The shift in her understanding—from seeking absolute silence to finding “the quiet within” the noise—represents a credible, earned change for a character defined by harmony. While internal conflict is primarily shown as endurance against external pressure rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses, the characterization is focused and effective for the story’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is consistently dramatized through her actions, particularly the physical cost of her hope ("fingers bled"). Her interiority is concrete and her final choice is earned. The characterization is slightly weakened by a moment of convenient realization ("*They knew*") that feels more like an authorial shortcut than an earned insight derived from the immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between archiving and participating is well-drawn. The arc from "clinging to the echoes of what was" to letting experience shape her is earned. However, the final change is articulated with a self-awareness that verges on diagnostic, slightly softening the emotional impact of her embodied experience just moments before.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific past failure. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through concrete actions like her chanting and her sensory filtering, avoiding abstract labels. The final change is earned by her deliberate choices, fulfilling her mentor’s teachings with a visible cost—a "raw and unfamiliar" laugh that signals a true transformation, not just a success.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-embodied through her retreat to the grotto. Her character is revealed through her actions and perceptions, especially her choice to use the cicada. However, her final lines to Kael, particularly the “fermented, like seaweed” metaphor, veer close to diagnostic label-speak, slightly over-articulating the theme rather than letting the moment rest in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and poetic, but the final change feels more like an intellectual summary than an earned emotional shift. The line, “She’d learned that by limiting her exposure... she could sprout new ways of being,” is a diagnostic label that flattens the interiority, summarizing the arc instead of letting the character live it in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, her internal conflict is presented as a persistent problem rather than contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The final epiphany, while fitting, feels more like a sudden gift of insight than a resolution earned through a tangible, on-page struggle with her own flawed assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her key actions align with the stated "wisely adventurous" trait, especially the choice to question the guardian. However, her interiority feels somewhat generic, relying on declarative statements like “Fear was a luxury she couldn’t afford” rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The characterization is highly functional and consistent but lacks the deep specificity needed for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-established, driving the central action. However, her key line of dialogue, “I need to teach suffocating to breathe,” reads as overly-articulated, diagnostic self-awareness. This moment of high emotional vulnerability is undercut by a line that feels more like a thematic statement from the narrator than a character's authentic utterance, slightly weakening an otherwise strong character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is expertly established through her backstory as a “pyramid scheme survivor,” which credibly fuels her distrust of authority and her “virtuously mischievous” willingness to defy Voss. The internal conflict between following orders and trusting the mysterious device is clear and culminates in a choice that feels earned. Voss is a functional, if slightly archetypal, pressure-source, but Mara’s interiority is specific and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. The internal journey from seeking a dark secret to understanding a legacy of sacrifice provides a solid, if compact, arc. However, the final resolve—"she would honor their choice by building something new"—feels slightly too swift and summarized, transitioning from a profound emotional discovery to a rational plan without a moment of embodied struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cedric’s motivation is clear and his internal journey from silent trauma to euphoric release is coherent. The transition is anchored in his interaction with the story's magical objects. However, the initial motivation to "capture" the greenhouse feels slightly abrupt, and the final laugh, while cathartic, comes on very quickly for a character established as having not spoken since a major battle.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully established, rooted in his own history of being unwanted post-emancipation, which gives his search for meaning in others' forgotten lives a palpable weight. The internal conflict between his broken-hearted past and a "tactfully hopeful" present is dramatized effectively through his meticulous actions. The final choice to create a new history is a perfectly earned culmination of his internal journey, demonstrating a meaningful change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her established traits of being resourceful and underestimated. The characterization is effective and drives the plot. However, for the highest tier, a moment of genuine internal conflict—a flicker of doubt or a difficult trade-off between competing values felt in-scene—would elevate her beyond pure, unflinching competence.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is specific, deeply rooted in backstory, and embodied through his actions. The choice to fight the prophecy not with sound but with "negative space" is a superb, character-defining tactic. His internal state is rendered with concrete physical details ("restless heart," "lungs burning") rather than abstract labels, and the progression from mournful playing to a "frantic staccato" under pressure is earned and compelling. The final shift to "strange peace" feels like a credible, hard-won exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elinor’s characterization is exceptional, transitioning credibly from a meticulous, reverent observer to an agent of prophecy. Her motivation is sharp and her actions, particularly the precise and delicate building of monuments, align perfectly with her established role. The internal change from quiet knowing to active purpose is earned and embodied in the phrase "mossy delight," a character-particular emotional note that avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation as a seeker of order is well-established and consistent. His internal conflict between imposing certainty and facing chaos is dramatized effectively through his actions. The final change is earned by the story's climax, but slightly weakened by the overly articulate self-analysis in his journal entry, which reads more like a thematic summary than an organic character moment.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between logic and mysticism is well-established, driving the central action. His emotional state is embodied in the setting and his memories. However, Lira’s dialogue feels less like an individual character and more like a thematic mouthpiece, particularly the line, “balance isn’t about equal parts,” which reads as diagnostic summary rather than authentic speech, slightly flattening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent. Her interiority is well-drawn, particularly the central conflict between her quest for joy and her admission of fear ("I fear that laughter is not enough"). The final change is earned through her direct engagement with the spirit, but the characterization is slightly weakened by abstract descriptors like "modestly fearless" rather than letting the trait emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and powerfully embodied, with his trauma shaping his perception and choices. The primary weakness is the dialogue from the woman (“Mercy isn’t a equation. It’s a choice”), which veers into thematic summary, slightly undercutting the earned nature of his final internal shift by stating the lesson too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, but her internal arc feels more stated than earned. The final paragraphs shift from embodied experience into an over-articulated summary of the story’s theme, which reads like an unearned epiphany. While her actions are consistent, the character's change is delivered as a neat lesson rather than a complex, costly internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his defining trait ("skillfully observant") is demonstrated through action. His interiority is conveyed effectively through phrases like "weightless burden." The final change in his mission is earned, but the characterization stops just short of the highest tier because the fundamental "why" of his connection to ghosts is presented as a given, rather than explored through a deeper internal conflict or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, serving as an effective catalyst for the story's events. However, her characterization operates more on an archetypal level than a psychological one. While her resolve is evident in her final smile, the story doesn't dramatize any internal conflict or personal cost for her choices, which keeps the portrayal from achieving exceptional depth; she is a function of the plot, impeccably executed, but not a fully textured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is intensely clear and consistent, rooted in his past as a revolutionary. The transition from direct action to a more subtle, "poetic" rebellion is well-realized. His interiority is conveyed through strong, specific images ("sharp as regret," "burned like a slow fuse") rather than abstract labels. The final choice to reveal the fungi demonstrates a brilliant blend of foresight and desperation, a choice fully earned by the established character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation and emotional arc are compelling and earned, forming a strong core. Elias, however, functions more as a wise archetype and catalyst than a fully drawn character, with his interiority primarily serving to explain the world's mechanics. While efficient for this length, this dynamic slightly flattens his characterization, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her specific obsession. Her actions align with her "sensibly eccentric" nature. The final shift from seeking understanding to accepting mystery is a valid character change, though her internal articulation of it ("You were looking for the place where explanations fail") verges on overly-diagnostic self-awareness, slightly undermining the earned feel of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation, "to scaffold complexity with simplicity," reads as an abstract thesis rather than an embodied goal, making her actions feel intellectually driven rather than personally necessary. Her "perpetually learning brain" serves as a label that conveniently bypasses the struggle of discovery, leading to an unearned epiphany. The character arc is a passive reception of knowledge rather than an active, costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted effectively in her grandmother’s legacy. Her interiority is conveyed with concrete, embodied language ("restless energy that coiled in her chest"). The transformation from seeking a final answer to embracing an ongoing "reckoning" is well-earned, but the characterization lacks a moment of sharp, simultaneous internal contradiction in-scene, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling through the rising action, rooted in her archivist nature and the personal cost of her gift. However, the final choice to destroy the codex and her subsequent line, "The truth's out there now," feels inadequately justified. This action reads as a contradiction to her established drive to preserve and uncover, creating an unearned reversal in character logic at the story's most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear but his shift from hollow to fiercely driven feels abrupt. His interiority is often stated with labels ("He rejected false comfort") rather than consistently embodied, and his successful endeavor lacks the sense of struggle that would make his final catharsis feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voss's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from investigation to acceptance. The interiority is specific, particularly his connection to the garden and the memory. The final shift from passive archivist to active witness feels earned by the story's internal logic, representing a credible change with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, culminating in an earned emotional beat. However, her core trait, “furiously tranquil,” is presented as a diagnostic label rather than being fully dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure, slightly flattening the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's characterization is clear and her motivation to perform her duty well drives the plot effectively. Her transition from a humble tester to a "maestro" is earned through her on-page choices, particularly the experiment with the secondary rope. While her core traits are well-demonstrated, the narration sometimes defaults to labeling them (e.g., "her credibly curious nature"), which slightly lessens the impact of her otherwise well-embodied actions.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes uses abstract, diagnostic language ("a heart that had learned to hold both grief and wonder in equal measure") rather than showing contradictory impulses in the moment. Veyra functions more as a thematic counterpoint than a fully realized character, making his final, subtle shift feel slightly convenient. The characterization is strong but stops short of exceptional due to these elements of telling over showing in the internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, and his final reversal is impactful. However, his interiority is often summarized ("grown tranquilly perceptive") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the scene. The critical shift from preserving silence to speaking is prompted by a direct, external command from the box, which slightly lessens the sense that the change is fully earned from internal struggle alone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his past as a banker and his grief. The final choice to leave the urn fragment is a well-earned renunciation, showing a credible change. However, his interiority sometimes leans on direct conceptual statements like "Timelessness, he realized..." rather than maintaining a purely embodied, experiential perspective during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her poetic sensibility. Her interiority is specific, but occasionally veers into direct thematic statement rather than embodied experience (e.g., "To discover beauty in the incomplete, she believed..."). Her actions, however, are perfectly aligned with her motives, and the final shift to accepting transience feels earned through the process of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her defining traits (“gentle and systematic,” “brazen calm”) are demonstrated through action. Her interiority is concrete, though her self-awareness feels almost too complete, lacking a deeper internal contradiction in the moment of crisis. The dialogue with the spirit, particularly her line, “This is a bridge,” borders on thematic summary rather than a raw, in-the-moment response, slightly flattening the peak emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lirael’s characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction between her “luminous skepticism” and her “obsession” is dramatized effectively, not just stated. Her final laugh, “a sound like breaking glass,” is a perfect piece of embodied emotion, conveying the shattering of her intellectual framework with a tangible cost—the ache of longing. Kael is an excellent foil, applying precise pressure that complicates Lirael's binary view of truth vs. fraud.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman’s characterization is compelling and internally consistent. His motivation, born from a soldier's past and a desire for redemptive creation, is vividly established through reflective fragments that anchor in present action. The internal conflict between wielding swords and seeds is elegantly shown, and the final, rare smile represents an earned emotional shift, fulfilling the 9+ quick test of a choice with visible cost (the emotional opening after long stoicism).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    Hush's motivation "to translate distance into closeness" is an abstract, authorial assertion that feels disconnected from a canine perspective. While her actions are consistent, her internal life reads as a human's projected onto a dog, lacking embodied, contradictory impulses. The story substitutes a high-concept ability ("intuitively descriptive") for earned character depth, making her less a character and more a gentle, fantastical plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elio’s motivation and internal conflict are rendered with specificity, particularly his need to find order in chaos. The character arc is clear and compelling, culminating in a meaningful change from analytical hesitation to intuitive action. The final epiphany is slightly over-articulated in prose, pulling back from a purely embodied resolution, but the shift is earned through the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear, but his characterization lacks depth. Interiority is functional ("heart pounding") but relies on summary rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The final paragraph's self-assessment—"He was no longer just a thief. He was a guardian of wonder"—is an unearned, diagnostic label that tells the reader about his change instead of dramatizing it, weakening the story's emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her unique backstory as a crisis survivor turned crisis actor. The internal conflict between performed grief and authentic memory is elegantly embodied in her actions. The final realization is earned by her sustained ritual, making the shift from observer to actor (the pawn) a powerful and credible character change with a felt cost in her aching scars.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael's motivation—to find the "shape of home"—is clear and compelling, driving a credible choice to confront a known source of pain. Her internal conflict is well-established through her avoidance of the stone and the nightly torment of borrowed memories. The final earned change is visible and embodied, foreclosing her previous passive stance with the physical cost of the embedded shards.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Alaric’s motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and well-grounded in the chess-related backstory. The internal conflict is present, but the final epiphany feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied. The realization that "the kingdom’s corruption had been woven into the very fabric of the court" reads more like a diagnostic conclusion than a raw, earned insight in a moment of crisis, slightly flattening the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, but the final epiphany ("The price of forgiveness, he realized…") feels overly articulate and diagnostic, like a conclusion reached after the crisis, not a raw realization during it. This slightly undermines the otherwise strong interiority by summarizing the theme instead of embodying the change.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s arc from “uncertain alchemist” to self-acceptance is clear and compelling. Her internal conflict is well-embodied, particularly in the contrast between her trembling hands and her decisive final actions. The statue’s dialogue functions as a sharp externalization of her self-doubt, but her final realizations, while earned, are articulated with a diagnostic clarity (“Kintsugi... isn’t about perfection. It’s about *surviving*.”) that slightly lessens the emotional impact of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his painter's perspective offers a consistent filter for the world. The internal conflict between his promise and his need for solace drives the narrative effectively. However, the resolution suffers from a moment of over-articulated self-awareness ("He’d kept his hidden promise to himself: to find beauty in the fractures..."), which reads like a diagnostic label rather than an earned, embodied state of being, slightly cheapening the final emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her backstory, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The internal conflict between her "mad urge" and her methodical practice is well-drawn, and her unspoken words add a layer of potent vulnerability. Thalos serves as an excellent catalyst, subverting the expected antagonistic role to become a mentor, which deepens Elara’s character arc from a solitary trial to a validated practice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, driving every action. Her interiority is conveyed through focused, determined action rather than reflective summary, which suits the story's momentum. The characterization is slightly archetypal, showing immense competence and resilience with little internal contradiction or flaw, which prevents it from reaching the highest tier of complexity but serves the mythic tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her rational-yet-empathetic nature creates a compelling core. However, her final resolve feels more like a thematic pronouncement than a personally costly choice. The line, “safety isn’t just a feeling—it’s a choice,” reads as an authorial thesis, slightly flattening the character’s internal experience at the story’s peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is well-established, linking his professional obsession with borrowed memories to his personal loss. His final choice is a potent culmination of this, but the woman feels more like a thematic device than a character with internal contradictions. The line "I've carried enough" lands with force, providing a strong, earned anchor for his change.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-established, moving from stagnant loneliness to a renewed sense of purpose. The vision of her father provides a strong emotional anchor, and her ultimate change feels earned through that confrontation. However, the final paragraph relies slightly more on summarizing her new state ("cartographer of her own heart") than on a purely embodied emotional experience, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's motivation is clear, but the story's climax relies on the entity delivering a diagnosis of her psychology. The dialogue, particularly lines like "You feel the weight of crowns, the ache of loneliness, the fear of irrelevance," is a form of diagnostic label-speak that summarizes her internal conflict rather than allowing her to discover it through a more embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from obsessive persistence to receptive insight is well-executed. Jorin functions effectively as a catalyst, and their dynamic adds depth. The character-specific blend of “awe and precision” is demonstrated, though the epiphany hinges on a conceptual leap that feels more asserted than logically derived from her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is sharp and compelling, driven by the specific, embodied feeling of "feral nostalgia." The motivation to understand his fragmented self is clear and consistent. However, the final interior monologue feels slightly too self-aware and diagnostic, particularly the articulation of jealousy towards "other Eliases," which could have been shown more through action or memory fragments rather than such a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s characterization is strong and coherent, with a well-established internal conflict rooted in her sensory loss. Her motivation to interpret objects is a direct, credible consequence of her past, making her micro-choices (examining the screw, cross-referencing the file) feel earned. The final emotional shift to a 'light' chest is justified by the successful application of her unique skills, resulting in a satisfying, earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation to transform his past failures is clear and embodied in his trembling hands and itching scars. The internal conflict between his scholarly training and youthful superstition feels authentic, compelling his climactic choice. The final shift from a scholar chasing answers to a storyteller embracing questions is earned, though the character's final self-awareness is articulated with a touch too much diagnostic clarity for a moment of raw transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clara’s character is compelling, with a unique profession that sets a strong initial tone. Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in powerful guilt. However, Clara’s internal contradictions feel underdeveloped; her pivot from cynical exorcist to empathetic facilitator happens too smoothly, and the line "Imperfect miracles require imperfect methods" feels more like an authorial thesis than an organic utterance from this specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The Witness is more of an archetype than a character, a vessel for the story's theme. Motivation is clearly stated ("to unravel cosmic illusions") but remains abstract, lacking the friction of specific, contradictory impulses shown in-scene. The epiphany feels asserted rather than earned through a dramatized internal struggle; the shift from confusion to peace is abrupt and lacks embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lorn's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, moving beyond a generic curiosity into a tangible, ritualistic quest. The interiority is concrete, rooted in sensory details and the inherited wisdom/mystery of his grandfather. The final change is an internal acceptance of a new, sharper reality, which is earned by the preceding ritual and feels like a costly but necessary shift in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation hinges on a “private obsession: the physics of surrender,” an overly convenient trait introduced via telling rather than showing. This makes his pivotal insight feel less earned and more pre-ordained. While his arc from analysis to trust is clear, the internal conflict is articulated with diagnostic labels instead of being dramatized through contradictory actions or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara's motivation, a blend of grief and intellectual curiosity inherited from her father, is rendered with concrete specificity. The internal conflict between her "compulsive gambler" impulse and his theoretical world is not just stated but dramatized in her choice to follow the cryptic clues. The final emotional release feels earned, a direct result of the preceding surreal trial, fulfilling the 9+ test of contradictory impulses leading to a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but articulated through abstract, diagnostic labels like “Cultivated estrangement” and “teach endings how to begin.” This intellectual framing distances the reader from her inner life, making her feel more like a vehicle for a concept than a person with embodied, contradictory impulses. Her final realization that the disc is a mirror is an unearned epiphany, stated rather than arrived at through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for a solitary piece. Elara's interiority is rendered with concrete, specific detail, particularly the central conflict between the hollowness of legend and the photo's humanity. The final change—a quiet acceptance of her role—is earned by the preceding contemplative beats, with the cost being the perpetual, moment-to-moment weight of her task. The concept of "haunted euphoria" is not just stated but successfully embodied in the story's mood and her perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a believable world-weariness. The internal conflict is present, particularly in the shift from a "desperate, jocular bark" to a grin that is a "bridge," showing earned change. Lira is a sharp, effective foil, though her characterization relies more on archetype. The protagonist's final shift is slightly rapid but acceptable for this length, feeling earned through the story's conceptual weight rather than deep psychological turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his defining trait (blindness) and goal. The interiority is well-embodied through his tactile relationship with the world. However, the character's final arc tips toward an unearned epiphany, with the mother's final line acting as a diagnostic label for his journey ("the place where feeling becomes seeing") rather than a fully earned, embodied realization from his own perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is sharp and compelling, rooted in specific guilt. His internal conflict between practiced confidence and newfound failure is palpable. The character arc from arrogant "fixer" to humble "witness" is well-executed for this length, though the final transformation feels slightly accelerated. Lira functions effectively as a catalyst, though she borders on being a mouthpiece for the theme rather than a fully independent character.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal state is sometimes over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic summary (e.g., “to translate silence into music”). The characterization is effective but lacks the deep, contradictory impulses expected at the highest level. Lira serves her role as a catalyst well, but her shift from skepticism to collaboration is very swift. The final moment of sadness adds a welcome layer of complexity to Kael's otherwise singular drive.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and potent, anchored effectively in the promise to her grandmother. The internal conflict is well-realized, culminating in the earned shift from “arsonist” to “gardener.” However, the “arsonist” label feels slightly discordant with the on-page actions, which are centered on ink and acid rather than fire, leaving the central metaphor of “fires as translation” as a promising but undramatized assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s motivation to understand his borrowed sorrow is clear and his defining trait—quiet rebellion through drumming—is well-established and pays off. The internal conflict between prescribed stillness and defiant action is effective. However, the final shift in motivation relies heavily on the other character’s direct explanation, making the epiphany feel slightly less earned than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to prove his theory—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. His interiority is conveyed through concrete actions and sensory details, such as the coin burning in his palm, rather than abstract labels. The character’s core contradiction, a meticulous map-follower who must learn to trust instinct, is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice that earns his final change in status.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lira's character is consistent, but her motivation ("to teach darkness the value of stars") and attribute ("spiralingly calm") are stated as abstract labels rather than demonstrated through embodied contradiction or choice under pressure. Her actions align with these labels, but the lack of internal conflict or a difficult micro-choice makes her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a complex individual. The characterization is functional but lacks the depth of a truly earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with clear, consistent motivations for both Clara and Lila. The device of "unspoken words" effectively externalizes Lila's internal journey from isolation to connection. The only minor weakness is that Lila's final lines ("You're planting forests... with me") verge on articulating the theme too directly, slightly flattening the subtext at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation to escape is clear and compelling. The internal conflict between skepticism and desperate hope is established but resolves too quickly into a serene epiphany. The moment of understanding ("She understood now: the island hadn’t been a prison but a mirror...") feels more like a diagnostic summary of the theme than an embodied, contradictory emotional experience, slightly undercutting the earnedness of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael's characterization is strong and her motivation is clear, rooted in grief and defiance. Her interiority is effectively shown through the ritualized action of carving. However, the final whispered line, “Lightness is not the absence of darkness. It’s the courage to carry both,” functions as a diagnostic summary of her emotional state, a Thematic Echo that slightly undermines the embodied struggle shown throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her aesthetic drive to dissolve boundaries. Her interiority is specific to her poetic nature, and her actions align perfectly with her stated goals. The progression from seeking beauty to actively reshaping reality is earned. The characterization is strong, though her emotional state reads more as a conceptual certainty than a deeply embodied feeling, which slightly distances the reader from the core experience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the narrative from the first paragraph to the last. Marla serves as an effective catalyst, though her dialogue occasionally slips into overly direct thematic pronouncements. The description of Elias as "innocently cunning" is asserted but not clearly demonstrated in his actions, which read more as artistic curiosity than strategic guile.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, her primary attribute, "powerfully gentle," is repeatedly stated as a label rather than demonstrated through a choice with a tangible trade-off. The characterization is strong but leans on assertion for its core traits, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of showing character through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation for atonement is clear and consistently drives his ritualistic actions. The internal conflict between his private grief and his desire to mend the world is well-established. While the emotional arc is earned, some moments of interiority read as slightly over-articulated summaries ("his heart full of a quiet, burning certainty") rather than embodied feeling, which holds it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted effectively in her backstory as a data analyst. However, her articulation of her own methods and insights, particularly in dialogue with Mara, verges on diagnostic label-speak ("I reverse engineer chaos by measuring its echoes"). This over-clarity undermines the sense of a character discovering or practicing a mysterious art, making her feel more like a narrator explaining the story's thesis than a person in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict is effectively embodied in her physical reactions versus her steady voice. Kael functions well as a foil, externalizing the central philosophical conflict, though he borders on being a one-dimensional representation of fear. Lirael’s final acceptance of her path is earned, but some of her self-articulation, like "the anguished joy of the unknown," feels slightly too self-aware and less like an in-the-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her core trait of being “softly deliberate” is well-dramatized in her choice to investigate alone. However, her interiority reads as more competent than conflicted; she accepts Thalos’s extraordinary claims with little internal friction or skepticism, making her journey feel slightly too smooth. The final choice is earned by her actions, but the emotional cost remains largely externalized in Thalos.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-established. The story earns her transformation through the central action of reconstructing the tail. However, the final paragraphs slip into over-articulated summary ("she’d rebuilt her understanding of what it meant to care"), which reads more like a diagnostic conclusion than a raw, embodied change, slightly blunting the peak moment's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal journey is well-embodied, particularly the connection between her physical scar and emotional pain. The final transformation is earned through her ordeal. However, the epiphany is articulated in over-tidy, diagnostic language (“bridges to understanding,” “honor the past without being chained to it”), which reads more like a summary of a therapeutic insight than a raw, in-the-moment realization, slightly flattening the character’s voice at its most crucial point.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the initial question to the final resolve. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly the physical reactions to the psychometric vision. The final shift to a life-long mission ("she’d spend the rest of her life uncovering them") feels slightly abrupt and overly grand for the preceding discovery, making the earned change feel a bit rushed and summarized rather than fully embodied in that final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but the characterization leans heavily on the "moonstruck dreamer" archetype without adding significant individualizing flaws. His interiority is lushly described but sometimes states his condition rather than embodying it through contradictory impulses. The final change is narratively earned, yet it feels more like a reward for following steps than a transformation forged through a difficult internal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael's transformation from passive observer to active cultivator is clear, but his motivation for the pivotal choice relies heavily on the woman's exposition rather than a deeply embodied internal conflict. The shift from guarding memories to saving imagination feels slightly abrupt. The line "He’d never understood the weight of absence until now" is a summary of an emotional turn rather than a dramatization of it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her single-minded pursuit. Her final choice to let go of the gear is a meaningful act of renunciation that provides closure. However, her internal conflict feels more stated than dramatized; we are told she seeks the "wild frontier of her mind," but we don't see contradictory impulses battle in the pivotal moments leading to her final, receptive understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The characterization serves the story’s allegorical function well, with Lira as the sage and Jorin as the initiate. Jorin’s arc from seeking certainty to embracing ambiguity is clear and earned. However, the characters feel more like vessels for the theme than complex individuals with contradictory impulses, particularly Lira, whose dialogue sometimes serves as direct thematic summary rather than revealing a deeper, personal interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elric’s motivation begins as an abstract philosophy but is effectively dramatized by the crisis. His internal conflict is palpable, but his final epiphany feels more intellectually derived than emotionally earned. The transition from a silent shadow to an articulate guardian is the story's core, yet the final, perfectly-phrased wisdom feels a bit too neat for a character who has never spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and potent, but her characterization relies more on description ("regally unpretentious," "diminutive titan") than on dramatized choices under pressure. Her competence is absolute, facing no internal conflict or meaningful setbacks, which makes her feel more like a function of the plot than a person navigating it. The story lacks a moment where her stated traits create a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her signature action—the tapping—is a strong, recurring character detail. However, her interiority sometimes relies on summary ("a mosaic of grief") rather than embodied experience. Kael's conversion from dismissive director to willing companion happens too quickly ("hesitated, then nodded"), feeling more like a plot necessity than an earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her core trait, "awkwardly confident," is demonstrated in her key interaction. However, the characterization is weakened by a tell-over-show moment where Jax’s conversion relies on off-page history ("He’d seen Lira’s predictions come true before"). The final two sentences also flatten her earned epiphany into a direct thematic statement, which reads as authorial summary rather than character-particular insight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Nana Marisol's motivation is well-established and consistent, rooted in her backstory as a revolutionary. Her actions align with her desire to "evolve tradition with intent." However, the pivotal choice to plant the embryo feels under-dramatized; the plants command her to "Choose wisely," but her decision is immediate, lacking a moment of tangible internal struggle between competing impulses, which slightly lessens the impact of her final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s interiority is specific and embodied, particularly the contradiction of her “quietly talented hands” now freezing from trauma. However, Mrs. Voss functions more as a thematic device than a fully drawn character; her dialogue, while kind, leans into archetypal wisdom (“Your talent isn’t just in your hands… It’s in your resilience”) that feels slightly too neat. Lila's final realization, "I want to anchor optimism in realism," is a diagnostic label that slightly undermines the earned emotion preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elias is both archetypal and specific, creating a compelling internal journey. His motivation, rooted in professional failure and existential dread, is clear and potent. The story excels at showing his internal conflict—the initial disdain for fragments warring with his eventual need to embrace them—as a series of concrete actions rather than just summary, culminating in the highly credible "rare, genuine" smile.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is powerful and clear, providing a strong anchor for the narrative. Her core trait of "serene anger" is effectively portrayed as a controlled, driving force, particularly in her decision to defy the elders. The interaction with the child provides a moment of genuine connection and insight, revealing Lira's capacity for gentleness beneath the anger. While her interiority is consistent, a deeper exploration of the contradiction between her "wild intuition" and methodical tracking could have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lirael's motivation is clear, but her internal state relies on diagnostic labels like "bravely conflicted heart" rather than fully embodied contradiction. While her actions show resolve, the interiority feels summarized with stock phrasing, which slightly undermines the earnedness of her final stance. Kael functions more as a catalyst for Lirael's thesis statement than a developed character, which is acceptable for the scope but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation to understand her father's legacy is clear and consistent. Her pacifism creates a meaningful internal conflict, embodied in her repurposing of his knife. The interiority is concrete, though some lines, like the analysis of the ballast as a "paradox," feel slightly too articulate and analytical for an in-the-moment realization, bordering on authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation as a “scientist and supplicant” is clear and consistent, driving his methodical actions. His coolness under pressure is well-maintained, particularly when faced with the goddess’s overwhelming sorrow. However, the characterization remains somewhat archetypal; his interiority is functional but lacks a deeper, contradictory texture that would elevate him beyond his role in the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and her transformation from passive observer to active agent is compelling for this length. Her core trait of being “devotedly observant” provides a strong, consistent through-line for her actions. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through her interaction with the pen nib, and the final cost of her choice is made tangible through her family's reaction, earning her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s motivation feels abrupt and declarative. The leap from hearing about the firmware to saying “I need to tether the firmware” is immediate and lacks the necessary internal struggle. The connection to her own past is asserted rather than embodied, and the final revelation that the guiding voice is her mother's makes Lira's agency feel guided and less earned, softening the impact of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is strong and purposeful. Her core identity as a “whimsical chalk artist” is not merely flavor; it is the central mechanic through which she engages with the conflict. The shift in her motivation from documenting a phenomenon to participating in it is earned and provides a clear arc. Her internal conflict over whether to "interject" is brief but effective, demonstrating a value system that is then tested and transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, built around the interesting paradox of a "gentle radical." However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract, declarative labels like "aberrant mercy" and "cradling empathy in arms of steel," which feel more like a thesis statement than an embodied emotional state. This diagnostic self-awareness slightly flattens the character, preventing a deeper, more specific sense of internal conflict from emerging through action and perception alone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his synesthetic interiority provides a unique texture. However, his competence is absolute; the story lacks a moment of doubt, internal conflict, or a meaningful struggle against the problem. His success feels assured from the outset, which slightly lessens the character's depth and the impact of his achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation as an “affectionate skeptic” is clear and consistently drives the narrative. His internal conflict is embodied through the somatic marker, a clever physicalization of his struggle. The final change feels earned through the on-page work, though the brief voice convergence with Mara's "willowglass hope" slightly dilutes the specificity of his internal state at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, but her interiority feels over-articulated, turning earned epiphanies into neat summaries. The line “The leaf’s journey mirrored her own” is a diagnostic statement that flattens the character’s struggle, replacing embodied discovery with a tidy conceptual parallel.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She proceeds with a frictionless competence, and her pivotal insights arrive as neat, unearned realizations rather than the product of genuine struggle. She functions more as a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her relationship with her father and her own lost courage. Her interiority is palpable, though it occasionally relies on slightly familiar phrasing like "the hollow where her courage used to live." The internal conflict between learned paranoia and the need for trust is effectively set up, but the final epiphany about courage feels more articulated than viscerally earned in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thaddeus is a consistent and well-realized sketch, but he lacks compelling internal contradiction. His motivation, "to distill complexity into essence," is clearly articulated but feels more like a thematic label than a lived-in drive tested by the scene. While his interiority is concrete, it approaches a diagnostic self-awareness that lacks the friction of a genuine struggle, rendering him more of a vessel for the story's mood than a character with unresolved pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. The reveal of her past self's connection to the oasis provides a strong, earned internal turn. However, her "zen-minded" nature sometimes presents as a static trait rather than a discipline tested by internal contradiction; the conflict remains largely externalized until the final vision.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions as a "fire escape gardener" provide a strong, concrete anchor for his worldview. However, the character's voice falters in the climax. The line, "Because after the final petal drops, you still have to water the stem," reads less like authentic dialogue and more like an authorial thesis statement, momentarily flattening his specificity into a thematic mouthpiece.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and earned. The internal conflict between honoring her ancestral past and forging an independent future is embodied in her interaction with the sundial. The final choice—"I see you, but I am not you"—is a powerful, earned renunciation that crystallizes her arc from a passive contemporary of the dead to an active pioneer. The change is credible and carries the felt cost of final solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, but her final change feels more like an intellectual acceptance of the story's theme than a deeply earned emotional transformation. The interiority is present but lacks the contradictory impulses of a genuine struggle; she moves towards the solution offered by Elara with little resistance. Elara herself functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a character, which makes the resolution feel guided rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence is well-established. The shift in her stance is visible in the final beat, moving from a reactive problem-solver to a proactive challenger ("Then I'll dam it"). Her interiority is concrete and goal-oriented, though it lacks significant internal contradiction, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and his defining traits—claustrophobia and "prudently adventurous"—create a functional internal conflict. However, this conflict is often stated rather than fully embodied, as in the line "Elias’s prudence warred with his adventure." While the final choice is decisive, the interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("clawed at his ribs," "steeled himself"), slightly diluting the specificity of his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s motivation is clear but over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness ("My motivation had always been to awaken dormant empathy..."). While her core traits are consistent, her internal state lacks compelling contradiction within the scene. Voss serves as a functional foil but remains a stock weary detective, weakening the relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and effectively drives the plot from investigation to a high-stakes choice. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("hands trembled") and the attribute "nervously confident" acts more as a label than a dramatized, contradictory state. The final line, while summarizing her choice, reads more like a thematic thesis statement than an embodied, in-the-moment realization, slightly flattening the character's voice at a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motivation to understand the mystery is clear and his defining action (playing the fiddle) is well-rooted in his established identity. His interiority effectively tracks his shift from confusion to belief. However, the stated trait "dynamically observant" feels like a label that isn't functionally demonstrated with a tradeoff, and his ultimate motivation ("to sculpt possibility") is delivered to him at the end rather than being an intrinsic driver from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but his central trait of "polished calm" is stated rather than demonstrated under pressure. The internal conflict is articulated as a philosophical question, not dramatized through contradictory in-scene impulses. The final emotional state of "peace" feels summarized and intellectually resolved rather than earned through a visceral on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and personal, and her core conflict between detached chronicler and vulnerable participant is well-established. The backstory of her exile effectively grounds her expertise and isolation. However, her climactic shift from fearing others’ pain to embracing it is slightly rushed, and the internal thought "healing begins with listening" veers close to unearned, diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is compelling. The change is earned through a specific, challenging confrontation with her past. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, and the final beat of interiority veers into diagnostic self-awareness ("the strength to carry it"), which slightly lessens the emotional impact by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is effectively externalized in the confrontation with her double. The re-framing of her quest from “chasing” to “heeding” is a strong character beat that forces a necessary shift in perspective. However, the pivot from “dread” to the final, world-altering choice happens very quickly, feeling more like a conceptual acceptance than a fully embodied emotional struggle in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her arc toward accepting her flawed nature is compelling. However, the epiphany feels overly articulated, especially the line "she saw her own recklessness not as a curse, but as a fiercely gentle force." This diagnostic label-speak in a peak moment slightly undermines the earned, embodied nature of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lenny’s characterization is strong, particularly the internal conflict between his need for factual insulation and the emotional pull of the artifact. The description of him as “confidently uncertain” is sharp and well-dramatized through his actions. His motivation is clear and compelling, and the change he undergoes feels earned, even if the final epiphany is articulated a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is strong and consistent. Her motivation is clear, and her primary trait—"kindly methodical"—is demonstrated through her patient, analogical approach, which directly enables the climax. The final shift in understanding is earned by her actions. While the internal conflict is subtle, the choice to use an ancient incantation over a purely scientific method reveals a compelling contradiction between her training and the arbor's demands.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The librarian is a compelling archetype, but characterization lacks deep internal conflict; its motivation is stated and served rather than tested. The visitors are functional, serving as vessels for the theme. The dialogue is overly sententious and acts as a direct conduit for the story's thesis ("Routine is a cage." / "Only if you let it be."), which flattens the characters into mouthpieces rather than allowing their motives to emerge from embodied, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation shifts from professional duty to a profound, almost spiritual calling, which is well-handled. His "heartbeat of a hesitation" is a strong micro-choice that reveals his character under pressure. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("he wasn't just an inspector; he was a conduit, a translator of latent radiance"), bordering on diagnostic self-awareness rather than a purely embodied realization in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-embodied, particularly the choice to stop her meds to regain a "raw, unfiltered edge." The transition from methodical chronicler to emotional cartographer is earned. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated with phrases like "healing required surrender," which reads more like a diagnostic summary than an in-the-moment, messy realization.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent, but her characterization remains thin. The "veiled dreamer" persona feels like an external label rather than an embodied reality, as her methods are purely analytical and focused. There's a lack of meaningful internal conflict; she proceeds with high competence and encounters no significant setbacks or difficult choices, making her feel more like a cipher-solving instrument than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a potent internal contradiction between her quiet profession and the supernova of her ambition. Her motivation is clear and the internal conflict is embodied in concrete, specific sensations like the "mulberry ache" and a "laugh, brittle as ice," avoiding abstract summary. The final choice to renounce power is earned, flowing directly from the cost she perceives in her vision, making the concluding Earned Stasis both credible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael's character is exceptionally well-realized through her actions. The integration of her dual profession, "beautician mortician," is not just a label but the direct source of the climactic solution—embellishing to stabilize. Her motivation is clear and her competence is balanced with a tangible struggle, making her final, unconventional choice feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her internal conflict upon seeing her sister is well-embodied. However, her interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate thematic summary. Realizations like "Forgiveness, she’d learned, was not a weakness but a seed..." and "The cycle of rebirth, she realized... was about choices" read less like earned, in-the-moment epiphanies and more like diagnostic labels, which slightly undermines the character's authenticity at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a compelling archetype, and his brief internal reaction to the cloak—"terrifying. And exhilarating"—provides welcome depth beyond his professional persona. Mira’s arc from suspicion to resolve is economical and credible within the scene. However, Elias's dialogue occasionally slips into articulating the story's theme directly, which slightly flattens his mysterious role into that of a mere mouthpiece for the author's ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation as a withholding mentor is clear and drives the plot. Lira's arc from curious apprentice to desperate seeker who takes initiative is well-executed and provides the story's central change. Elara's backstory of aging backward adds fascinating texture but feels slightly detached from her immediate tactical choices within the scene, which are purely pedagogical.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his reverence for a fading tradition. The final change from a lifetime of misunderstanding to a sudden epiphany feels slightly unearned, relying on the declarative sentence "Kael understood" rather than a more deeply embodied internal struggle. While his resolve is well-established, the shift itself lacks the texture of contradictory impulses acting in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his arc is complete, but the interiority relies on summary. The realization that the spire is a "mirror" is told rather than shown through a more complex, contradictory internal struggle in the moment. While his final choice feels earned, the emotional progression is slightly too linear, lacking the messy, embodied contradiction of a top-tier character piece.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, consistent, and effectively embodied through his connection to the key tag and his quest. The internal conflict between his mundane duty and his profound, hidden grief is established well. The final choice to leave the key is a strong physicalization of his internal shift, but the preceding epiphany feels slightly too articulate and less like a raw, in-the-moment realization, which holds it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s internal conflict between "quietly enthusiastic" curiosity and "stellar doubt" provides a solid foundation. The transition from skepticism to acceptance is the core arc, but the climactic epiphany feels slightly abrupt, more asserted than fully earned through a granular struggle. The character's final state is clear, but the emotional journey could be more embodied to elevate it from a strong concept to a visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is well-established, stemming from a specific past failure that feels earned. The internal state shifts convincingly from adrift grief to focused purpose, culminating in the resonant final state of “distant intimacy.” The choice to proceed despite the echoes’ resistance feels like a genuine test, though the explicit statement of his motivation (“Elias’s motivation had crystallized then…”) slightly weakens the interiority by telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his 'earnestly naive' nature is well-dramatized through his unwavering focus. Marla serves as an effective, grounded foil, and her slight shift in attitude provides external validation for the climax. The primary weakness is the line, “Madness is just devotion without a roadmap,” which reads as an overly articulate, diagnostic summary of the theme, slightly undermining the 'naive' trait it purports to explain.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between private hoarding and public guardianship is compelling. The final shift is earned through the scene's pressure. However, the epiphany is slightly weakened by an overly articulate internal summary ("The motivation... was hers, too"), which feels more like a thematic statement than a raw, embodied realization in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-grounded in her parental backstory, providing a strong core for her actions. The arc from seeking balance to understanding it as a "collision" is earned through the ritual. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into overly neat, summary-like epiphanies, such as "to let the flame of reason ignite the ember of instinct," which reads more like a thematic thesis statement than a raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored effectively in his mother's legacy. The final internal shift from seeing his role as a "burden" to a "covenant" is earned and provides a strong character arc. However, the actual process of solving the puzzle feels almost frictionless; he struggles with the weight of responsibility but not with the task itself, which slightly lessens the impact of his competence.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motivation to overcome numbness is clear and effectively drives the plot to a decisive choice. However, the character’s interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic language (“emotional numbness”) and thematic summary (“you’re what I could’ve been if I’d given in to fear”), which slightly undercuts the embodied struggle in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation and actions are consistent and well-grounded in his profession as a puzzle-maker. His shift from systematic analysis to intuitive action (planting the seed) is a believable character beat. The characterization is strong, but it lacks a significant internal contradiction acting under pressure; his receptiveness makes the final acceptance feel smooth rather than a costly struggle against a deeper flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marlowe’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poignant, driving the entire narrative. The central contradiction of his character is perfectly captured in the phrase "mournfully eager," which is not just stated but embodied in his trembling hands and unwavering expression. His actions, while bizarre, align perfectly with his established goal, creating a character who is both deeply sympathetic and compellingly strange.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and potent, rooted in the concrete ache of being “dimensionally homesick.” The internal conflict between her sworn duty and personal desire is palpable, culminating in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The characterization is strong, showing her feral nature and strategic patience through action rather than labels, though the final line’s articulation of the theme is a touch too explicit for a character who is otherwise defined by quiet action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation to "interrupt destiny" is clear and compelling. The internal conflict between his "stoically sensitive" paralysis and the need for action is well-dramatized, culminating in an earned and costly final choice. The character arc from hopelessness to decisive, self-destructive agency is powerful and avoids tidy resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving his actions from investigation to dismantling. His guiding mantra, "Discard assumptions," is successfully externalized in the climax when he physically discards components. While his professional competence is well-established, his internal emotional landscape remains somewhat uniform, with the final laugh feeling more like a conceptual realization than a deeply earned emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his pivotal choice is well-grounded in his established empathy. His interiority is mostly strong, particularly when his resolve wavers. The characterization is slightly weakened by the explicit labeling of his "resiliently positive" nature, which feels more stated than consistently embodied, especially in the final neat smile which could have carried more of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s motivation is clearly established, but her interiority remains somewhat abstract. Terms like “fever dream architect” and “rational enchantment” function more as high-concept labels than as deeply embodied traits that generate contradictory impulses in the scene. The final realization feels more like an intellectual acceptance of a new paradigm than a change earned through visceral, personal struggle, slightly undercutting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—feeling adrift while teaching others to navigate—is well-established. Her actions are consistently driven by her desire to find her own place in the "unfolded horizons." The character arc is earned, though the interiority sometimes articulates her goals with a bit too much directness, such as "She wanted to feel the pull of something greater."

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lila’s motivation to “protect vulnerable voices” is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is concrete, especially in the moment she first hears the pulse. However, the explicit labeling of her core concept as “incidental heroism” and her attribute as “persistently curious” reads like direct summary rather than fully embodied traits, slightly flattening the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a specific past trauma that drives every action. The internal conflict between her obsessive quest and her debilitating claustrophobia creates palpable tension, especially as the water rises. The final choice is not a grand action but a moment of seeing and accepting, which is earned by the preceding struggle and has a visible emotional cost in her tears.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's motivation to "fetch wisdom from failure" is clear and consistently drives his actions. His internal conflict—the contradiction between the machine's binary logic and his own lived reality—is dramatized through embodied actions like counting heartbeats and tracing the porcelain shard, avoiding abstract summary. The final choice to embrace the "error" is an earned renunciation of a "clean" resolution, with the cost felt in his acceptance of a "messy" future.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storyteller's motivation is compelling, complex, and deepens perfectly at the climax. The final confrontation with her fear is not a simple summary but an embodied choice with a visible cost. The turn from fearing oblivion to declaring "I am the extinction!" is a powerful, earned reversal that demonstrates profound character change through action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between scientific observation and mystical experience is embodied, not just stated. The influence of her mentor is skillfully integrated, providing the psychological key for her pivotal choice to embrace the metamorphosis. The final shift in her character from researcher to an undefined new role is earned by the preceding events and carries a palpable cost—the potential loss of her old life.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, creating a believable core. However, the character's final epiphany is delivered as an over-articulated thematic statement ("Lira finally understood: breaking free wasn’t about destruction..."), which feels more like an authorial summary than an earned, embodied realization in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his “respectfully rebellious” nature. The internal conflict is present, but weakened by moments of over-articulated self-awareness, such as when his motivation is summarized as finding “where broken promises heal.” This tells rather than embodies the core drive, slightly flattening an otherwise compelling character.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elio’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from the physical search to the climactic act of singing. The interiority is generally well-handled, but a few moments lapse into summary, such as "Elio’s motivation had always been to find beauty in the quiet," which states the core drive rather than fully embodying it in that specific beat. The final change is earned, but the internal conflict leading to it is more of a gentle progression than a struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from restlessness to a decisive, character-affirming action. The arc from quiet archivist to confident 'keeper' is earned. However, her interiority occasionally relies on convenient labels like "sanely eccentric," which summarizes her core trait rather than letting it emerge purely from contradictory actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core artistic ritual is well-realized. The final change is earned through the story's climax. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "cipher of longing" rather than fully embodied emotion, which slightly distances the reader from her internal state just before the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and the central contradiction of "unassumingly bold" is effective. However, his interiority sometimes relies on stock phrasing ("eyes burned with a quiet intensity"), and the final emotional shift is more summarized than embodied, slightly weakening an otherwise solid portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his profession and personal history. The transition from a general forty-year obsession to a specific, urgent quest is well-handled and earned by the dream's inciting incident. His actions—using the sextant, unfolding the journal—are concrete expressions of his established traits. The final shift in motivation, from solving a mystery to recovering memories, feels like a deep and fitting evolution for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael's characterization is strong, with her contradictory impulses (helping vs. distancing) embodied in the act of walking backwards. Her motivation is clear and demonstrated through action. The visiting woman is less developed but serves her role as a catalyst effectively. The final, rare smile feels earned, showing a subtle shift from guarded archivist to fulfilled mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent. Her actions are driven by a clear, embodied desire to "preserve the color of wonder." The characterization is strong, but the final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("she knew now that wonder was not a finite thing"), moving from earned interiority to thematic summary, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation to escape her past by mending things provides a strong initial contradiction to her task of unraveling. Her internal conflict—fear versus duty—is shown effectively through her admission, "I'm afraid." Elias functions well as a catalyst, but his dialogue veers close to the stock "wise mentor" archetype ("The stars are aligned," "You'll find what you need"), which slightly flattens his character. Mara’s final shift from fearful restorer to a "lucid" and "awake" individual is earned and nuanced, avoiding a simplistic "happily ever after."

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization remains somewhat thin. His defining trait, "methodically curious," is demonstrated effectively through his actions. However, the final epiphany feels more stated than earned; the profound shift in worldview ("to find empathy in the unsaid") arrives abruptly as a neat summary rather than the culmination of a visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and consistent, rooted compellingly in her mother's disappearance and her scientific discipline. The interiority is specific, connecting quantum decay to grief. The final shift in understanding is earned, but the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of diagnostic summary, like describing her own "quiet, analytic ache of holding on too tight," which feels more like an authorial label than an in-the-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and poignant, driving the entire narrative arc. His interiority is well-rendered, particularly in the shift from specific messages of grief and longing to a broader, more hopeful gesture for an unknown recipient. The internal command to "Speak" is a powerful moment of self-confrontation that feels earned, leading to the quiet catharsis of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s transformation from dutiful servant to inquisitive seeker is compelling and earned within the short space. Her motivation shifts believably upon discovering the diary and goggles. However, the final interaction feels slightly over-articulated; the line “affectionate in her detachment” reads as an authorial summary rather than an embodied character trait, and her pressing the widow's chest is a bit theatrical for the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s motivation is exceptionally clear, tying her professional theory to a deeply personal grief for her mother. The internal conflict is shown, not just stated, through her focused work despite Voss’s skepticism and their precarious situation. The final choice to embrace her new understanding (“it’ll change *me*”) is a powerful, earned resolution that forecloses the path of seeking external validation, showing a clear and costly character change.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lira’s face-blindness is not a gimmick but a core element of her perception, driving her focus on textures and patterns, which in turn motivates the story’s central discovery. The internal conflict between professional duty and personal curiosity is resolved in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable, and the final realization of overcoming her own limit is earned and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is consistent and drives the plot, but her interiority remains somewhat thin. The final epiphany is delivered as a summary ("Images flooded her mind: ancient cities, forgotten wars...") rather than an embodied experience, which lessens its impact. While her actions align with her traits, the absence of a deeper internal conflict or contradictory impulse keeps the characterization strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his legacy. However, his final internal shift feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on an unearned epiphany. The line about mending "what was broken in himself" summarizes the change rather than fully embodying it, which slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise solid internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She is presented as purely altruistic without discernible flaws or contradictory impulses that would complicate her choices. The moment she "reexamined her approach" resolves instantly without forcing a change in tactics, making it a token beat rather than a crucible. Her actions are aligned with her motives, but the absence of any genuine struggle or cost to her own being makes her feel more like a benevolent plot device than a complex character.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her grandfather's legacy. Her internal conflict regarding her own flaws feels slightly declarative ("she had to accept her own flaws") rather than fully dramatized through a difficult choice in the moment. However, her core values are revealed effectively through her interaction with the puppet head and her final, costly action of singing.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Kael’s reluctance is not just stated but embodied in his jerky movements and curses, creating a compelling internal conflict between his duty and his resentment. The micro-choices, like placing the pebble, are driven by a clear hierarchy of values under pressure: follow the blueprint, avoid the birds, save the traveler.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation to "atone" is clear and her professional lens as a chemist provides a unique framework for her insight. However, the characterization is weakened by dialogue that leans into diagnostic label-speak, particularly during the climax. Lines like, “We’ve been like this... Afraid to finish the song,” state the emotional subtext so directly that they flatten the moment, replacing embodied emotion with a summary of it.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and provides the story's core tension. Her interiority is well-rendered through her initial confidence and subsequent anxiety. However, the final epiphany feels more stated than earned; the line "In that moment, she understood" summarizes a complex internal shift, slightly flattening the character's arc from a struggle to a neat conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Nessar’s motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. His unique ability to taste memories is not just a label but his primary mode of interacting with the world, which makes his interiority specific and compelling. The internal conflict between understanding remorse and becoming entangled in it is well-dramatized, culminating in an earned change where he learns to carry the burden rather than simply analyze or erase it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She functions more as a flawless archetype for the story's theme than a person with internal contradictions. The trait "empathetically decisive" is stated rather than tested; her path is linear, without a moment of genuine struggle, doubt, or a choice between competing values that would reveal a more complex interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his professional failure, providing a strong internal conflict that mirrors the external task. The trait "chaotically precise" is effectively dramatized in his actions under pressure. However, the motivation is articulated in slightly over-written terms like "archeologist of abandoned dreams," which feels more like a thematic label than a raw, internal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her role as an archivist. The transformation at the end from scholar to "keeper" is a strong beat. However, her core trait of being "prism-minded" is more of a label than a demonstrated process in her choices; her successful navigation relies on standard puzzle-solving and intuition rather than a uniquely multifaceted way of thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is fierce and consistent, driving her to the point of physical harm (“strumming until her nails bled”). Her actions are well-aligned with her goal, and her interiority is concrete. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of diagnostic self-awareness, like the explicit label “Empathy in motion,” which summarizes a complex internal state rather than letting the embodied action carry the full weight of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Alaric's motivation is rooted in a compelling internal contradiction—a heresy that deepens resolve. The memory of Lira is not just reflection but a pivotal micro-choice that reframes his understanding, earning the final epiphany. The closing emotional note of "hopeful melancholy" is complex and perfectly captures the cost of his long exile against the quiet victory.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from a physical problem (the lock) to a conceptual solution (resonance). Her character as an "eclectic pacifist" is successfully demonstrated by her choice to abandon force for a more empathetic method. The final change to a state of understanding is earned, though the interiority becomes slightly less character-particular and more authorial in the concluding paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between ambition and patience is well-established. The change she undergoes is earned through her struggle and realization. However, her emotional journey, particularly her moments of doubt and the shift after the dream, feels more summarized than embodied, keeping the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, her interiority lacks significant conflict; her primary struggle is with an external mystery, not contradictory internal impulses. The final shift from a presumed goal of exploitation to one of protection is very sudden and lacks the dramatized internal debate that would make the earned change feel more profound.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Anya’s motivation is clearly established through the mentor's backstory, grounding her professional diligence in personal history. However, her interiority struggles to bridge the gap between a rational investigator and someone who accepts the port is a "hungry machine." This leap feels more like a conceptual necessity for the plot than an earned character transition, particularly since her "rapidly adapting mind" is stated but not fully dramatized in a way that justifies accepting this new, fantastical reality so readily.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to "certify wonder as essential" is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she reads more as a confident agent of change than a person struggling. Veyra's transformation from skeptic to believer provides a strong, visible arc, but it serves more to validate Lira's quest than to create a complex dynamic between them. The characters are functional and well-defined for their roles but lack the deeper contradictions that would elevate them to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions effectively from the inciting incident to the climax. The internal conflict between resolve and grief is present, but the final epiphany feels more like an acceptance of a new concept than a resolution born from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene. The change is earned, but the internal mechanics feel slightly too tidy for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his arc from analytical arrogance to emotional humility is well-earned. His method of "borrowing personalities" provides a perfect frame, with the payoff in the final line being resonant. The change is slightly weakened by that final sentence, which summarizes the transformation a bit too neatly instead of trusting the preceding image of his tears to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kail’s characterization is strong, with his "jittery" nature shown through concrete actions and internal conflict rather than just stated. His motivation evolves credibly from duty to a need for understanding. The final shift to confidence is earned, but slightly weakened by the explicit statement, "For the first time, he understood," which summarizes the change rather than fully embodying it in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and personal, driving the narrative effectively. The internal conflict between her grounded nature and her "fanciful" ideas is established well. The final shift to a "bitter and free" laugh followed by peace is a strong, earned emotional beat that shows character change without resorting to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a “wistful hope” that drives her to endure isolation and engage with the mysterious puzzle. The final act of sacrifice is a powerful renunciation earned by her established character. Her interiority is generally well-handled, though a few phrases like the realization hitting her “like a physical blow” are slightly generic for this level of prose.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jorin’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "quietly determined" nature, creating a believable progression from meek craftsman to savior. The characterization is effective for the story's length, showing his resolve through action rather than lengthy interiority. However, the on-the-nose articulation of the theme during the climax ("Resilience isn’t born from safety...") feels less like an organic thought under duress and more like a diagnostic label, slightly flattening his voice in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his final choice is well-earned, rooted in a powerful internal conflict between caution and compulsion. The interiority is generally strong, but it occasionally dips into stock phrasing ("Kael's mind raced"). The final epiphany, while thematically sound, is articulated with a degree of self-awareness that feels slightly less immediate than the embodied emotion preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s transformation from a reticent man defined by duty to one who finds meaning in quiet connection is earned and compelling. His interiority is concrete, and the shift is shown through his growing anticipation and final, rare smile. The motivation—initially curiosity, then a deeper need for connection—is clear and progresses naturally. The final earned change, accepting a new kind of light, lands with the felt cost of the enduring physical darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Herald's motivation is clear and her internal shift from observer to active agent is well-earned. Her defining trait—laughter in a tempest—provides a strong, unique anchor for her character. The final epiphany, however, is slightly over-articulated ("the dawn wasn’t just a time of day. It was a choice..."), stating the theme directly rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lin's motivation is clear, urgent, and well-rooted in her transformative surgery. Her actions follow logically from her desire to understand her new perception of the world. However, the final resolution of her internal conflict is slightly over-articulated, with lines like "The tea house would be her sanctuary..." reading more like a thematic summary than earned, in-the-moment interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his interiority is specific to his unique profession, blending meditative calm with professional curiosity. His actions, like methodically dismantling the sextant during a storm, effectively reveal character. The story successfully earns his final shift in understanding, but the internal conflict remains subtle; a more pronounced struggle between his duty (deconstruct the wall) and his discovery (map the dreams) could have sharpened the characterization further.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions are perfectly aligned with her role as a keeper. Her interiority is well-rendered through her perceptions of the magical setting. The characterization is slightly held back by a lack of sharp internal contradiction acting in the scene; she is weary but fundamentally resolute, making her struggle primarily external. The final emotional state of "exhausted but peaceful" is earned, though the phrase "her heart light" feels a touch sentimental, simplifying the complexity of her ongoing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and her arc is complete, but her defining trait of "keen empathy" is summarized rather than dramatized through a specific, costly action. The interiority is concrete, yet the final emotional shift feels slightly unearned due to this lack of embodied demonstration earlier in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his arc from passive observer to active participant is well-earned and emotionally resonant. The internal conflict is nicely embodied in his hesitation to touch the impossible bread. However, a few key phrases of interiority, like "tenuous absolution," feel overly articulate and authorial, slightly breaking the otherwise immersive viewpoint by labeling the theme too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is explicit and her actions are consistent with her meticulous nature. The brief, contrasting moment of anger—slamming her fist—is a strong beat that effectively shows her breaking point under pressure. While her interiority is clear, it lacks deeper, simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and deepens with the story’s central revelation. The internal conflict between her inherited duty (“hush”) and her personal horror is powerfully dramatized in the climax. The final choice to accept the “comforting unease” of her father’s legacy demonstrates a character change that feels earned and complex, not simple or summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation as a “luminous skeptic” is established immediately and drives every action. His internal conflict between rational inquiry and inexplicable phenomena is embodied through his use of the compass and his sensory tasting method. The final change, where the taste of copper fades to “lavender and regret,” is a powerful, earned reconfiguration of his worldview, showing the cost of his new knowledge without overt summary.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character’s motivation is clear, potent, and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between commercial stability and creative starvation is well-established and resolved through a decisive on-page act. Emotions are effectively embodied, particularly the "chest ache" and "trembling" fingers during the climax, grounding the symbolic action in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, personal, and drives the narrative effectively. Her core trait, embodied by the quill, is expertly woven into the climax. The change in her perspective at the end is earned and powerful, demonstrating a shift from recovering the past to nurturing a future. The secondary character serves their function efficiently, though the final dialogue skirts thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “preserve the color of wonder” is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her choice to be seasonally mute is a strong, character-defining trait that is shown rather than just told. However, her interiority remains slightly too serene and lacks a moment of meaningful internal contradiction or struggle, reading more as the execution of a perfect vision than a process involving difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara-7’s motivation to resolve her inner static is clear and compelling. The internal conflict is elegantly dramatized through her shift from ignoring the glitch to confronting its source, leading to the earned realization of "fragmented wholeness." Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, rooting her final choice in a believable evolution from programmed containment to chosen integration.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clara's motivation is clear and consistent, but she functions more as an empathetic vessel for the mystery than a character with compelling internal contradictions or flaws. The secondary characters are archetypal and serve their purpose as information sources efficiently. The final emotional beat is affecting, though the name coincidence feels a bit convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his defining trait as a "lyrical code breaker" is consistent, but he functions more as a flawless instrument than a character experiencing internal conflict. His immediate, perfect competence in deciphering every poetic and kinetic puzzle without a moment of misinterpretation or struggle makes him feel less like a person and more like a key perfectly shaped for the story's locks. A moment of genuine doubt or a flawed first attempt would have grounded his brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and potent, rooted in the loss of his wife. However, the emotional progression feels too tidy; the shift from personal grief for his own memories to a generic, noble purpose of guiding others is an unearned epiphany. This rapid resolution lacks the contradictory impulses and felt cost expected at a higher level, making the final character state feel more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The summoner's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she is highly competent and proceeds through her task without a moment of palpable doubt or a difficult trade-off. The story demonstrates her skill but misses an opportunity to reveal deeper vulnerabilities or contradictions under pressure, as her success feels assured from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and economical. Elias's motivation shifts credibly from intellectual curiosity to active participation, anchored by his profession and his established patient nature. The woman's motive is clear, and their relationship, built on "agreed upon lies," provides a solid foundation for the plot. The line "Because you’re the only one who’d believe me without laughing" perfectly justifies his acceptance, making the final choice feel earned despite the swift timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lirael's internal conflict as a "charmed skeptic" is well-realized and consistent, with her analytical thought ("Through resonance structures") providing a compelling friction against the magical events. The motivation to process her past is clear and escalates logically into the final ritual. The final transformation is earned by the preceding internal work and the on-page action, with the cost making the change feel substantial and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, with her interiority (“tasting of iron and regret”) and embodied actions (trembling fingers, the willed act of using the cursed thorn) perfectly aligned. The characterization is potent and consistent. The only slight hesitation is a level of self-awareness that verges on being overly articulate, but it's executed within a lyrical voice that largely sustains it.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative from the inciting incident (the frayed song) to the climax. His change from seeking knowledge to accepting a sacred duty is earned. However, his interiority lacks significant contradiction; his path is one of earnest seeking without a compelling internal struggle or flaw that complicates his choices, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, but his characterization lacks depth. There is no significant internal conflict; he pivots from his initial problem to a new, successful method without any dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse. The final choice feels emotionally correct but comes at no visible cost, making him more of a wise, detached medium than a protagonist engaged in a difficult crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation as a “net-mender philosopher” is clear and consistently drives his perceptions and actions. The interiority is specific and embodied, successfully linking his craft to his worldview. The final epiphany is earned through his journey and observation, avoiding the feeling of a stock realization, though the characterization lacks a strong internal contradiction acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her competence is demonstrated through action (reassembling letters). The shift from "truth" to "survival" at the climax is earned by the escalation of stakes. However, the line “But Mara’s motivation wasn’t just truth—it was survival” is a moment of telling over showing that slightly flattens an otherwise solid internal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation to decipher the past to shape the future is clear and consistent. His interiority is particular, viewing the city as a "circuit board gone feral" and the storm as a "language." The final shift from relic to catalyst is earned through his persistent engagement with the prophetic frequencies. However, his internal state is sometimes conveyed through high-level summary ("his allegiance shifted") rather than fully embodied contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his arc from vagrant to "keeper" is emotionally earned. His interiority is mostly effective, though phrases like "gleaned redemption" lean toward labeling the emotion. The character's core transformation is well-executed, with his final purpose feeling like a believable renunciation of personal ambition in favor of communal connection.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's core conflict between his logical, engineering mind and the intuitive "song" of the key is well-established and compelling. Motivation is clear and actions are consistent. The characterization is slightly weakened by the on-the-nose self-assessment "logically emotional," a label that explains the conflict rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael's motivation and internal conflict—impatience versus the need for patience—are clear and drive the narrative. The transformation into a "softly purposeful" individual is earned through the on-page struggle and failure. However, the internal conflict is more summarized ("Patience," he muttered) than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a single moment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her arc toward defiance is legible. However, the internal leap from experiencing the lantern’s power to the immediate, certain conclusion that Cole has been using it to manipulate her feels more like an assertion for plot convenience than an earned deduction. This moment of realization lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied struggle expected at this level, slightly undermining the otherwise solid character work.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Father Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent with his stated trait of being "deliberate." His internal conflict between professional skepticism and spiritual hope is legible. The change is earned through the interaction with Mrs. Elms and the powerful symbol of the clockwork heart. However, the final paragraph shifts slightly into summary ("he knew what he must do"), which somewhat dilutes the power of his internal decision-making process by telling instead of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in a specific obsession that drives every action. Her interiority is well-embodied, particularly her frustration and dawning realization. The final shift to "irreverent awe" is earned. A minor point of friction is the slightly too-articulate epiphany, "Ah. So you’re a *translator* too," which verges on telling the reader the thematic shift directly, rather than letting the subsequent action fully embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the narrative. Her actions align with her role as a "memory keeper" obsessed with a cold case. The final choice is earned, but the internal state relies on some stock phrasing like "heart raced" and a concluding summary ("coalesced into a single, unshakable resolve") which slightly weakens the embodiment of her final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, and her actions are consistent. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic self-awareness or thematic summary, particularly the phrase "only by mapping empathy onto action could she quiet it." This declarative quality slightly flattens the character's internal struggle, making her feel more like a vehicle for the theme than a person experiencing a crisis. Her competence is well-established, but the internal conflict feels more described than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a well-realized numbness. Her interiority is strong, though it occasionally veers into overly-articulate self-diagnosis, as with the repeated phrase "The fold in patience." The heirloom parasol tip is an excellent object choice, revealing her contradictory impulses—clinging to fragile history while seeking an end. The final emotional shift is earned through action, though the dialogue "We all are," feels a bit too thematically neat, slightly flattening a complex moment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is articulated with academic jargon ("nurturing intersubjective understanding") which reads as authorial intrusion rather than organic character thought. While his actions are consistent, this initial framing feels ungrounded. Lila’s emotional shift from absolute numbness to laughter is rapid, relying heavily on Elias’s aphoristic wisdom, which slightly undermines the earnedness of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her core skill is well-defined. The “strangely honest” attribute is given a key moment when her mask falls, but it feels more like a label being confirmed than a trait that forces a difficult, costly choice within the scene. The prophet is functional as a catalyst but remains a sketch, limiting the depth of their interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes lapses into thematic summary. Lines like "Lila believed in collective healing" and her goal "to transmute pain into a masterpiece" feel slightly too articulated, like authorial labels rather than embodied thought. The final earned change, crystallized in the word "enough," is strong, but the path to it could show more internal contradiction in the moment rather than summarizing a pre-existing philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's motivation is clear and his internal arc from reticence to resolution is well-defined. However, the epiphany feels slightly rapid and intellectually driven, with the emotional shift happening a bit too smoothly. The phrase "weathered innocence" reads as an authorial label rather than an embodied, contradictory state experienced by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is strong and memorable, driven by the compelling internal contradiction of a "prophet" who cannot remember his prophecies. Elias's motivation is clear and his actions—the ritual with chalk and driftwood—are a concrete expression of his internal state. The final shift from desperate searching to quiet acceptance is earned and symbolized powerfully by the bolder chalk line, showing a change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is well-established and consistent. However, his capability escalates implausibly from a "sage camera repairer" to a cosmic engineer who can intuitively decode and rewire universal forces. The transition from mending lenses to restructuring reality with a soldering iron feels unearned, making his climactic competence feel more convenient than credible.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in both professional duty and personal history. However, her interiority occasionally slips into overly diagnostic or thematic statements, such as "The method was simple: hymning the mundane," which summarizes her process rather than embodying her thoughts in a high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives the plot effectively. However, her characterization as "quietly deliberate" is demonstrated as pure competence, lacking any internal conflict, flaw, or meaningful struggle that would test this trait. Her success feels inevitable rather than earned through overcoming a personal limitation, which keeps the characterization from achieving top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, a compelling blend of skepticism and a deep-seated need for answers rooted in personal loss. Her internal conflict is visible in her actions—testing thorns while seeking to understand magic. The final shift from skeptic to someone who accepts the garden's nature feels earned by Elias's revelation, though the speed of this change is compressed by the story's length. Elias serves his role as catalyst effectively, though he is less a fully-fleshed character than a necessary reflection for Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and her internal conflict—misunderstanding her mother's call for "stillness"—is resolved through the physical act of polishing. The arc from "chasing storms" to the quiet renunciation of releasing the pearl is earned and emotionally resonant. The final choice has a visible cost, making the character's change entirely credible.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied in her transformation of the data center. Her internal conflict between preserving her grief ("trapped time") and allowing it to evolve is well-dramatized through the pendant. The dialogue occasionally verges on being too thematically articulate ("I wanted to graft new meaning onto old wounds"), slightly flattening the subtext, but the core emotional progression is earned and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Clara's motivation as a "conflicted novelist" is specific, deeply felt, and drives every action. The internal conflict between her disbelief in omens and her belief in "the weight of unfinished things" is established early and paid off. Her earned change is dramatized through the decisive act of deleting her ending, a choice that carries the cost of abandoning certainty. The 9+ quick test is met, as this choice is a direct result of the preceding causality with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her established dreamer/tinkerer persona. The final shift in understanding from an individual fix to a communal responsibility is earned and well-supported. The characterization is strong, but it avoids deep internal contradiction in the peak moment, favoring externalized effort and awe, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation to "translate heartbeats into maps" is clear and compelling, and his defining trait of patience is masterfully shown through action rather than told. The characterization is strong, with embodied emotions like "fingers ached" and a "trembling finger" grounding the magical stakes. The final epiphany is earned by the meticulous physical and mental effort preceding it, making the internal change feel like a direct consequence of his struggle and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a well-realized character whose primary trait ("peripherally focused") is skillfully dramatized through his methods, rather than just stated. His internal conflict regarding the "cellar of reason" provides thematic depth. The characterization is strong and consistent, though the internal contradiction reads more as a philosophical stance than a conflict actively shaping in-scene choices.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his interiority is embodied through his craft—trembling hands, the rare smile. The internal conflict between his professional duty and his personal burden is deftly handled, culminating in a powerful moment of renunciation. The final choice not to touch the locket constitutes an Earned Stasis that feels both inevitable and costly, revealing a mature and complex character arc within a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her grief, driving her specific, embodied actions. Her interiority is rich with sensory detail, and the central conflict between the hollowness of loss and the will to create is compelling. The character arc from raw grief to a new, carved understanding is earned and credible. A minor deduction is for a line like "the method she’d chosen to process her grief," which veers slightly toward self-diagnosis rather than pure, in-the-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veyra’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is effectively externalized through the ghost. Her final act of renunciation—dropping the camera wheel—is a well-earned choice stemming from her established exhaustion. The dialogue with the ghost ("Because you haven’t forgiven yourself") borders on being too direct, slightly undermining the subtext, but the scene's emotional weight carries it through.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her stated trait of “functional creativity.” However, her interiority occasionally relies on labels like “stoic wonder” and abstract summaries of her state, such as her restlessness mirroring the terminal’s decay, rather than showing these through deeply embodied, contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between order and wildness is well-dramatized through her actions. The pivotal moment where fear dissolves into curiosity is believable, and the final shift in perspective is earned and nuanced, avoiding a simplistic escape narrative. Her contradictory impulses during the encounter with the bear—freezing in fear, then reaching out in wonder—are rendered effectively in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, the interiority relies on abstract summary ("a key to understanding the architecture of lies") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The characterization is more told than shown, particularly in the reflective passages, which prevents it from reaching the highest tier of execution where internal conflict is embodied through action and perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation is clear, consistent, and well-rooted in his philosophical nature as a seed collector. His defining trait of patience is demonstrated through his actions, making his final acceptance of a more abstract mission feel earned. While the mysterious woman functions more as a thematic catalyst than a fully-fledged character, this is appropriate for the story's length and focus. The characterization is very strong, avoiding cliché and providing a solid anchor for the story's thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is concrete, if highly lyrical. The character is well-realized for this length, and her final shift in understanding feels earned by the preceding mystical experience. A slight weakness is that her internal voice is so consistently elevated that it can feel more authorial than personal, lacking modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corvin’s motivation is well-established and embodied through his actions and desolate state. His internal conflict is present, particularly in the desperate, “half-mad theories” that reveal his blend of hope and despair. However, the characterization weakens at the climax with the arrival of Elder Thalos, whose dialogue serves mostly as validation, and Corvin’s reply (“Not me… We did. Together.”) feels more like a generic thematic platitude than an earned, character-specific realization.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation and internal conflict are clearly established and compelling. Her actions—the gentle lie to the child, the steady response to the man—are consistent with her character as a firefighter trying to outrun her father's legacy. The final moment of interiority, however, veers slightly into over-articulated self-awareness ("Compassion, she thought, wasn’t about erasing the past...") which slightly undermines the power of the final image by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s core paradox of being a "realistically imaginative" skeptic is established well, creating a consistent internal conflict. Her motivation, "defiance," is clear but leans more towards a label than a deeply embodied drive shown through costly choices. The final moment where her skeptic’s heart still demands proof is a strong, authentic beat that honors her established characterization rather than offering a simplistic conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lumin's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a compelling internal conflict between heritage and personal longing. However, the character's core change is delivered via exposition from the ghost rather than being forged through a difficult choice or action in the scene. The moment of revelation ("Lumin understood") feels more passive than earned, softening the impact of their final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marlow's motivation is clear and his internal journey is legible. However, the climactic expression of his character change—the poem—veers into diagnostic self-awareness. The line "Grief is not a hole, but a door" functions more as a thematic thesis than an authentic, embodied emotional utterance, slightly undermining the earned subtlety of his prior contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied, particularly her connection to her grandfather's wisdom. The character arc from dutiful technician to intuitive mediator is earned. The phrase "her ethically diligent mind" is a minor instance of telling rather than showing, which slightly flattens an otherwise strong portrayal of competence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to “discover the shape of intentions” is clear and consistently drives the narrative. The change from a “blithe” nature to one “tempered by the weight of her discovery” provides a subtle but earned arc. However, her initial blitheness feels more asserted than demonstrated, as her on-page actions are primarily contemplative and methodical, creating a slight disconnect between the label and her behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks significant internal conflict. She faces external skepticism but her internal state is one of near-unwavering conviction, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a person struggling with contradictory impulses. Her competence is well-established, but the resolution feels more like a validation of a static belief than an earned change or a costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted effectively in the “story famine” premise. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific details, such as her breath fogging the dial and her throat tightening. The character is consistent and her quiet joy at the end feels earned, though the internal conflict lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory impulse, remaining a steady, diligent pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her character is vividly established through her tools and her mask, which functions as potent, embodied backstory. The internal conflict between her drive to create and her acceptance of impermanence is palpable. Her final micro-choices—removing the mask, touching the portrait, then replacing the mask—feel earned, showing a brief moment of vulnerability before re-committing to her difficult path.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between his philosophy and Mara's pragmatism is well-dramatized. Mara serves as an effective secondary character, applying direct pressure. However, some interiority feels overly articulated and self-aware, such as redefining "agony" on the page, which slightly undermines the otherwise strong, embodied characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clara’s motivation is consistently held and compelling, rooted in her grandmother's philosophy. The line "harmony was not the absence of conflict, but the art of holding it gently" provides a nuanced core that elevates her beyond a simple savior archetype. Elias functions well as a catalyst, but his interiority is secondary. The final earned endurance avoids a simplistic resolution, making Clara's stance credible and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and embodied through her actions and internal reactions. The conflict between absorbing trauma and her goal is dramatized well in the pruning sequence. The final reveal of the notebook provides a solid, forward-looking anchor to her character, but the trait "informally wise intuition" reads as a label rather than a demonstrated quality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara's motivation to reignite wonder is established and consistent, providing a solid foundation for her arc from passive observer to active agent. Her defining trait of "involuntary truthfulness" is cleverly re-framed from a social liability into the very tool needed for the resolution. Voss is a functional archetype, but Clara's internal shift feels earned within the story's compact frame.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and her unique perceptual mode is compelling. Lira’s interiority is specific and drives the narrative forward. However, the story lacks a meaningful internal conflict; her journey is one of methodical execution rather than a struggle between contradictory impulses, and her ultimate success comes without a discernible cost, which slightly lessens her dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her arc is complete, but her interiority feels thin. Her acceptance of three world-shattering revelations is instantaneous and lacks the embodied struggle or contradictory impulses expected under such pressure. The final choice feels more like a logical step than a deeply felt, costly decision, which slightly undermines the character's depth at the story's most pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The characterization is strong and coherent, with Kael's motivation for the quest being both specific and poignant. His final shift from obsessive pursuit to acceptance is earned and lands with emotional weight. The trait "balancedly daring" is slightly told rather than purely shown, which is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lila's motivation—to find tangible proof of remembered kindness—is established with specific, embodied detail ("cataloging kindnesses like fossils"). The internal conflict between her methodical hope and encroaching despair is not merely stated but shown through her insomnia and graying canvases. The final choice to ask for teaching is an earned, active resolution that comes with a visible cost: abandoning her solitary art for a slow, collaborative act of memory, fulfilling the 9+ test for characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between hope and dread is established. Her character is revealed through the specific, embodied action of baking bread, linking memory and purpose. However, the final shift from a private decision-maker to a public teacher feels slightly unearned, as the challenge of gathering followers is resolved by coincidence, which softens the arc of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, consistent, and directly tied to his specific skills. His internal state is well-realized, especially the blend of "triumph and terror" at the climax, which feels earned. The backstory of his father provides a solid emotional anchor without overstaying its welcome. His actions are driven by a specific, character-rooted obsession, making his choices feel inevitable and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her progression from terror to resolve is well-earned through concrete actions. Her key choice to "unbosom" fear by standing still is a strong character beat. Vey functions effectively as a catalyst, though his characterization is thin until the final lines, which works for the story's length. The character work is strong, held back only by the slightly generic feel of the advisor role.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Leeward's motivation is potent and consistently dramatized through her struggle to create harmony. Her interiority is revealed through embodied action, particularly the contrast between the first flat strike and the later resonant ones. The character arc, a mini-odyssey from discord to an earned, exhausting order, is credible and complete within the scope. A perfect score is held back only by the slightly too-explicit thematic statement she mutters, which momentarily tells rather than shows her core philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in the loss of her mother and her professional obsession as a cartographer. Her "quietly driven" nature is demonstrated through her choice to ignore the elders' warnings, providing a solid foundation for her actions. While her interiority is functional, some emotional reactions rely on stock phrasing like "hands trembled" and "breath hitched," slightly flattening the specificity of her experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation as a historian is clear and consistent, driving her actions effectively. Her internal shift from seeking a simple truth to understanding a complex one is earned. However, Tomas functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character, and Elara's internal conflict lacks a deeper, contradictory impulse acting simultaneously within the scene; her progression is logical but not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is well-established with a compelling professional/personal layering. The internal conflict between her stoic exterior and sensitive interior is legible, particularly when her thoughts "roared" in the pavilion's silence. The final action provides satisfying closure for her arc, though the "stoically sensitive" descriptor feels slightly more like a label than a consistently dramatized contradiction with on-page trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the plot effectively. The shift from an intellectual goal (understanding the past) to a moral one (sharing the truth) is earned by the climax. However, the character traits feel slightly applied rather than fully embodied, with recurring labels like "logical page indexer" and "tranquilly perceptive" acting as authorial signposts.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lantern maker's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a tangible loss. Her internal state is well-realized, particularly the shift from regretful craft to active confrontation. However, her self-awareness feels slightly too articulate at times, as in "Grief, she’d learned, could not be buried; it had to be folded," which summarizes an internal process rather than dramatizing it through a present-tense choice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, born from specific trauma and driving every choice. Her internal state is well-embodied, particularly in the bitter laugh and the physical clenching of the geode. However, the climactic line, “It’s *anger*. It’s *grief*. It’s the part of us that refuses to die!” slips into diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining the raw emotion of the moment by over-articulating the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her competence is well-demonstrated through action. The shift in her goal at the end is earned. However, the character trait "perpetually surprised" feels like an unfulfilled label rather than an embodied element that influences her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's core contradiction—a professional liar compelled to uncover the truth—is established immediately and drives the entire narrative. The final choice to reveal the truth is not an unearned epiphany but a costly renunciation of his trade, earned through the story's events. The internal conflict is made tangible through his interactions with the watch and driftwood.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Clara's motivation, rooted in a past failure, is clear, embodied, and drives her choices, particularly her handling of the pull. The final renunciation of the object is an earned change with a palpable cost. Elias is an effective counterpart, and his final reveal that he carries a similar talisman provides a powerful, resonant moment of connection that elevates both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s internal conflict between seeking safety and embracing uncertainty is well-established and consistent. Her motivations are clear, stemming from past regrets and a fractured relationship with her grandfather's legacy. However, her final emotional state is articulated with a bit too much diagnostic clarity, as seen in the line, “The backlash of regrets, she decided, was just the ocean’s way of reminding her she was alive,” which feels more like a tidy thematic summary than an embodied, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between calculation and empathy is well-defined. Her final shift to "jaded wonder" is a credible, earned change for this length. However, J.T.'s characterization suffers, functioning more as a thematic mouthpiece than a person; her dialogue, particularly the line defining empathy, feels like a diagnostic label that momentarily flattens the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong, with Lira’s internal conflict—clinging to humanity while knowing she must let go—providing compelling tension. However, the final epiphany is slightly over-articulated ("to shed the old self was not to lose it, but to honor it"), reading more as authorial summary than a fully earned, embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, rooted in the specific void left by her mother. Her actions are driven by a believable internal conflict between grief and a desire for connection. The final emotional shift feels earned, though the mother’s dialogue ("repentance isn’t a place. It’s a choice") veers close to summarizing a character discovery that the preceding actions had already beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and compelling. The contradiction between her pacifist identity and the need for confrontation is well-dramatized. However, the climactic realization—“the truth that peace is not the absence of war but the presence of courage”—is an over-articulated platitude, a moment of diagnostic summary that slightly undermines the embodied struggle that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and her transformation is credible within the story's logic. However, her core internal conflict is articulated more by the stranger than demonstrated through her choices prior to his arrival, and the final paragraph over-explains her new purpose, slightly diluting the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kieran's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on labels like "vigilant" and a motivation that "burned like a ember" rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Elara serves as a functional ally who provides a key piece of information, but the dynamic between them is purely operational. The characters are competent vehicles for the plot, but they lack memorable specificity or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict between duty and terror is well-dramatized. However, the final epiphany—*“The promise wasn’t to control the patterns, but to witness them”*—is articulated with a diagnostic clarity that feels slightly unearned and less embodied than the preceding struggle, softening the peak moment of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, and his internal conflict between hiding and revealing is powerfully rendered. His emotional state is well-embodied, particularly in the phrase "furiously tranquil." The shift from vigil to reckoning is earned, though the subsequent line explaining the contradiction ("The fury was the storm...") is a minor analytical intrusion that slightly dilutes the moment's power.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivations are clear and drive the narrative, culminating in a credible shift from rivalry to collaboration. Kael’s interiority is well-handled, showing his thought process. However, the final line of his internal monologue ("And that, Kael thought, was the point all along") slips into thematic summary, slightly flattening the character into a mouthpiece at the last moment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cedar’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-realized. The friendship with Marla provides a crucial, grounding counterpoint to his internal chaos. However, the final epiphany feels slightly told rather than fully embodied; the line "The poem wasn’t a contradiction—it was a map" is too diagnostic, stepping on the powerful image that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a clear internal conflict between a desire for control (“strategically creative”) and a surrender to chaos. Clara’s motivation is tangible, and her shift from feeling caged to defiant is earned through a sequence of concrete micro-choices. The final action is a powerful culmination of her internal struggle, foreclosing passivity with the felt cost of facing an uncertain future.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her role is compelling, but her core internal conflict feels underdeveloped. The "surge of luminous doubt" is introduced and then dismissed almost immediately as a "test," which lessens the impact of her final resolve. A more sustained, embodied struggle with this doubt would have made her final choice feel more costly and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the narrative forward to an earned emotional climax. Yorick, however, functions more as a wise archetype than a fully drawn character; his motivation to help is assumed rather than felt, making him a beautifully rendered but somewhat hollow plot engine. The dialogue, particularly Yorick's, is often aphoristic and serves as thematic declaration rather than natural conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through her shift from cosmic research to earthly decay, with interiority embodied in actions like scraping dust samples; contradictory impulses between order and chaos drive micro-choices, culminating in earned humility with felt professional cost. Strength lies in her flawed persistence, revealed in the chrysalis monitoring that reweights her values. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "adjusted her spectacles" slightly genericizes embodiment, but it doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's motivation to find purpose post-survival is clear and intensifies through adaptive actions like reading frost patterns, rooted in her artist's traits; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her hollowed creativity and contradictory impulses between survival and meaning-seeking. The final renunciation of old art forms for new panels earns stasis with felt cost of past hollowness, visible in her mind tracing lines in dust. Relationships and status dynamics are absent as it's single-POV with no other on-page characters, so ignored per guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, intensifying through embodied emotions like trembling hands and silent gestures, culminating in an earned reconfiguration where she redefines silence with visible gratitude over fear. Elias applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing relational choices that alter her isolation. Interior contradictions shine in her wary yet hopeful interactions, with micro-choices like leaving notes revealing value hierarchies. The capsize memory anchors her flaws without stock phrasing, though Elias feels slightly underdeveloped in distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's stubbornness and weariness drive consistent motivations, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and dream-induced gasping revealing internal conflict; his shift from resistance to purpose feels earned through micro-choices, such as welding the lens despite doubts. Marisol's presence as a secondary character applies pressure, forcing relational growth. However, some interiority leans toward stock phrasing, like clinging to "permanence," slightly diluting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira's motivation to foster trust is clear and intensifies through her persistent actions, culminating in the bell-ringing declaration that reveals internal resolve with a felt cost in community unease; interiority is concrete, embodied in her handling of the bell, though secondary characters like the council apply pressure without deep status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her past-life memory, driving her spiritually curious actions with embodied emotion in breaths and warmth; however, internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, as in the pilgrim question replay without contradictory impulses clashing mid-journey.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation as a hedge maze designer obsessed with time's texture is clear and intensifies through her actions, with embodied emotions in the surging visions showing contradictory impulses like fascination and overwhelm. The final renunciation of unraveling time for storytelling feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the inert fragment and lost visions. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen when she clutches the fragment and feels time fraying.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation to liberate seeds is clear and rooted in her title, intensifying to compel her final act of hurling the vial, but interiority relies on somewhat stock embodiments like "breath caught" without deeper contradictory impulses in scene. The single-POV focus shows her patience constraining choices, yet flaws like unchallenged competence limit genuine struggle, especially in the unchaining moment where chains "snapping" feels unearned without prior buildup. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored; overall, her hierarchy of values emerges in the climax but lacks visible cost in micro-choices earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's disappearance, intensifying through concrete actions like harvesting absences and severing the root, leading to an earned endurance with felt emotional cost in the exhilarating pain. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her pursuit despite the ache of absence. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws through micro-choices, such as adjusting the hearing aid amid shimmering colors. However, backstory reflections occasionally summarize without tilting present stance as sharply as possible.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation as a thief of illuminated moments is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her savvy traits that drive choices like using the lily code; interiority is concrete, with embodied hesitation before offering the photo revealing contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of her stolen memory earns a meaningful change with felt cost, foreclosing her pattern of only taking. Relationships are absent, so ignored, but single-POV interior contradiction shines in the offering moment.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael's motivation to craft safe zones is clear and rooted in his glassblower traits, intensifying through reflections that compel his final renunciation with felt emotional cost from past abandonment. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in his whimsy amid entropy, as when he narrates tasks to lend weight. The bookmark interaction reveals character under pressure, earning the ending's endurance of flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's motivations are clear and rooted in her phobias and betrayal discovery, intensifying to compel her confrontation and final stance; interiority is concrete with embodied fears, like trembling legs fueling agility, but occasional diagnostic labels like "genetic hand-me-downs" slightly abstract her flaws. The mother-daughter relationship acts as a crucible, forcing a charged renunciation at the café with visible emotional cost. Micro-choices, such as reciting the notes, reveal her value hierarchy effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation to map the endless night is clear and intensifies through her persistent sketching despite physical aches and environmental distractions, with embodied emotions like trembling lips revealing internal contradictions under pressure. The obsession with hushes is shown through concrete actions, such as tracing mortar cracks, rather than mere labels, earning the final renunciation of fear with a felt cost in her isolation. No second character limits relationship dynamics, but single-POV interiority is character-specific and avoids stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The robot's motivation to find the origin of thoughts is clear and intensifies through curiosity unlocked by the program, compelling choices like touching the violin and entering the loop. Interiority is concrete via whirring processors and flickering logic core, with embodied contradictions in remaining composed amid overwhelming timelines. The final renunciation of fear for peace shows earned endurance with felt cost of temporal overload, though secondary characters like the scientist feel underpressured in their brief appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation from meticulous routine to curiosity is clear and intensifies through the ticket discovery, leading to an earned conceptual shift in his role as translator of silence. Interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into stock epiphanies, like "words were overrated," without deeper embodied contradiction. The final renunciation of writing in logs, opting for a doodle, reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, elevating the score despite minor unearned insights.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to prove human touch over algorithms is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying through her interaction with Joren, where she demonstrates techniques that lead to his change. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her polishing actions, but some stock phrasing like "gnarled but steady" hands slightly flattens specificity. Joren's skepticism provides secondary pressure, forcing Elara to articulate her values, culminating in an earned endurance that forecloses reliance on tech with felt cost in the maze's response.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies to compel the recalibration choice under pressure, with embodied emotion in sweat and fogged breath, but interior conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, relying on summarized racing thoughts rather than in-scene tension during the nexus flicker.

    Lirael's motivation as a fault-tolerant oracle fraying after fever is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like tracing the illustration while questioning certainties, compelling her descent with felt cost of abandoning her role. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in actions like smudging roots, revealing hierarchy of values where survival trumps quantification. The final renunciation earns stasis by prior accumulation, foreclosing her old life with visible anchoring in the village.

    Elias's motivation as a skeptical explorer is clear and intensifies through contradictory impulses like thrill versus doubt, culminating in an earned renunciation by leaving the valve, with visible cost in its newfound weight; however, interiority occasionally leans on stock phrasing like "skepticism fraying" without deeper embodiment in peak moments.

Minor weakness: traits feel slightly archetypal without deeper flaws complicating choices mid-journey.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's mellow patience and adaptive optimism are consistently shown through her interactions, like obliging Mara's request to play the cello and gently guiding her to imagine childhood wonder, leading to a credible shift in Mara's skepticism. Mara's bluntness and gradual softening provide a relational crucible that forces Elara's nurturing motivation into action, with embodied emotions in her laughter like wind chimes. However, interiority relies on somewhat stock phrasing, such as Elara's heart feeling "light," without deeper contradictory impulses under pressure. The final hand-squeeze reveals a hierarchy of values with felt relational cost, but flaws feel one-note without compounding mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The priest's motivation to illuminate hidden assumptions is clear and intensifies through his focused actions, rooted in consistent traits like rhetorical precision, with interiority embodied in murmurs and mind-racing moments. Emotions are contradictory, blending determination with laughter at the unraveling, and micro-choices like activating loops reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost in the anchor's destruction.

Elias applies secondary pressure relevant to her conflict, forcing choices that alter their relationship by the end.

    Lira's motivation to map ignorance and predict the future is clear and intensifies through her persistent observations and writing, compelling her to endure physical costs like cramped hands; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her trembling hands and closed-eye imaginings. However, internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, and her flaws are somewhat hedged without deep moral ambiguity. The quill's use reveals her values hierarchy effectively, but the final renunciation of old journals reads as tidy rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation to resurrect stories from dust is clear and rooted in her backstory, intensifying through her feverish scribbling during the broadcast; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and a tightening throat revealing contradictory impulses of fear and determination.

    Lira's motivation to capture fleeting emotions is clear and intensifies through her ritualistic actions, with embodied contradictions like steady hands but racing mind revealing internal conflict under pressure. The mask serves as a crucible for her blind spots, enabling her to weave truth without revealing herself, and her final renunciation of completion forecloses permanence with visible fatigue as cost.

The whisper "This is for you" exemplifies her hierarchy of values, layering longing with ambiguity.

Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her breath catching at the violin and humming to wrap around discord, revealing contradictory impulses between fear of loss and hope for unity. However, Elias feels somewhat one-note with his "expectantly resigned" tone, lacking deeper internal conflict or micro-choices that alter status dynamics on the page. The final endurance of harmony in the sanctuary earns stasis with felt cost of the fraying world, but stock phrasing like "voice like melted honey" slightly flattens her individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lumen's incisively kind nature is effectively shown through telepathic impressions that guide Mara without force, creating contradictory impulses in her choices, as seen when Lumen projects urgency to reveal the ampoule, constraining Mara's fear with warmth. Mara's motivation roots in her grandmother's loss, embodied in her trembling hand and decision to drink, earning a meaningful change with the cost of reconfiguring tragedy as sacrifice. However, interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "breath hitched," slightly diluting specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's grim optimism and balanced daring are vividly embodied through contradictory impulses, like pacing loops while calculating odds, culminating in the earned renunciation of possessing the dice with felt exhaustion as cost.

Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in his bitter mutterings and exhilaration, with actions revealing character under pressure. The meaningful change—stepping beyond fate—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his old pariah status with felt cost in the "wild, unfamiliar" exhilaration.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara's motivation as a clean slate seeker is clear and intensifies through her descent and confrontation, with embodied emotions like clutching the baseball revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; however, J.T.'s secondary presence lacks status dynamics that could sharpen relational crucible, and some interiority veers into stock phrasing like "voice brittle," slightly diluting specificity at the visions moment.

Interiority is concrete, shown in his burning ember-like drive and jaw-tightening under pressure, revealing embodied emotion without stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation to escape censorship and rarefy his poetry is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like the ache in his chest, driving micro-choices such as opening the envelope and writing despite the storm. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in his furious tranquility, with scars revealing flaws that complicate his reckoning without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's mechanical arm effectively embodies his motivation from a past "debate gone wrong," revealing character through action like flexing gears, but interiority leans abstract and philosophical without deeply contradictory embodied emotions under pressure. Elyra's "diplomatically fierce" trait drives dialogue and strikes, creating status dynamics that force Kael's evolution, though her flaws feel less flawed and more balanced. The final renunciation of victory for collaboration shows earned endurance with conceptual cost, but motivations could intensify more viscerally in the climax graze on his shoulder.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cedar's motivation to rebuild from molting personalities is clear and intensifies through concrete interiority, with embodied contradictions like trembling hands and shifting eyes revealing flaws under pressure. The relationship with Marla acts as a crucible, forcing a stance on acceptance with visible cost in his ongoing fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's motivation to escape chaos and find refuge is rooted in consistent traits like her "strategically creative" improvisations, intensifying to compel her descent into the hidden room; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her repeated failures to fix the clock versus her final unstrategic playing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)

However, some emotions lean toward performed abstraction, like the "chest tightened," slightly diluting specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Yorick's motivation as a patient, reflective tutor is consistently embodied through his deliberate speech and bonsai-tending actions, culminating in his guidance of Lira with visible emotional depth; Lira's drive to uncover unspoken truths feels rooted in her backstory but borders on stock grief without deeper contradictory impulses in scene. The final apologies reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost, though Lira's arc relies somewhat on summary rather than simultaneous internal conflict. Strengths in Yorick's perceptual specificity elevate this, avoiding diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—cosmic detachment vs. greenhouse intimacy—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (scraping dust, monitoring chrysalis). The final renunciation of institute metrics for humble observation carries visible cost: “She ignored them.” Flawed passivity (waiting on a chrysalis) complicates her agency yet feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirael’s interior contradiction—“survival left her hollow” vs “need to discover purpose”—drives the crawl through the crevice. Embodied emotion in the shard warming her thigh crystallizes the cost. Final stance (to etch panels, teach frost-mapping) is earned, but “pauses” idea edges close to theme-articulation rather than lived flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lirael’s interiority is embodied and specific (trembling hands, breath visible) and her motivation to “rectify silence” is consistently rooted in the trauma of the capsize. The relationship with Elias acts as a crucible that forces her to renegotiate her stance toward communication, culminating in the earned stasis of embracing silence as language. Micro-choices (adjusting the case, attaching electrodes) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: “silently expressive” edges toward label-speak mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s stubbornness is embodied in his refusal to open the crate and his gruff exchanges with Marisol; the shift from “burying secrets” to “carrying knowledge” is earned through the dream of the goldfish and the visible cost of staying beneath the waves. Interiority is concrete (“his hands trembled,” “brine and old paper”). The final renunciation—trading shovel for quill—carries felt cost and closes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her hands brushing dust from the bell, her resolve “gently persistent”—and her choice to expose the givers is earned by prior beats. The final renunciation of anonymity carries visible social cost: donations stop, notes replace gifts, and she accepts the widow’s squeeze as payment. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; the lone POV is consistent and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her breath-work as conduit is embodied and specific—but the pilgrim memory is delivered as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, muting the internal stakes. The final renunciation (to carry rather than capture) is earned, yet the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile obsession with time’s texture is embodied in every gesture—but the final “quiet certainty” feels slightly abstract, not fully paid for by prior embodied cost. The retrocognitive trait is dramatized under pressure, yet her decisive shift from unraveling to remembering is more asserted than earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing dust, the copper-wrapped quills—but the “promise to herself” is asserted rather than dramatized. The chains biting her wrists and the hesitation before the star key show embodied cost, yet the turn from captive to liberator feels slightly compressed; one more beat of visible doubt would seal the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic perception and tactile engagement with the forge root her in scene. The contradiction between her scientific precision and emotional hunger (“battered but marveling”) is embodied, not stated. The final choice to wear the forged aid carries visible cost: she now hears “the absence where love should be.” Yet the father’s absence is more reported than dramatized, blunting the betrayal’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—sweat-slick gloves, smirking under the hat—but the “quietly savvy” trait is asserted more than embodied; the photograph trade carries felt cost, yet the mother backstory is sketched in a single line, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses (genetic fear vs adaptive drive) are embodied in trembling hands and micro-choices; the final refusal to hand over the shell crystallizes her stance with felt cost. Mother-daughter status shift is only off-stage, so relationship crucible is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her aching fingers, the quill’s resistance—but the “mild obsession” never complicates her choices; it merely labels her. The final smile feels unearned because no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit-17’s curiosity is clear, but interiority stays abstract (“obsession: to find where thoughts come from”) rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic realization is narrated rather than dramatized through micro-choice, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. Still, the robot’s composed endurance and final renunciation of further loops create a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet meticulousness is embodied in concrete micro-choices (sorting tickets, fetching lens) and his interior contradiction—fear of silence vs. curiosity—drives the arc. The shift from passive observer to active translator is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he abandons written logs for silent doodles. Lira remains a catalyst rather than a crucible, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile tending of vines and marbles embodies motive—but Joren’s shift from skeptic to apprentice feels compressed; the cost of her stance is implied rather than dramatized in her body. Still, her contradictory impulses (defiance vs. caretaking) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s interiority is vivid—thermal gauntlets clicking, sweat trickling—but her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear of destabilization) are stated more than dramatized. The final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of the near-catastrophe is narrated rather than embodied. Still, her micro-choices under pressure (hands flying across the panel) align with motive and show a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—rational skepticism vs. occult fascination—are embodied in trembling hands and the deliberate dip of the program; the final promise “I’ll finish it” is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (she is soaked, program lost). Interiority stays concrete, but a few stock phrases (“ghost stories whispered,” “chill down her spine”) keep it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is touchable (spectacles, graphite smudges, palm on cold glass) and her contradictory impulses (oracle vs. mess-bearing conscience) act simultaneously in-scene. Fault-tolerance is driven by visible flaw (guilt over hidden seismic data) that escalates choices and spawns a credible renunciation at closure. Micro-choice hierarchy (truth vs. safety) is pinned with cost as she abandons the station.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s reckless curiosity and skeptical stance are embodied through tactile micro-choices (turning the valve, fumbling the recorder), but interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“he’d sought proof…found something worse”). The final renunciation—leaving the valve—earns its cost via prior dread, yet the emotional layering feels slightly compressed for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is vivid—dreams of silence, the stranger’s face in the pool—but the shift from witness to seeker is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the journey’s cost yet feels slightly abstract because the stakes of “judgment” remain conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s wonder-forward temperament remains vivid and consistent; every choice—offering the curl, guiding Mara’s memory—issues directly from it. The final gesture of tucking the curl into Mara’s pocket earns its moment because earlier beats have tied the keepsake to shared childhood vulnerability with visible warmth in Mara’s palm.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's odd-historian craving to rescue forgotten stories is vividly embodied; micro-choices (kneeling, trembling, palm to wall) show contradiction between collector’s urge and fear of dragon-awakened silence. His interior monologue stays concrete through embodied perception rather than labels. Cost crystallises when the wall’s chorus rises: he has retrieved the collective dream but must now bear its constant mutter. One deduction for slight competence inflation—his instant decoding of tapestry runes feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained hands, tremor at the letters—yet her contradictory impulses (obedience to father’s design vs. desire for autonomy) crystallize only in the final typed fortune. The cost is felt when she hurls the flare, sealing her new allegiance. A hairline slip: the dockworker’s off-stage reaction dilutes the embodied price.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“fingers brushing the cold metal”), yet the priest’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. Motivation is stated (“to illuminate”) but never tested by a live dilemma; the final step into the nexus feels inevitable rather than costly. Palette and pedal serve as extensions of will, but their handling never forces a visible trade-off. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael's duality—yearning artist vs. time-sick loner—fuels every micro-choice; but the interior contradiction never fully collides with a beat-level mistake or irreversible cost, so the arc plateaus at earned ache rather than definitive renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for grounding while fearing it—surfaces in embodied beats (“hovered a foot above the ground… felt it ebbing”). The final renunciation lands with visible cost (feet touch stone, tablet crumbles), but the middle timelines feel sketched rather than lived, muting the stakes of each alternate self.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s interiority is embodied (numb hands, hollow chest) and her micro-choice to fit the copper wire is character-specific. Motivation (defeat numbness) is clear and intensifies. However, the final “found her voice” is slightly abstract; the cost (tears, ache) is felt but not foreclosed with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias exhibits clear contradictory impulses: scientific detachment collides with intuitive urgency. The transition from "he’d always avoided politics" to taking a vial directly into peril roots the interior shift in on-page beats; yet the woman-in-lab-coat functions as a generic prompt rather than a second character under status pressure, constraining the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s cautious-nose trait and inherited grief are embodied in micro-choices (hovering over the vial, steady fingers after). The shift from fear to embrace of grief is credible, though the interiority drifts toward gentle abstraction rather than raw contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, coat of verses—but the “ethically playful” trait is asserted rather than embodied in choice; the final renunciation of the rope is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “tracing the cracks,” the damp violin strings—but the final choice to “hold up the bowl” and declare its purpose feels slightly abstract; the cost of that renunciation (the chronic hush she relinquishes) is implied rather than dramatized on her body. The micro-choice sequence is coherent, yet the contradiction between her restlessness and the calm acceptance at the end is not fully earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—spectacles, coat, blotter petal—but the moment of handing Lira the vial lacks a visible cost or contradiction; his detachment stays flat rather than fracturing under pressure. The “professionally thorough” trait is shown early and late, yet never complicates the choice. Motivation is stated, not dramatized in conflict. Lira’s presence supplies pressure, but Elias’s stance is unchanged, yielding a credible but low-impact Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s shrewd eye for freight and emotional reserve stay consistent, but her interiority flirts with “therapy names” (“unspoken things”) and her on-page micro-choices after receiving the locket remain emotionally legible, not materially transformative under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s “boldly sympathetic” trait is dramatized through his obsessive search and the embodied ache of loneliness, but the interior contradiction between yearning and fear of rejection is only sketched; the final shared ache lands as earned yet not fully costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s curiosity and inherited skepticism are embodied in micro-choices—dropping the pencil, twisting the pendant—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into inherited proverb rather than fresh contradiction. The final endurance (sketching the giant as guardian) carries cost, but the shift from skeptic to believer feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is luminescent with contradiction, the glass-eye memory tightening her resolve; the refusal to exit grief feels earned. Her single overt decision—aligning the eyes with the mosaic—creates the entire climax and cannot be removed.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s kindly methodical nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices—mapping chases, caching, prying the grille—each revealing a hierarchy of values. The interior contradiction between invisibility and guardianship is present but compressed; the final “felt seen” turn is credible yet slightly rushed. No secondary character pressure on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s decision to stop intervening with the hellebore is embodied and motivated by clear contradiction: her lifetime habit of control versus the plant’s necessity to shapeshift. The moment of physical restraint (Mara seizing her wrist) externalizes her internal struggle and sets up the final cost—she now has to relinquish the identity of controller. The emotional arc tracks. Some interior summaries (“she realized that transformation wasn’t to resist”) flirt with diagnostic speak but remain within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marin's contradictory impulses—yearning for meaning while fearing memory—are embodied in her refusal to sell sleep for "starlight." Her micro-choice to grind the amber into pigment visibly alters how she sees the island and her own role. The final smile and pocketed brooch represent Earned Stasis whose cost is the surrender of her old way of "threshing" meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s curiosity and hesitation are embodied in micro-choices (touching the crystal, closing fingers around the pearl), but the interior contradiction between wanting control and accepting chaos is stated more than dramatized; the final “steady, unpredictable hum” hints at earned change yet lacks a visible cost on her body or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s reporter-diligent drive pulses through every return to the damaged sites, but her interiority hovers—scars are named more than embodied—and the climactic choice (restoring the trumpet) feels granted rather than wrenched from her fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    There is visible internal contradiction (artistic yearning vs analytical caution), but the shift from mapping cracks to punching a ticket feels slightly expedited rather than wrestled with, limiting the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara is credibly drawn as a skeptical yet open seeker; her shift from detached observer to engaged collaborator is embodied through micro-choices (tracing the tile, taking the risk to transcribe), and her interior monologue stays rooted in sensory moment rather than analytic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s boredom is embodied early and flips to fear when the amulet reacts, but interiority leans on stock phrases (“mind that withered from boredom”). The final choice to release the amulet is foreshadowed yet feels slightly abrupt; cost is present but abstract (“fell through”). Lira’s arrival supplies relational pressure, but her dialogue is expository rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and stakes-driven; the “ink clarity” moment crystallizes her agency. Father remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation (fair-trade math) is clear but abstract until the final beat, slightly softening cost. Still, her micro-choices under pressure read individual and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Althea’s studious compulsion and tactile reverence for her notepad are vivid, but the interior contradiction—between disciplined restraint and ecstatic surrender to the lamp’s hum—never sharpens into a visible cost or irreversible choice; the final smile feels unearned because no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael/Marcus carries contradiction vividly—living man walking with his own death certificate—but interiority tilts toward exposition of synesthesia rather than embodied cost; no interior contradiction visible at the instant of recognition by the skeleton. Final stasis feels declared, not paid through micro-choices; cost named (“He would make them remember”) rather than shown in this beat. Compelling but short of earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—logic vs wonder—drives every micro-choice; her embodied grief and curiosity feel lived-in. The final renunciation (she stops debunking and hums instead) is earned by the shell-cello experiment and carries a visible emotional cost. Yet the astronomer and wife remain off-page voices, so relationship-as-crucible is absent and the score caps below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—preserve soul vs appease suits—drives every beat; the chip’s tactile weight and graffiti decoding are embodied choices. Yet the final stance crystallizes more through collective chant than her own irreversible sacrifice, muting personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s curiosity and sense of legacy are palpable, but the interiority drifts into summary (“she’d come here tonight to photograph…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the drones’ indifference never truly threatens her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s tactile “seeing” is embodied and specific; her interiority stays grounded in heat and vibration. The micro-choice to trust the water basin’s light reconfigures her stance toward Marlow and her craft. Cost is felt: she accepts perpetual, never-ending repair work as the price of clarity. Dialogue with Marlow is spare but status-legible, reinforcing her autonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s interiority is vivid—her “dry wit faltering” at the map, her tracing condensation as micro-choice—but the final renunciation (“maps are lies”) feels slightly under-cooked; we don’t see the cost register in her body or next action, only in a smile.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s patience and vocation are sketched vividly, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the single on-page choice—striking the fork—does not visibly cost him anything, so the arc feels more symbolic than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—smash vs. wait—are dramatized in the rusted stopper beat; her renunciation of trapping memories carries visible cost in the empty vial. Interiority is embodied (fogged glass, salt-sting lungs) and character-specific. The final choice to release rather than hoard is earned by prior causality and forecloses her original goal with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt, defiance, need to overwrite his father’s lies—are embodied in the lattice’s bite and his hovering. The final “I’m writing” stance is earned by prior beats where the lattice blooms and the doppelgänger demands authorship. Cost is visible: the copperlight dims to silver, the chamber dissolves, and the ghost’s pride is silent. Interiority stays concrete, though the father-ghost’s pressure is more atmospheric than interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ghost bride’s layered motive—vengeance, mercy, and self-release—drives every beat, but her interiority is delivered in summary rather than embodied micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned yet stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her raw fingers, the humming, the silent pact with the sleepwalker—but the “hauntingly optimistic” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a costly choice. The final smile feels slightly unearned because the stakes of failure (what she personally forfeits) remain abstract. Still, her micro-choices (threading the robe, aligning plates) track motive cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motives—to “restore faith”—anchor every step, but her interiority leans on stock phrases (“felt then—the faith…as a choice”) rather than concrete embodied tension. The final kneel is visually earned, yet cost reads more atmospheric than viscerally paid. Emotional state is grounded in posture and lantern flicker, avoiding label-speak, keeping flaw visible but not dramatized in scene. Still, character reads as singular, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to secrecy while craving connection—are dramatized in her tactile tracing of chalk and trembling acceptance of the letter. The final resolve to teach children encodes a visible cost: perpetual self-erasure. Interiority is specific and embodied; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: the vendor’s taunt is generic and doesn’t pressure her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Zara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the “twinkle” when she smiles—but her final choice (to reveal the chart’s mutable truth) is more gesture than decision; the cost is implied rather than embodied. Jaxon’s pressure is present yet generic, so the relationship crucible is under-used. Still, the contradiction between outward “decoration” and covert rebellion is dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her throat tightening at the spirits’ paradoxical tenderness, her palm to the earth—but the “moment before deciding” remains abstract; no single micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. The shard’s warming and smoothing is a felt cost, yet the shift from regret to courage is more stated than dramatized. Still, embodied emotion and consistent motive keep her above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the coral fragment and cast function as extensions of her contradictory impulses. The final act—placing the coral on the table—earns its cost through prior emotional investment. Minor slip: “lotus-hearted ache” edges toward label-speak, though it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s contradictory impulse—mourning versus resurrecting joy—drives every beat; the fresco fragment and light-painting are micro-choices that visibly cost her detachment and safety. The final grinning “Everything” is earned by prior causality and carries a felt price: the fog’s silence is permanently broken. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tight chest) and avoids label-speak. Secondary pressure from Marla is brief but sufficient to force Lira’s stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marisol’s curiosity and methodical playfulness are embodied in tactile choices (kneeling, adjusting the dish, whispering). The hobo nickel’s emotional weight is credible, yet her interiority flirts with label-speak (“inherited his restlessness”) and the final beat is more observation than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s rogue-scholar charm is vivid in ink-stained fingers and poetic quotes, but interior contradiction is thin; his “spark of defiance” is declared rather than embodied under pressure. Lillian’s status as gatekeeper is clear, yet their relationship never becomes a crucible—she admits him with minimal cost. The final grin is earned, but the emotional price feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.0)
    Interiority and motive arc are clear and rooted; lyrical distance softens emotional cost too much. Voice specific, yet passive in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s “gently systematic” trait is embodied in her precise dismantling of the chime and her refusal to accept irreparable loss; the contradiction between method and improvisation is visible in the moment she sings into the cracked tube. Interiority stays concrete—tightened chest, fingertip on the fissure—without therapy-speak. The final choice to let the crack become part of the new harmony costs her the illusion of perfect preservation and is earned by the prior beats of testing the orchids’ response to her childhood hum. Secondary pressure from the hologram director is minimal and mostly expository, so relationship crucible is light.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for reconnection yet hoarding silence—drives every micro-choice; the glass ink well and manuscript act as embodied stakes. Her “carefully reckless” trait manifests in the midnight sprint to translate the sister-dialogue, costing her physical stamina and emotional armor. The final phone call crystallizes an earned shift: vulnerability chosen over retreat. Only slight over-articulation of “symphony of truth” keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the chain, the thrill of the chase—but the “slyly heartfelt” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the prior beats show calculation, not emotional risk. The micro-choice to read the message aloud crystallizes her arc, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—shame over the grandfather’s fraud vs. reverence for the relic—are embodied in trembling fingers and ledger-flipping. The final choice to hand-carry the chip is earned by the dream and the dust-map epiphany, with visible cost: abandoning the courier identity. Interiority is specific, but the “balance” refrain edges toward label-speak once too often.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s interiority is specific—wood grain under her palm, the logbook’s crackle—but the leap from “cartographer of necessary distances” to decisive crossing of the light-door feels slightly under-cooked; the cost (abandoning the terrace forever) is stated rather than embodied. Her contradictory impulses (longing vs. wariness) flicker but do not fully clash in-scene before the threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her eyes reflecting the dance of light”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the burnt feather is handled twice yet never forces a hard choice, so the final “rhythm of belonging” feels more observed than earned. No genuine flaw complicates her stance, and the cost is diffuse rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “cheerful gloom” is embodied in humming that fades to sighs—but the final epiphany (“paths are released”) arrives more as thematic statement than as earned emotional cost; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s analytical lens is vivid—she maps the arcade as a chessboard and weighs every passerby—but her interiority flattens into strategic abstraction; the bishop piece never complicates her choices, only decorates them. The final silence is a credible renunciation, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirael’s interior contradiction—yearning cosmically yet anchored to the present moment—is embodied in every move she makes, but the line “her heart full of obsidian grace” veers toward label-speak without specific embodiment. The micro-choice to etch the verse onto herself is earned and carries visible pain, meeting Earned Stasis. However, the final beat slips into abstraction, dulling the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara is consistent but thin—glass artisan identity never presses on the stakes; her communion action feels ornamental rather than character-forcing. No interior contradiction or cost; she registers more as placid observer than active lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s survivor-guilt and need for absolution are embodied in the hourglass moment; the scarred face and helmet bite are vivid. Interior contradiction—fear of the box vs need to open it—drives the single decisive choice. Yet the “bargained innocence” concept is asserted more than dramatized in present action, muting the cost scale.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clear, mathematically-minded Elara pivots from observer to proactive experimenter; each micro-choice (tying thread, steadying gauge) embodies her traits. Interiority stays concrete (“logical dreamer”), but contradictory impulses—hope vs. the pull of failure glimpsed in other timelines—remain implied, not dramatized mid-scene. Cost is felt—the glowing thread is literally her silver hair—yet the moment registers more lyrical than visceral, slightly diminishing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. stewardship—surface in the micro-choice to burn the negative; embodied tremor and soot-stained reflection keep interiority concrete. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits the relic to become the map. Minor slip: “legacy’s burden” is named rather than dramatized until the locket beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the slick prism, the locket’s pulse, the sweat of effort—yet her contradictory impulses (hope vs. grief) are stated more than dramatized mid-scene. The final renunciation (walking away depleted) is earned, but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is vivid—contradictory impulses (clipboard as weapon and shield) embodied with tactile clipboard scars. Her gentle authority feels earned, guiding delegates under sun-scorched stone. Final renunciation/reconfiguration is credible, if understated; cost is felt in the ink-stained relic she pockets.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses—sentiment vs destruction—are embodied in the egg ritual and the final resort plan; the cost is the permanent loss of the river and the bird, felt in the vanished egg and the empty vial. Interiority is specific and non-diagnostic. The only cap is that the “next project” coda is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s motivation to defy conformity is declared early and her dance embodies that stance, but interior contradiction is thin; we never feel the cost of chastity or the lure of conformity she rejects. The final “lighter steps” gesture registers as symbolic rather than earned from a specific interior struggle. No secondary pressure or relationship crucible is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—elegant liar seeking redemption—drives every beat; the moment he flips the projection to “make the shadows dance” crystallizes his stance with visible cost. Yet the serenity trait is asserted more than embodied under pressure, and Mara’s presence is too slight to function as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is textured—her trembling hands, the moth-wing relic, the interrupted breathing—but the story stops short of letting contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the final “peace” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority—especially the embodied grief of scarred hands and the single word “Lira” breathed but unspoken—shows contradictory impulses: preservation of silence vs. desperate restoration of lost voices. The rope-reweaving choice crystallizes this conflict with immediate, irreversible cost, earning a credible endurance that forecloses his past mute resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip on the seal, the candle’s tremble—but the “precisely playful” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final integration of foresight/hindsight is earned and carries cost, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s frugality and grief are embodied in tactile choices (bartering wages, gripping the tile), but the mentor’s death is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the interior contradiction. The final covenant with herself lands cleanly, yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s pacifist cunning surfaces only in exposition; her micro-choices under pressure are missing. The visitors’ releases feel externally imposed rather than earned through interior contradiction. No embodied cost is dramatized for her final exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s steady hands and interior contradiction—curiosity vs. fear of dream-loss—are embodied in the glass-etching and mirrored breathing. The stranger remains a cipher, but Elias’s micro-choice to hand over the etched mirror crystallizes his values and costs him a path. The final shift from boundary-erasure to boundary-navigation is earned by prior craft imagery. Yet the stranger’s urgency feels externally imposed, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s stubborn persistence is embodied in every climb and solder; the ribbon’s tactile return in the final pocket crystallizes her maternal drive. Interiority is specific—her scoff at “endearingly feisty,” the hummed tune—yet the emotional contradiction between grief and defiance could be sharper under pressure. The earned cost is legible: she forfeits the ribbon’s daily comfort to weave it into the next eye, sealing the legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s layered interiority is clear—“a hunger that bordered on obsession” shows embodied contradiction—and her choices pivot via the cameo and shell, culminating in Earned Stasis when she fuses the blank to the tree, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive to “rewrite her life’s work” is clear, but the interior contradiction between pride in knowledge and admission of ignorance is stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The embodied cost—pocketing the blue orchid, humming the childhood tune—earns the guardian’s concession, yet the shift feels slightly compressed. Kael remains a plot device rather than relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the garden while fearing its cost—are embodied in her wing brushing the name-flower; the final sewing of their joint name into soil crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Veyra’s skepticism provides relational crucible pressure that shifts to acceptance. Minor slip: “blissfully aberrant” is label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremor in her knees” vs “hands steady”), but the final crystallization of identity (“I’m a weaver of timelines”) is asserted rather than dramatized; the cost of stepping back into the humming room is implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her ribs ache,” “fingers danced”), but the mapkeeper’s contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; the bloom’s conjuring feels inevitable rather than wrestled with. A single micro-choice—pressing the stone to the spiral—drives the climax, yet the cost (loss of ancient hymns) is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s retrocognitive gift and her bleeding fingers give visceral cost; her stubborn hope is embodied in every shard she aligns. The interior contradiction—doubt vs. faith—drives each micro-choice, culminating in the earned stasis of “that was enough.” Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from passive archivist to active participant is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (kneeling, tracing shadows, listening to crystal hum). The final renunciation—choosing lived experience over mere record—carries felt cost. Minor slip: “preemptively nostalgic” is stated more than enacted in body.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the warm knot, the chant, the raw laugh—yet the mentor’s absence is only asserted, not dramatized, so the final renunciation feels slightly pre-loaded rather than fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses (record vs. bridge) act simultaneously in the grotto beats. The final micro-choice—leaving the cicada—earns the soft rapprochement with Kael and carries relational cost. Minor slip: “warmly observant” is asserted more than dramatized in body language.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lila’s yearning for silence-flavors is embodied early through tactile dread of metal quiet, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into visible friction during her ascent; she floats, she clutches, she mourns, yet her micro-choice to let the doll go is under-ritualized—more floated than earned. The growth sprout substitutes for direct fallout from that choice rather than forcing a renunciation or crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara emerges as an individual consciousness: her embodied emotion (tension in shoulders, frozen breath) and real-time micro-choice to tilt the now-still vial show motive under pressure. The interior contradiction—wanting to teach silence comfort while fearing it needs instruction—is dramatized through the storm glass beats, not abstractly asserted. The final renunciation (shifting routes, learning to “let silence lead”) costs her previous plan and is earned on the page. Minor slip: a touch of thematic label-speak (“teach silence how to comfort”) early, but it is embodied before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—spectacles, frost-kissed grass, breath hitching—yet her contradictory impulses (fear vs duty) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final refusal to sit crystallizes her arc with visible cost (stairway collapses), but the moment is compressed to a single sentence, muting the felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—burning bridges yet summoning Kael—are embodied in trembling hands and the tactile cold of the ring; the final hand-clasp shows earned cost, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract “emptiness” labels.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s pyramid-scheme past and “virtuously mischievous” streak are signaled early and motivate her decisive turn of the bolt, but interiority is thin—her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in the moment of choice. The felt cost (loss of certainty, possible collapse) is present yet abstract; a crisper embodiment of fear or regret would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—hunger for truth vs. reverence for ancestral silence—are embodied in the tremor of her hand and the steadiness of the crank. The micro-choice to insert the handle into the secret groove crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs her the comfort of ignorance. Backstory is tightly cued to present action (father’s fevered grip on the crank). Only slight over-articulation of “dynasty ender” as label keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cedric’s silence and trauma are embodied in every micro-choice; the trembling fingers, the throat tightening, the paradoxical shivering bliss all feel lived. Motivation pivots from survival to capture to surrender, each shift rooted in the prior beat. The final renunciation—walking away unarmored, leaving no prints—carries visible cost and is earned by the spiral descent. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; a hair more on-page tension between “capture” and “feel” would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile reading of dust, the stutter of his heart—but the story withholds a decisive choice until the final beat. The “tactfully hopeful” stance is shown only in the act of opening a new folder; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The button triggers memory, yet Elias never tests or risks anything with it; the cost is retrospective, not paid on the page. Still, the specificity of his archival body-language lifts him above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s scrapper backstory and the key-as-promise give her a clear motive, but interiority stays surface-level; the climactic “dive” choice is credible yet lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost beyond generic risk.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to silence the prophecy yet fearing its truth—are embodied in the saxophone’s negative-space playing; the final renunciation costs him lingering doubt, earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete, but the grandmother’s deathbed scene is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly blunting motive intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elinor’s interiority is concrete—calloused hands, mossy delight—but the shift from skeptic to believer happens in a single beat (“until now”) without embodied contradiction. The final resolve is credible yet feels slightly tidy; no lingering flaw complicates her new purpose. Micro-choices (nudging the speck, building monuments) reveal hierarchy of values, but cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—fixing clocks vs. embracing uncertainty—are dramatized in the greenhouse collapse and compass discovery; the final renunciation of perfection is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied; the ache in his bones, the coin’s heat, the throat-tightening all ground motive. The final renunciation—accepting cracks without Lira—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “balanced alchemist” is label-speak before it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart a steady drum”), but the moment of fear-admission feels slightly therapeutic rather than contradictory. The final choice—offering the tooth—earns its cost through prior symbolic logic, yet the keeper’s vanishing leaves the relationship pressure under-developed.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the strap yet seeking mercy—play out in embodied micro-choices (pressing forehead to tree, letting spores burn). The final “I’m bracing” crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the woman’s pressure arrives late, muting relationship crucible impact.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—ink’s taste of rust and salt, memory of the cliff—but contradictory impulses stay off-stage; her choices feel pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Motivation (“honor overlooked histories”) is stated, not embodied in a live dilemma. The final renunciation carries felt cost only by assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s observant nature is embodied through tactile detail and micro-choices (kneeling, brushing dust, pressing ear), but the interior contradiction—why he stays once the ghosts are freed—remains under-dramatized; the final “repair the stories” gesture feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the frost, the hum only she hears—but her contradictory impulses (anchor vs. rupture) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost to her is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“burnished sorrow,” “sharp as regret”), but the shift from revolutionary to archaeologist is asserted rather than dramatized; the shard’s warmth and glow anchor micro-choices, yet the Council remains a faceless backdrop, so status pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—reverence for decay yet duty to “mend”—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (needle through reversed gears). Lira’s confession is credible, but Elias’s own flaw (detached savior) is never tested; the cost is hers, not his, so the arc feels half-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lira’s curiosity about petrichor and her psychometry gift are concrete, and her final renunciation—choosing mystery over explanation—carries felt cost in the lingering hum. Interiority is vivid (“tasted the edge of the unknowable”) but occasionally drifts toward lyrical summary. Sensibly eccentric tag neither constrains nor complicates a key action.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation—turning chaos into legible language—remains consistent, and her shift from sculptor to “weaver of timelines” is earned through the lantern-slide covenant. Interiority is vivid (“turbine-hum reverie that vibrated in her bones”), yet the cost of her new role is only implied, not embodied on the page. The grandmother’s single line of dialogue supplies relational pressure, but the relationship itself is sketched rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s quiet obsession is credibly embodied—brush trembling, palm on glass—but her interiority drifts into summary (“she’d finally understood”) rather than contradiction in scene. The final smile feels unearned; no micro-choice dramatizes the cost of her new knowledge. Secondary characters (Sister Agatha) apply only off-hand pressure, so relationship crucible is minimal. Overall, a solid portrait with minor epiphany drift.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, retrocognitive loops—but her final choice to “buy time” feels under-motivated; the diary’s blank pages hint at cost yet lack embodied consequence. Elara’s ghost supplies pressure, but Mara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs duty) are told more than dramatized in the collapse beat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, hollowed eyes, and fierce refusal of false comfort—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The final “tears mixing with salt spray” crystallizes cost, yet the shift from despair to resolve is more asserted than embodied in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elder Voss’s interiority is textured—his calloused hands, trembling fingers, and Old High Martian murmurs embody motive and memory. The contradiction between archiving detachment and impending awakening is dramatized in the final choice to “listen” rather than intervene, costing him the illusion of control. Micro-choices (winding the phonograph, removing the shaving) track his shifting stance. Only the children remain off-page, so relationship crucible is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lirael’s interiority—especially the “furiously tranquil” paradox—shapes micro-choices under pressure, but the trait is labeled more than dramatized in body language, and her moment of sacrifice is felt more as triumphant release than visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s curiosity is credibly embodied in her tactile testing of ropes and clouds, but the interior contradiction between scientific detachment and emotional investment is only sketched. The final “maestro” accolade feels slightly over-telegraphed, softening the cost of her earned humility.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Zara’s interiority is vivid—her empathy with the star’s death is embodied in the kneel and lantern placement—but her “cosmic janitor” role is ornamental; no tool or duty constrains her choice. The moment of letting-go lands, yet the prior causality is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s astonishment registers only at the start; his interiority remains abstract, never directing a tangible choice. He functions more as passive observer than agent of turns, but the ghost-whispers do prompt his single dramatic act of speech, so the arc pins to that turn [Score hinges on one clear earned beat].

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—banker’s cufflinks, urn fragment against thigh—but the decisive shift from “numbers lost meaning” to “time is a mosaic” is more asserted than dramatized; the urn’s final stilling of mercury supplies embodied cost, yet the emotional contradiction between grief and wonder could be sharper in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical and embodied (bare feet skimming water, tracing feather barbs), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; no moment of genuine struggle complicates her tending. The final renunciation of permanence is credible yet cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—acceptance of mortality vs. refusal to abandon the orchard—drive every micro-choice. The “gentle and systematic” trait constrains her tactics and shows cost when she chooses patience over speed. Final renunciation is earned: she gives her last breath to the orchard, foreclosing any other future.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirael’s skeptical yet obsessive drive is vivid, mirrored in her clutching the amber and the moment she laughs “like breaking glass.” The interior contradiction—yearning to debunk the Enclave yet exposing herself to its pull—pushes the beat at the tower’s base. Kael’s stance toward bottled “homecoming” provides an external hinge, but their on-page confrontation is less a crucible than a guided dialogue; final choice is less decisive confrontation than introspective acceptance. Cost is felt in the chest-ache, though the beat remains more resonant than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the coachman's layered motives (soldier-gardener, grief-hope) surface through micro-choices like crushing bone-ash fertilizer. The final whispered phrase earns a credible renunciation of violence. Yet the single POV never faces a live opposing will, so status dynamics and relational crucible remain untested.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hush’s shift from tracker to translator is embodied in her nose-work and tail-thump, but the interior contradiction (nostalgia vs. present duty) is stated more than dramatized; Jeb remains functional backdrop. The final bark earns communal change yet the cost to Hush herself is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elio’s interiority is vivid—his palm on frosted glass, the “ferment” of ideas, the tremor that smudges ink—yet the grandmother’s apparition is accepted too smoothly, blunting the cost of reunion. The final micro-choice (eyes closed, compass warm) crystallizes his shift from paralysis to trust, but the emotional contradiction between exile and instant acceptance could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—thief’s nerve versus apprentice’s reverence—surface in the tremor of his hand over the king piece, but the interiority flirts with label-speak (“guardian of wonder”) that blurs embodied cost. The final smile feels slightly unearned because the stakes leap from personal risk to cosmic rescue without a visible personal loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—scars ache, eyes hold “quiet weight”—and her contradictory impulses (mimic vs. historian) act simultaneously in scene. The final self-identification as pawn-king-board crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she leaves the gallery carrying the board, path foreclosed to passive observation. Minor slip: “benevolently ruthless” is asserted more than dramatized until the final stride.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet fearing the stone’s memories—are embodied in her nightly substitution of reality and the trembling feather. The final choice to accept obsidian shards into her skin crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Minor: Orin’s pressure is off-stage, so relationship crucible is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alaric’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are embodied in the tactile handling of threads and ring-fidget; the final renunciation of blame is earned through the memory beat and the cost of accepting unchangeable loss. Interior contradiction is present but slightly under-dramatized in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his belief that “truth isn’t a blade but a kaleidoscope” seeds every choice—but the elders remain off-page caricatures, so status pressure is abstract. His embodied climb and brush-stroke act show micro-choice under cost, yet the forgiveness epiphany arrives more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning for certainty while fearing it—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hand on the charm, the deliberate removal of the respirator. The final renunciation (accepting imperfection) is earned by the prior causal chain of failed mending attempts and embodied cost (burning lungs). Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present stance each time it surfaces.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—salt-smudged fingers, the weight of the shell—but the “promise to himself” remains abstract until the final beat; the contradiction between nostalgia and rebellion is shown more than felt in scene. Micro-choice at the pool (placing shell, beginning to draw) crystallizes values, yet the cost is gentle rather than irreversible. Still, the arc from cracked mirror to cavern peace is coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is a persuasive, contradictory mix of scientist and mystic, her quiet rebellion against Thalos and herself embodied in trembling hands and a half-held breath. Interior shifts are earned and visible, but the final epiphany still feels narrated rather than dramatized, nudging the score downward.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s patched-together identity feels tactile—cracked goggles, salt-crusted radio patches; interiority remains concrete without epiphany drift. Obstinate midnight choices (hair-wired antenna, spinning censer foot) reveal a clear value hierarchy of remembrance over safety. Passivity only appears during one brief summary; micro-shifts of attention (phone → build) show earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s rationality is shown through methodical foraging and cautious use of the eye, but interior contradiction is thin; her hope at the end feels more asserted than earned. Jorn’s paranoia supplies external pressure, yet their shared history is only sketched. The glass eye’s cost—loss of conversational control—is implied rather than dramatized in her own speech.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief-driven obsession with borrowed memories is vivid, but the woman’s sudden appearance and instant confession undercut her agency and the relationship crucible. Interiority is strong—his “storm-cloud” eyes and seaweed beard are specific—but the final promise to “return them” feels unearned because we never see the mechanism or cost. The contradictory impulse (carry vs. release) is stated rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid—her heartbeat syncing with water drip, the chip’s weight in pocket—but the father-vision resolves conflict too easily, muting the cost of her choice. Micro-choices (kneeling to watch ants, touching the chip) reveal values, yet the final “smile” feels unearned after such compressed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Queen’s interior conflict is mostly stated: “tired of being a queen who feels nothing,” rather than embodied contradiction; her shift at the end is signalled (“understood”) but left off-stage, softening earned cost. Yet her embodied climb and visceral reaction to pooling starlight keep her particular.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her awe/precision blend is embodied in tactile work with the shell and engine. The “palette of resolve” epiphany is earned by prior failures and Jorin’s mirror pressure. Micro-choice (hand on casing) crystallizes values under risk. Cost is felt in the ringing ears and trembling hands carried forward.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior contradiction—hating past selves while envying their certainty—rings true and is embodied in the trembling hands and hollow laugh. Motivation to “distill chaos into narrative” is stated but never tested in a concrete choice; the climb is driven more by scroll than by present-tense need. Final shift from jealousy to clarity is earned by the ritual, but the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is textured—her synesthetic “phantom scent” and tactile reading of objects—but the decisive act of writing the note feels slightly under-motivated; the emotional cost is implied rather than embodied. The screw’s history is well-evoked, yet Mrs. Voss remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Micro-choices (cleaning the screw, comparing curves) reveal values, but the final beat lacks a visible, felt renunciation or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, itching scars, trembling hands—but the shift from fear to clarity feels slightly front-loaded; the final “lightness” arrives without a preceding beat of embodied contradiction. Mentor’s aphorisms are well-anchored in memory cues, yet the emotional cost of shedding doubt is asserted more than dramatized in the body. Micro-choices (whispering the rhyme, carving the sigil) are specific and character-bound, earning the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “reading Braille” on scores, the bottle’s weight “as if the dove’s wings carried the weight of something unspoken.” Elias’s guilt is embodied in his “eyes two bruises.” The final choice to finish the song imperfectly is earned by prior guilt and Clara’s pressure, but the sister’s voice remains more device than person, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single character arc is elegantly implied, but interiority remains abstract ("thousand lifetimes") and micro-choices are left off-stage rather than dramatized; the final peace reads more stated than earned against specific embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lorn’s interiority is vivid—his ritual of counting backwards, the key’s bite in his palm—but the final epiphany (“clocks measure longing”) arrives more as lyrical assertion than earned contradiction. No micro-choice in the last beat alters his next action; he simply pockets the key and walks inside. The cost is conceptual, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his spatial gift is embodied in the fractal laser test and the conceptual “seeing through” the barrier. The contradiction between control and surrender is dramatized in the micro-choice to tune the laser to Lira’s voice, not data. Cost is felt when he pockets the now-cool pointer, renouncing his old identity. Secondary pressure from Lira is present but thin; her “afraid” line is more label than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—gambler’s itch vs. daughter’s grief—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing lantern, choosing left at fork). The final renunciation to “visit her father” lands with felt cost, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak (“theoretical rebellion”).

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the disc, her “cultivated estrangement” credo—but the story never tests her own estrangement; she remains a benevolent conduit rather than a protagonist whose choices cost her anything. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat shows her risking or forfeiting a personal stake.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but her final “realization” is more stated than dramatized; the locket and ink ritual carry ancestral weight yet the cost of her choice remains abstract. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to force a visible renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “elusive” trait is shown through his vanishing act and moon-rock debt, but the interior contradiction between jocularity and desperation is only sketched; the final grin feels more reported than earned. Lira’s pressure is clear, yet her own stakes remain off-page, muting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s loss-anchored drive is clear (“late at night Elias vowed to reach the end”), but some interior turns lapse into label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. His late-arriving mother as a “memory made flesh” feels emotionally potent yet slightly under-earned—more vision than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt and “confidently uncertain” mantra are embodied in micro-choices (pocketing the warmed pen, quickening pace). Interior contradiction—fixer vs listener—drives the final renunciation. Lira’s presence forces status shift and crystallizes the cost of letting go. Flaw (hubris) compounds until Elias accepts collaborative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is embodied (camera against chest, hands conducting silence) and his motivation—translate silence into music—drives every micro-choice. The contradiction between his desire to disrupt forgetfulness and his fear that “the joy…would fade” surfaces late but is felt. Lira’s presence supplies relational pressure that forces Kael to externalize his gift, altering both their states. Cost is visible: Kael’s smile is “rare,” and dawn leaves him “alone again,” the silence re-ascendant.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—destruction as rescue—are embodied in tactile choices (ink, fire, tear) and crystallize in the final renunciation of “arsonist” for “gardener.” The grandmother promise supplies motive, but the on-page cost is the acid-burned portrait reforming into the grandmother’s face, a visible forfeiture of anonymity. Interiority is specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. The flaw of trespass is accepted, not balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s interiority is vivid—scars “pulse faintly beneath his coat”—and his quiet rebellion is embodied in the drumming. The shared-memory entanglement with the woman is credible, but her sudden appearance and instant exposition (“The lagoon’s memories aren’t just echoes—they’re alive”) undercuts the earned cost of his final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s fear-versus-curiosity contradiction is embodied in trembling hands and the coin’s burn; his whisper-theory motive is dramatized through the tactical silence that wins the challenge. The final refusal to shout directions crystallizes an earned stance with visible social cost. Yet interiority occasionally drifts into thematic summary (“whispers travel farther than shouts”) rather than moment-to-moment sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s interiority stays largely poetic label—“spiralingly calm”, “shadow without a voice”—and never collides with contradictory impulse; the lone micro-choice (tilting shutters) doesn’t visibly trade against her attribute, so the ending reads as tableau continuation, not earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s grief-driven coaching and empathic gift are credibly embodied; her micro-choice to reveal Lila’s father history tilts the girl’s stance. Lila’s shift from isolation to “I’m learning” is legible, though her interiority is mostly reported. Cost is present but diffuse—no single forfeiture crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s embodied fear and inherited dream are vivid; the scrimshaw’s warmth and her final laughter-through-tears crystallize the arc. Yet the father’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the generational weight that should drive her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s blank mask and ritual carving create a credible contradiction—she performs indifference while preserving memory. Interiority is embodied in tactile micro-choices (crumbling petal, tracing grain). The final renunciation—“I will carve another”—earns its cost by foreclosing open grief under mandate threat. Motive remains consistent, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the “tremor of certainty” is felt more as atmosphere than as a specific internal conflict that forces a costly choice. The final step onto liquid glass is a clear renunciation of prior limits, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s color-blindness and obsession with imperfection drive every choice; the final painting crystallizes his arc. Marla’s backstory flashback is brief but sufficient to reweight her motives. Interiority is embodied (throbbing head, moth on finger) and avoids label-speak. The cost—accepting flawed beauty—lands with earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile curiosity about texture, the embodied shiver when the cave sings—but her contradictory impulses (stay safe vs. quest) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (“We keep questioning”) carries conceptual cost yet feels slightly abstract; the emotional price is hinted, not felt on the skin.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s atonement and interior contradiction read as concrete; his embodied grief (“his fingers bled”) and micro-choice to burn the night into light show character under pressure. Motive intensifies directly into the lantern-lit ritual. Cost is palpable: bleeding fingers, emptied pockets, acceptance of never fully repairing what is “unbroken.” The Earned Stasis — choosing continued atonement via pendant — lands with sufficient emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and cartomancer identity are embodied through tactile micro-choices—measuring grief’s angles, laying cards in raindrops—yet her interior contradiction (analyst turned mystic) is asserted more than dramatized. The final “this is how we rebuild” lands as thematic statement rather than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s contradictory hunger for forbidden knowledge versus her vow to “avoid patterns” is embodied in trembling hands and deliberate palm-to-pagoda contact; the final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost as she walks deeper into the unknown, veil fluttering. Kael’s fear is palpable but remains a foil rather than a crucible, limiting relationship depth.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her deliberate pause to withhold the council, her embodied grip on the stone—but the “softly deliberate” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to speak “Bloom” feels inevitable yet the cost is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling hands, the cold glass, the remembered laughter of the handlers. The contradiction between clinging to softness and needing to shed vulnerability is dramatized in the act of reconstruction. The final smile is earned because the tail’s completion visibly costs her the illusion that gentleness alone suffices. One notch below 9.0 only because the handlers remain off-stage voices rather than embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—seeking closure yet fearing memory—are embodied in the scar’s ache and the trembling hand. Micro-choices (touching the hourglass, descending the tunnel) align with motive and escalate cost. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she accepts the scar as bridge, not map. Interiority stays concrete, though “raw and hyperaware” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and lens-gazer specific; her empathic reading cascades into mid-scene turns that narrow choice (film break, letters). Renunciation is earned as she relinquishes the safe curator role for empathy curator, with visible rumpled film as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning to create yet fearing the loss of his visions—drives every beat; the embodied tremor when he lifts the jar and the raw laugh at the end show earned cost. Motivation intensifies from vague chase to concrete ingestion of “Dreamer’s Unspoken Truth,” foreclosing retreat. Minor slip: “trapped creativity” edges toward label-speak, but the dramatized stakes override it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s dreamlessness and freight-guard role anchor early beats; his interiority is thin but the “ache of absence” at the archive gives a felt pivot. The final dream arrives as earned reconfiguration rather than epiphany, yet prior micro-choices are more observed than enacted. Relationship with the woman remains spectral, so status pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's interior journey is clearly anchored by her longing for her father and the need to reclaim her mental wildness, embodied through the hum she internalizes. The choice to release the gear gives up her only link to dad, producing felt cost. Interiority stays sensorily grounded; no therapy-speak breaks. A tighter beat where translocation imposes immediate crisis could lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s calm authority and Jorin’s apprentice anxiety are cleanly embodied; the punch’s inheritance and Lira’s lullaby-voice give concrete specificity. Interior contradiction is light—Jorin’s fear is voiced but never collides with another desire in-scene—so the final “choice” to wait feels more inherited than personally earned. Still, the mentor/apprentice status shift is legible and the cost of endless vigil is implied in their dawn stance.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elric’s interiority is specific—his memorized bolt angle, the weight of silence as contract—but the “seraphically mundane” trait stays label-level until the final line; the contradiction between silence and speech is dramatized in scene, and the cost of breaking it is embodied when the bench steadies and the snow seems to melt. Motivation pivots from abstract to visceral via Lady Veyra’s scream, earning the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Veyra’s internal contradiction—her noble pedigree framed by unpretentious action—is conveyed via micro-choices like “pressing the pellet into recess,” not labels. Motive-to-action linkage is coherent; the only gap is the jump from map discovery to trapdoor access in a compressed beat. Embodied cost arrives when the realm sees its heir’s unadorned hand, not the crown. The regal/unpretentious dialectic is active, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s tapping rhythm gives her a tactile, embodied signature, but interiority drifts into summary (“she knew better”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; Kael’s skepticism supplies external pressure yet their joint decision to sail lacks visible cost on the page, muting the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s barefoot stargazer identity is vivid—calloused feet, opera glasses, grandmother’s charts—yet her “awkward confidence” is asserted more than embodied; the final stance crystallizes but the cost is collective rather than personal, softening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nana Marisol’s insurgent past and plant-telepathy are sketched vividly and anchored in micro-choices (kneeling to trace symbols, blistering hands). The final planting of the embryo crystallizes her arc—tradition evolved, not abandoned—with felt cost in the glowing soil. Interiority is specific, though the “accidental telepathy” label edges toward convenient shorthand rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the deliberate “freeze” of peace—are embodied in trembling hands and the stone bench; the final micro-choice to tuck the photo back without flinching earns the closure with visible cost. Mrs. Voss functions as pressure, not ornament, forcing Lila to articulate the stake aloud. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the body remembers through salt, lavender, cold rock. Motivation scales cleanly from seeking stillness to anchoring hope in realism.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his hatred of tarot, the grandmother’s loom memory—but the portrait client’s vanishing is asserted, not dramatized, so the inciting wound feels off-page. The final smile is earned by the thread-work, yet the cost (abandoning prior art) is implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation—finding her erased brother—is clear and visceral; her anger is embodied (“quiet fire that burned through restraint”) and shapes micro-choices (spilling ink, defying elders). Interiority wobbles only once when “consciously wild intuition” is declared rather than shown, but contradiction and embodied cost remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s interior contradiction—archive loyalty vs. truth—drives the single decisive act of reviving Kael, but the shift from observer to rebel is asserted more than dramatized; we feel her trembling yet never see the specific micro-choice that tips her. Kael’s awakening supplies minimal relationship pressure, so the crucible is internal only. The cost (Council retaliation) is named, not embodied. Still, traits are consistent and embodied emotion is present.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—daughter of violence turned curator of stillness—powers every micro-choice (burying the ballast, re-purposing the knife). Embodied emotion and sanctuary-forging agency are vivid, and the final re-naming of “quiet” constitutes Earned Stasis with clear cost. However, the one-note absence of an on-page secondary character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s cool-headed detachment and competence feel consistent; his final kneel-and-smile suggests Earned Stasis after a credible on-page trade (goddess lost → sky stilled). Yet interiority after the spectral touch leans toward lyrical summary rather than embodied emotion, blunting the fuller 9.0+ claim.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clara's contradictory impulses in wanting both legacy and truth create a credible turn; however, her interior monologue tilts into generic "therapy-speak" twice, blunting specificity. The final renunciation carries real cost but is soft-landed by familial apology rather than irrevocable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her breath hitching at the firmware’s baby-cry revelation—but the mother-daughter guilt thread is delivered in exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The final forgiveness beat is emotionally credible yet compressed; we feel cost but not the full weight of her prior avoidance. Secondary characters (Elara, Dr. Althea) serve as mouthpieces more than crucibles, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara feels individual and arc-worthy—her shift from observer to active translator is subtle yet earned through embodied micro-choices (tracing, pressing, white-chalking the wall). Interiority is mood-rich though it flirts with “mantra” self-awareness as shorthand for struggle. The reconfiguration at the end crystallizes motive with visible forfeiture of detachment and rings cost inside the sculpted silence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—steel arms cradling mercy—drives every micro-choice; the tessera placement is a credible renunciation that costs him the comfort of pure grief. Retrocognition is embodied, not labeled, and the artisan’s memory tilts his present stance. Flaw: the “gentle radical” tag is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly blunting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s synesthetic interiority is vivid and embodied; his desire to “lure possibility from the brink” is dramatized through humming, coin-pressing, and the final dance. The flapper woman’s arrival supplies relational pressure, but her agency is thin—she mainly mirrors Elias. The earned stasis (Elias fades after mending time) carries felt cost, yet the interior contradiction between encore-thrill and self-erasure could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s refusal-cum-quest is rooted in somatic injury; his interior contradiction ("affectionate skeptic" mistrusts pills yet longs for connection) stays in bodily registers. Geode and shock provide embodied, irreducible cues that drive micro-choices—each sketch, trace, flare—until the shared, low-whisper “Then let’s show the world” crystallizes relationship cost under the studio neon.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between scientific detachment and empathic surrender is dramatized in the moment she lets the spores enter her skin. Motive (“become the voice of the unknown”) is stated early and re-energized by the fossil’s dissolution, but the final resolve feels slightly abstract—no concrete next action or renounced alternative is shown, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s desire to “spin a prophecy into raw possibility” is stated early and revisited in the final image, but her interiority stays largely abstract; the button-sorting ritual shows quiet inspiration yet lacks a contradictory impulse or visible cost that would sharpen the final stance. The shift from passive listening to active cataloging is credible, but the emotional stakes feel muted because no personal flaw or fear is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—gloved hands, burned-spy reflex, pillbox weight—but the “unused courage” epiphany is stated rather than dramatized mid-scene; her final smile feels slightly unearned because the contradictory impulse (paranoia vs. trust) is only summarized, not enacted in a visible micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Thaddeus’s interiority is atmospheric but diffuse; the yarn needle and “distill complexity” remain abstract labels rather than embodied stakes. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the final silence feels like continuation, not earned renunciation. The ferryman is present but exerts no pressure that forces a choice, keeping relationship status static.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—calloused hands, still-water mind—and her micro-choice to place the lantern among the sunflowers crystallizes her shift from observer to caretaker of memory. The younger-self vision supplies a credible contradiction that justifies her departure with the warm glass. Cost is felt: she relinquishes the oasis’s shelter to carry its lesson forward.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s desire to “reflect light” stays anchored in tactile micro-choices: coaxing jasmine, tapping the gauge cadence into the dock planks, pushing open Mara’s shutter. Interiority stays embodied—salt smell, metal chill—not label-speak. The final stance crystallizes at cost: the gardener accepts remaining a tender outsider, visible when Mara closes her eyes but does not yet smile. All interior conflict is enacted, never summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her fingertip on the sundial, her whispered “I see you, but I am not you”—but the shift from isolation to independence is more asserted than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene to show the brittleness of that awakening. The final choice to write is credible yet feels lightly earned, lacking a visible cost that would foreclose an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid—her hollow chest, trembling hand—but the epiphany (“now, she understood”) is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost. The micro-choice to place her secret in the orb is clear, yet the final resolve to “write a letter of her own” is off-page, softening the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lila’s interior conflict—hope colliding with the knowledge that these entities are older than time—is concrete ("her chest tight with relief") and recurs under rising pressure. Her micro-choice to dam the river ("Then I’ll dam it") crystallizes an end-of-round stance with visible endurance cost. Her cautious hope never flips into naïveté; flaws persist under the final taunt. Dialogue with Hale could be sharper, but it is secondary pressure, not relationship crucible; still, it pushes Lila to declare her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is embodied early and flares under pressure, but the interior contradiction between fear and resolve is asserted more than dramatized in the moment of choice; the final step through the gateway feels earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s face-blindness and methodical empathy are dramatized through tactile sketching and the ribbon’s weight in her pocket; the final micro-choice to frame ribbon beside portrait crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Voss’s weariness supplies relational pressure that forces her to defend her method aloud, tightening their shared stake. Interiority stays embodied and specific, avoiding label-speak. Only the “awaken dormant empathy” line edges toward thesis, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—idealism vs. fear—surface in the tremor of her hands and the pocketed nail, but the interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she knew this: some truths were worth the risk”). The ancestor’s motivation is vivid, yet Clara’s final leap feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is declared more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his noticing of “wind curled around the pine boughs” and the flake’s “heartbeat trapped in glass” grounds his obsession. Yet the pivot from passive recounting to active choice (“ready to play…one more time”) is asserted rather than dramatized; we feel the cost conceptually, not viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied, but the “polished calm” never cracks under pressure; we’re told it’s tested yet see no embodied contradiction. The final renunciation is earned, yet the cost feels light because the startup founders remain off-stage abstractions. The foreign bills work as a charged object, but their emotional weight is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her breath fogging equations, the prism warming her palm—yet the brother’s vanishing is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the personal stake. The final surrender to shared grief is embodied and costly, earning the shift from observer to bearer.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s bark-rough interiority is vivid, and her memory fracture under vortex pressure catalyzes the final confession; suppression-amnesia feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—“her fingers tracing the veins” and scars that “ached now, as if summoned”—but the golden-eyed double speaks in abstract thesis (“fear is a mirror”) that blurs embodied contradiction. The final choice to press the clipping to her heart is earned by prior scar-link mechanics, yet the cost (vanished scars, twin moons) feels externally bestowed rather than wrested from flaw. Still, her micro-choice hierarchy is legible and stakes scale to length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—reckless forward motion vs. need for gentleness—are dramatized in the sewing scene; the micro-choice to pierce bone and stitch regret is embodied, costly, and specific. Interiority avoids label-speak, using tactile detail (“knees sinking into soft earth”) to externalize shame. The earned shift from certainty to doubt is credible and scaled to the word count. Minor slip: “patch the holes in her soul” edges toward therapeutic shorthand, though it is immediately grounded in the sewing action.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lenny’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. emotional insulation—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the cloth and the phone call; the final choice to “resurrect forgotten stories” is credibly foreshadowed and costs him his safe detachment. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat of diagnostic self-labeling (“confidently uncertain”) slips into abstraction rather than embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her boots clicking against the magnetic lattice”), but the “kindly methodical” trait is asserted more than dramatized; her final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of reconnection is only implied. The seed’s transformation is the only beat where her contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) could have collided on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Librarian and visitor embody the migrating identity theme via concrete choices—entering the creel, accepting feather tokens—yet their internal contradictions are stated more than dramatized; fear-to-feather lacks visceral cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority (“Elias adjusted...respirator... boots crunching”) anchors profession and mood, but we receive only one fraught decision—placing the pearl—with no external contradiction or visible, felt cost on Elias as person, only as conduit. No micro-choices between conflicting motives are dramatized; the characterization trends archetypal “wounded inspector” rather than individuated under pressure. Meets baseline contradiction requirement via wistful regret vs. mission but sustains it via exposition rather than scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—methodical mapper vs. self-lacerating seeker—is embodied in micro-choices (touching brick, kneeling to play). The final “Begin” is earned by prior beats: she re-maps her heart, pays the cost of raw exposure, and forecloses the medicated numbness. Flawed competence balanced with struggle; no safety-hedging. One slip: “raw solace” edges therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lira’s motives—discovery and vindicated theft—are explicit, but her interiority is often abstract (“cautious exuberance” reads reportorial). Backward-moving watch felt as curiosity rather than cost, and interior contradiction stays summary rather than live contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling coffee pour, the mulberry ache—yet her final choice to “dismantle the dream” feels less an earned consequence than a lyrical surrender; the psychic plant link and violin history stay ornamental rather than shaping tactics. No rival character appears; relationships-as-crucible is therefore moot. Contradictory impulses are stated but not staged in real time; the decision registers as abstraction rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, synchronized breath, and exhaustion all embody stakes. The contradiction between her embalmer’s precision and artist’s intuition surfaces in the embellishment gamble, forcing a visible cost (cracks seal only after she risks the grotto). Motivation stays rooted: preserve Elion’s echo or lose it. The final slump and smile crystallize earned stasis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s forgiveness is embodied in her trembling hand and cautious descent; Elara’s return and gift feel earned by prior guilt. Interiority is concrete (“vineyard hush of stillness” as felt silence). Yet the caretaker role is asserted more than dramatized—no beat shows her tending the grotto. Micro-choice of pinning the hairpin crystallizes the relationship shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—salt-stained stone, the shard’s hum—but the shift from hired skeptic to vulnerable guide is asserted more than dramatized; Mira’s pressure is present yet muted, so the cost feels moderate rather than crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to share knowledge yet compelled to withhold—are embodied in her tactile rituals and silences; Lira’s arrival forces a micro-choice that crystallizes the mentor-student crucible and forecloses the path of direct instruction, the cost legible in Elara’s deliberate silence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—arrowhead’s warmth, bird-pattern epiphany—but the shift from “decades of failure” to instant comprehension feels under-motivated; no embodied contradiction is dramatized mid-scene. The final renunciation (descending the tower) is credible yet the cost is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his self-doubt, tactile awe, and final tear-tracked smile all land—but the “underachieving” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no spell actually misfires on the page. The garden sketch choice is earned and costly, yet the shift from failure to deserving mage feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—duty to the lamps vs. the buried vow—are embodied in the brass key and the cold water; the final renunciation of the key on the desk earns the closure with visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the embodied grief (“stain on his ears”) grounds the metaphysical quest. Micro-choice of placing the key crystallizes the arc without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s quiet enthusiasm is embodied in tactile coin-handling and sensor-sync micro-choices; the interior contradiction (skepticism vs. wonder) is present but thin, and the final alignment feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned through visible flaw-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief over Lira is palpable, but the interior contradiction—his need to name fears versus the warnings not to—never quite collides in a single, embodied beat. The final whispered line “Fear. And names.” gestures at cost yet feels slightly external, not wrenched from his body. Still, the micro-choice to speak the phrase that dissolves the monsters is legible and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s earnestly naive fixation on the bell drives every beat, yet his interiority sits a hair too literal; emotional specificity is present but occasionally generalized, tempering the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s vigilance and inherited guilt are embodied in tactile beats (label, photos); her shift from hoarding to sharing memory is earned, though the daughter’s entrance feels slightly expository rather than crucible-level pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—logic vs intuition—drives every beat; the hand-in-flame choice crystallizes it with embodied cost. Sentimentality is dramatized when she pockets the footprint, sealing the arc. Minor slip: “the touch of wonder” is named rather than fully dramatized mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is embodied and specific—muscle memory of his mother’s hands, the cold buckle, the tremor of bark. The contradiction between inherited duty and personal loss is dramatized in micro-choices (pressing the buckle, reforging the node). The final smile carries earned cost: he accepts perpetual vigilance, foreclosing escape. Only the mother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for feeling yet fearing it—are dramatized in the duel; the final merge costs him the clone-self and reawakens pain, earning the change. Interiority is specific (“raw but real”), though a few phrases edge toward label-speak (“emotional numbness”). Micro-choices (slamming palm, cradling the jar) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity and craft ethos are vivid, but the interior contradiction—his drive to innovate versus the seed’s uncanny pull—never collides in a single, embodied beat; the final laugh feels lightly earned rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlowe’s grief-rooted motive is clear and embodied; his trembling grip and blistered palm show cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “mournfully eager” label is repeated rather than dramatized in fresh ways. The final collapse and tears earn the change, yet the arc flirts with sentimental shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—guardianship vs homesickness—are embodied in the pendant burn and the deliberate toss; her interiority is specific, not label-speak. The final renunciation carries visible cost (loss of the cultist’s trust, entry into uncertain library) and is foreshadowed by mentor’s note. Relationship with cultist is thin but sufficient for single-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael interiority is vivid—the cracked crozier as grotesque question mark is a character-specific hook, and his compulsion to absorb failure feels lived. The final decision to pour his own essence into the crosspiece earns the earned-stasis closure; the wound-scarred hands and frayed mind are visible cost. One stock phrase – “like a sponge soaking up poison” – drags the score down 0.3. Relationship/status bullets do not apply; Veyra’s death and ghost voice function as backstory anchor rather than on-page relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his mantra “Discard assumptions” is embodied in the dismantling of the console—but the shift from observer to transformer feels slightly under-motivated; the cost (burned palm) is present yet not deeply tied to an internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s resilient optimism is embodied in micro-choices—tightening grip on the railing, steadying his voice on the radio—until the final renunciation when he accepts erasure as ferry-keeper. Interiority stays concrete; the tear-streaked smile crystallizes cost without sentimentality. One slip: “resiliently positive grin faltered” edges toward label-speak mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory need to lose and find herself is embodied in the act of weaving—but the curator remains a cipher whose pressure is asserted rather than dramatized, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is textured and embodied; the rusted chain link anchors her contradictory need for both stability and expansion. The final beat crystallizes her stance—teaching others to embrace the unknown while still holding the anchor—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s curiosity is embodied in her tactile handling of the photograph and hearing aid, but her interiority drifts toward generic “midwife to grief” labels; the final smile is earned yet feels slightly under-costed because no prior flaw or contradiction is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s claustrophobia is embodied (shallow breaths, walls pressing) and directly conflicts with her drive to descend; the gold-fleck choice to slap it onto the terminal while water rises is a credible, costly micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values—proof over safety. The brother-motivation is cleanly threaded through present action rather than backstory dump. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is textured—heartbeat-counting as embodied rebellion against a database glitch—but contradictions (alive vs officially dead) are asserted more than dramatized in scene. Micro-choices lean toward passive witnessing (watching ink, listening to AI) rather than active gambits that cost him anything until the final shrug toward living. The final stance feels consistent with his compulsive ritual, yet the woman remains a cipher and the promised “wisdom extracted from failure” is more abstract than applied. Good spine, but interior tension doesn’t tighten the noose in proportion with external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (tracing cracks, humming geometry). Motivation is clear and intensifies: from recording birds to risking oblivion. The final renunciation (“I am the extinction”) earns the cost of surrendering the diamond. Minor slip: “quietly articulate” is label-only, never tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her gloved fingers brushing moss-caked roots”), but her decisive shift from observer to participant is compressed into a single beat; the cost of renouncing her above-ground life is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping the change credible yet not fully earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling moth-wing hands, the shell pressed to her chest—but the final “understanding” is articulated rather than dramatized, softening the cost. Motivation is clear and consistent; the micro-choice to blow the shell like a flute crystallizes her stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs smuggling, hope vs fatalism—co-exist in the choice to send the storm and then absorb its fallout. Interiority is embodied (strap biting shoulder, cold bottle) but lapses into epiphany in the final paragraph ("healing in small rebellious acts"). The arc from dutiful carrier to clandestine courier to witness of altered silence is credible, yet the cost—absence of retaliation or personal loss—feels understated, thinning the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elio’s interiority is vivid—his tactile search for the halo fragment and wordless song embody his “quietly persistent” trait. Yet the shift from artifact-hunt to mystical renewal feels slightly under-motivated; the cost of singing (loss of the fragment’s power?) is implied rather than dramatized. Still, his embodied contradictions (silence vs. song, loss vs. possibility) register on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory of the scarf and her restlessness feel embodied—but the decisive shift into the mirrored corridor is under-motivated; the “key” realization arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The final choice to “continue” is credible, yet the cost is only gestured at.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative—“ink-stained and precise,” “salt on her skin”—but the moment of recognition (“I’ve been chasing you”) arrives as pure epiphany rather than embodied contradiction; the cost of renunciation (empty palette, full heart) is felt yet not dramatized through micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior struggle and contradictory desire to betray trust and liberate the trapped idea are embodied through trembling fingers, heart-racing, and the final acceptance of burden. The motivation to “free an idea trapped behind fear” is clear and rooted in Elias's quiet boldness; the cost of that betrayal (dislocation, cosmic vertigo) lands as a felt consequence. Flaw arises in the abstract summary of the woman’s voice after the transformation—therapy-tinged exposition dulls the embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—knees aching, hands trembling—but the interior contradiction between skepticism and belief is summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to stay and wait is credible, yet the cost feels more asserted (“weight of the locket eased”) than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—guardian duty vs. exile reversal—surface in her backward retreat and tea-leaf scrutiny, but the interiority drifts into exposition (“reversible exile was the core concept…”) rather than embodied tension. The mentoring motive is declared, not dramatized until the final exchange, so the cost feels announced rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. risk the seed) play out in micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting the blossom in place of the seed—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “insatiably creative” is asserted rather than dramatized in every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“salt and memory,” “frayed edges”—but her contradictory impulses (fear vs. compulsion to listen) are stated more than dramatized. The final shift to lucid wakefulness is credible yet feels slightly under-costed; we see the weight lift but not what she forfeits. Elias functions as oracle more than crucible, so status pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his fingertip on the torn map, the chill in his bones—and his curiosity is embodied in the brass sextant and stolen holy water. The final choice to listen rather than claim mastery is earned by the escalating hum and the visible shudder of the stones. Yet the grandfather’s journal functions more as prompt than crucible, and Elias’s flaws remain largely off-stage, keeping the arc from full contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief and scientific drive are palpable, but the interior contradiction between clinging and letting go is stated more than dramatized; the final choice to “feel the resonance” is earned yet abstract, lacking embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the trembling plate and charcoal smoke—but the “ghost in code” remains abstract, so the final renunciation (“For you”) feels lightly earned rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “warmly inquisitive nature prickling” is embodied, not labeled—but the final hand-to-chest beat feels slightly unearned because the widow’s grief has been kept at arm’s length; the cost is legible yet not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs. emotional longing—are embodied in the brass telescope and journal, but the “spooled wholeness” belief is asserted more than dramatized. Her final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“But it’ll change me”), yet the interior contradiction between meteorologist and mystic remains under-exploited. Voss functions only as foil; no status shift occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s face-blindness is evoked through texture and hue, but never tested under pressure; her final act feels inevitable yet the interior contradiction (artist who cannot see faces must paint memory) remains ornamental. The safe’s weight and the coin’s indentations give her two tactile choices, but the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied. Earned stasis is present—she walks away carrying the legacy—but the flaw of “limits overcome” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s curiosity is clear and embodied, but the interior contradiction is thin; her leap feels sudden because the stakes between personal risk and discovery aren’t dramatized in scene. Jax offers minimal relational pressure. The earned cost is asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is textured—glove-cold, mirror-doubt, father-oil memory—but the “rhythm of repair” motivation is stated more than embodied; the final choice to take the gears is inevitable, not crucible-tested, so the cost feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s altruism is consistent but abstract; her interiority is filtered through exposition rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a flaw or hidden motive, so the final stance feels pre-ordained. The settlers’ shift from skepticism to unity is summarized rather than dramatized through relationship crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused hands, salt-and-decay air, the tremor in her voice—yet the final renunciation (accepting her flaws while singing) is earned and costly. The grandfather’s memory is woven through micro-choices rather than exposition, and the broken puppet head functions as both heirloom and map. A hairline slip: “doubt that gnawed at her” edges toward label-speak, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vivid—“boots crunching on frost-tipped gravel,” “reluctant caretaker” embodied. Hatred for birds and the curse show competing loyalties, but traveler crisis triggers visible choice. Ending cost (seal door, endure curse) earned yet traveler remains off-stage; emotional charge slightly muffled. Voice, interior thought, and physical stakes align under single POV without drift; minor passivity in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her polymer-chemist lens feels lived-in—but the shift from grief paralysis to “on my way” arrives via text message rather than an on-page micro-choice, blunting the cost of reconnection. The sister relationship is sketched more than crucible-tested; their final duet reads as gentle détente rather than a choice that forecloses retreat. Still, the embodied grief and scientific metaphor cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive—locating narrative origin in absence—remains consistent and embodied through tactile jar-handling; the final micro-choice to release the returning glimmer shows credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers tracing,” “heart light”) and avoids label-speak. Yet the stranger’s pressure is brief, so her interior contradiction never peaks under sustained stress; the earned shift feels gentle rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Nessar’s contradictory impulse—wanting to blunt remorse yet risking deeper entanglement—drives every beat; the moment he tastes the founder’s guilt and chooses to dilute rather than hoard it crystallizes his arc with visible cost (numb fingers, altered gait). Interiority is sensorial and specific (“taste of salt and iron”), never diagnostic. The final renunciation—cooking as humble balm—earns its quietness because the prior beat proved the burden remains. Only minor slip: the guard’s retreat feels slightly convenient, blunting status tension.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her multilingual lullabies to the brass weight reveal contradictory impulses of caretaker and engineer—but the “empathetically decisive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no single micro-choice visibly costs her anything until the final communal moment, which feels gifted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s fractal mindset and archeologist-of-dreams motive are embodied in tactile soldering and laser etching; the final smile and racing heart crystallize earned cost. Interiority stays concrete, but “chaotically precise” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interior kaleidoscope is vivid, yet she remains too competent under pressure; emotional specificity peaks when the chamber shudders, but the flaw struggle feels mild. Micro-choice at the gravity flip earns the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s refusal-to-surrender motive is embodied in her bleeding nails and aching shoulders; the micro-choice to keep strumming despite the cost earns the final silence-shattering chord. Interiority stays sensory and concrete, never lapsing into therapy-speak. The hedgehog’s return as silent witness subtly reinforces her solitude without exposition. A minor slip: the “symphonically minded” label is stated rather than dramatized in one early beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alaric’s exile and chess-as-cosmic-balance obsession are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the final planting of the star-seed crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the late appearance of Lira’s key feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is textured and embodied; her humming to tune the lock is a micro-choice that reveals her pacifist patience. The contradiction between her need to “catalog silence” and the diary’s demand for resonance is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation—carrying silence forward as bridge, not wall—earns its cost through prior beats. Minor slip: “eclectic pacifist” is label-speak once, but the embodied choices override it.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory gift and patient ambition are embodied in soil-tuning and scent-tracking—but the elders’ opposition is off-stage, so status pressure is muted. The final renunciation of haste is earned, yet the cost (lost weeks, social skepticism) is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s curiosity and protectiveness are embodied through tactile micro-choices—dipping into a water sphere, pressing the arrow tip—but interiority stays surface-level; the final renunciation (“guard the gathering”) is credible yet feels lightly earned because the prior cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Anya’s contradictory impulses—methodical documentation vs. visceral dread—are embodied in micro-choices (adjusting sensors, pocketing the patch). The final renunciation of the port’s “machine” is earned, but the engineer’s flatness and the patch’s late agency dilute relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s synesthetic gift and resolve are vivid, but her interior contradiction—fear that wonder might fail—remains asserted rather than embodied in a risky micro-choice. The moment she presses the amber sheet to her lips is intimate, yet the cost of that act (resin taste as possible last breath) is under-dramatized. Relationship crucible with Veyra is thin; his shift from skeptic to believer happens off-stage. Still, her final smile carries earned fatigue, hinting at irreversible expenditure of self.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, throat tightening, hands shaking—yet the “harvest insights from failure” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final driftwood rune. The mentor’s spectral return supplies relational pressure, but the mentor’s cryptic riddle edges toward label-speak. The earned renunciation (broken flute, new rune) carries visible cost and forecloses the old quest, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—detachment vs. the need to feel—are dramatized through the press experiment; the embodied cost (tears, stumbling) earns the final renunciation. The borrowed-personality trait pressures one decisive beat (confusing the fragment) and then collapses, a credible arc. Veyra’s loneliness refracts through Elias’s sudden empathy, altering their relationship state. The flaw of treating emotion as formula drives the mistake and its visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kail’s jittery courier persona is sketched through sensory cues (strap-adjusting, breath-misting) and micro-choices (kneeling to plant), but the interior contradiction between fear and curiosity remains stated rather than embodied; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of accepting mentorship-via-absence is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for proof yet fearing self-deception—is embodied in the tightening grip on the prism and the bitter laugh at the end. Micro-choices (pressing palm to frost, stepping into the arbor) reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of the prism as a tool of discovery carries visible emotional cost and is earned by the preceding cascade of mirrored memories. Flawed ambition is credibly confronted without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused fingers, warmth of amber, loom’s creak—yet her contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation is foreshadowed and carries visible cost (loss of bead, loom stilled), satisfying the Earned Stasis test. Minor slip: “wistful hope” is label-speak that could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jorin’s quiet resolve is embodied through deliberate micro-choices (folding the silk, choosing the center tunnel, enduring the shards). The final endurance scene crystallizes his value hierarchy—resilience over safety—at visible cost (blood, silence). Interiority stays concrete; no stock epiphanies. The only gap: Old Mara’s warning is summary, not on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth vs. fear of its cost—are embodied in the shard’s throb and his trembling hands. The final renunciation feels earned because the shard has steadily overridden his caution. Interiority is concrete: “the weight of the withheld truth crashed over him.” Minor slip: the parallel-universe mother is sketched more as emblem than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s reticence and embodied watchfulness are vivid; the shift from dismissive skepticism to anticipatory caretaking of the stone-stack ritual is credible and felt. Interior contradiction—gruff silence vs. covert hope—plays in real time. The final smile is earned because the ritual has visibly replaced the lamp as his source of duty. Cost is present: he accepts permanent vigilance without mechanical light.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    The Herald’s role is vivid, her laughter visceral, interiority rich, and the final choice to guide the “new dawn” is embodied in her stance against the wind; however, the cost is implicit—“alone on the cliff”—and lacks a tangible wound or irrevocable forfeiture under 800 words, capping character depth just below the 8.8 gate. Her contradictory impulses (exultation in the storm vs fear of oily shadow) play through the scene, though secondary figures are absent, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lin’s interiority is freshly precise—her synesthesia of heartbeats with dye pulses crystallizes one key beat; the donor-heart as narrative vessel elevates a single beat to closure, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile curiosity about sorrow, the cut that knits under moonlight—but the final “smile” feels unearned; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene to justify the shift from wary isolation to quiet acceptance. The trees’ memories touch him, yet the moment is narrated rather than embodied, blurring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's interiority is consistent and specific—“Through forgotten songs, we remember how to live” distills her value hierarchy. The micro-choice to lay her palm on the mica and draw the melody is embodied, costly (hoarse, exhausted), and irreversible. The memory fragments generate a believable struggle without explanatory filler. Only minor excess reflection late prevents a 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s grief and reclusive empathy are credibly embodied, but her decisive turn—choosing to stay—relies more on thematic statement than on a dramatized cost. The letters supply motivation yet appear only at the end, so the internal contradiction leading to her renunciation is asserted rather than enacted. Interiority is specific but flirts with therapeutic summary (“felt seen”).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his “breath hitching” at the impossible bread, the tremor in his hands while planting—but the final stance crystallizes more through image than through a visible renunciation with cost. The woman’s appearance supplies external pressure, yet her dialogue is too expository to deepen status dynamics. Motivation (“find the sacred”) is dramatized, not labeled, and the sunflower-seed swap earns a micro-choice that forecloses nostalgia. Still, the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s gently meticulous nature is embodied in precise micro-choices—aligning quills, tuning the prism, matching pitch to violet—yet the interior contradiction between urgency and meticulous care is only sketched. The final smile feels earned because her methodical sampling visibly rekindles the library, but the cost (exhaustion, time lost) is implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—embodied fear in the bell chamber, contradictory loyalty to a father who betrayed her. The watch-fob choice crystallizes her value hierarchy (silence vs. truth) with visible cost. The buyer’s single scene still exerts pressure, forcing Lira’s decisive smash. Minor: “curiously steadfast” is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael’s skepticism and taste-based method are vivid, but his final shift to acceptance is stated more than dramatized; the cost is implied rather than embodied. Interiority is strong until the closing beat, where ambiguity softens the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for color while trading it for coins—grounds every beat; the embodied ache in his charcoal-blackened fingers and the micro-choice to fit the lock into a shadow-door crystallize his renunciation with visible cost. The final sketching feels earned because the lock’s click forecloses the old life. Minor slip: “suppressed creativity… like a wound” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—truth-seeking vs. maternal grief—are embodied in the quill’s physical reaction; the final choice to treat the “empty” orb as seed is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of literal words, gain of presence). Interiority is specific, sensory, and avoids label-speak. Secondary character (keeper) applies direct pressure that alters the relationship state. Flaws complicate choices and remain unresolved, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vow of silence and her desire to “preserve the color of wonder” are clear motives, but they are stated more than dramatized; her interiority is lyrical yet abstract. The final smile and bell-strike show a credible renunciation, yet the cost feels symbolic rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the character remains serene throughout. Still, the arc is coherent and the endurance reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority vividly concretized (“metallic fingers brushing dust”; “optic static surging”), yet the childhood-fear box feels summarised rather than embodied; one moment of contradictory impulse (“resolve inner static”) lands cleanly; final renunciation shows cost but motivation shifts rely more on epiphanic summary than sustained contradictory drives.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s curiosity and curator’s eye are vivid, but her interiority never collides with a contradictory impulse; the “listening” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a risky choice. The final beat—tears over the soldier’s letter—earns resonance, yet the cost is sentimental rather than personal. Secondary voices (Mrs. Ruiz, Mr. Hale) serve lore, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradiction—poetic vulnerability vs. methodical control—is embodied in every micro-choice: the ink on fingers, the tremor of dice, the dance-mirroring. Motive tightens palpably toward the final antidote liberation, visible cost on the page. No second character, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief for his erased wife is vivid and embodied in the pressed flowers, but interiority drifts toward summary (“memories he’d lost years ago”). The final choice to guide others is declared rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (hush the prophecy) is clear and embodied through tactile ritual; interiority is specific—nebula/earth eyes, paper fibers drinking water. Yet the summoner’s internal contradiction (fear of cosmic roar vs. calm mastery) is asserted rather than dramatized in the moment of choice, and the final “smile” feels unearned after the promised cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—scholarly skepticism vs. longing for wonder—surface in the tremor of his hand on the seal and the ache in his teeth. The woman’s nimble patience is embodied in her silent step over ivy, not labeled. Their shared history of “agreed-upon lies” is dramatized through the sugar/tea micro-choice that reweights trust. Final stance crystallizes when he speaks from bone, not throat—cost is the library’s shudder and the voice in the walls.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—archiving pain vs. repurposing it—are dramatized in the shell-circle ritual; the embodied cost (sparks burning skin) earns her shift from isolation to independence. Interiority is specific, but “tragically radiant” remains more label than lived constraint until the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lirael’s interiority is embodied—trembling fingers, iron taste of regret—and her contradictory impulse (to betray in order to forgive) is dramatized through the micro-choice of pricking her thumb. The final renunciation—leaving the scroll in the niche—earns its cost by the prior blood-seal and the ache in her joints. Flaws (guilt, exhaustion) complicate every beat. Only the queen’s backstory drifts into summary, muting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his breath catching, the seashell pressed to heart—but the final renunciation (“to keep singing”) is more stated than embodied; we don’t feel the cost of that choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is evocative—“windows were fragile things”—but his contradictory impulses remain abstract; no single micro-choice under pressure crystallizes his arc. The final renunciation (placing the globe) is emotionally resonant yet causally under-motivated on-page. Secondary characters appear only as dream cameos, so relationship crucible is absent by scope. Still, embodied grief and vocation-specific perception keep him above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interior is layered and particular yet his actions are mostly receptive observation rather than pressing choice; the only concrete choice—the mirror-whistling reply—does little to foreclose options or reveal fresh contradiction, so the “earned cost” criterion is only weakly met via contemplative stance rather than material consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s skeptical, pattern-seeking mind is credibly embodied in tactile beats (kneeling in loam, reassembling shreds). Her final choice to sacrifice the flawed diamond is foreshadowed by earlier micro-choices and carries visible cost (loss of the orchard’s miracle). Interiority stays concrete, though a touch more contradiction at the climax would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s isolation and obsession are embodied in tactile radio work and storm-touch, but interiority drifts into lyric summary (“to shape a new dawn…”) rather than contradiction under pressure; final laugh is earned yet cost feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—thief of echoes vs. keeper of memory—surface in the moment he hesitates before the first jar, but the interiority flirts with label-speak (“gnawing need to sweeten the world’s sharp edges”). The final renunciation of being remembered in favor of remembering lands with felt cost, yet the shift from scavenger to communal bridge is slightly under-cooked in micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—“breath fogged… logically emotional” embodies the contradiction driving him—and micro-choices (dial adjustments, palm on ice) tie motive to action. The ghost exchange flips intimidation into consent, a beat under pressure that pays prior causality. Cost feels visceral: sweat, blurring vision, exhaustion after “sonic absolution.” Only flaw: minor repetitions—“logically emotional,” “adapted once more” near the end read as label-restates, not new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    The mapper’s traits are sketched—vigilant, obsessed with precision—but interior contradiction is thin; his bodily cost and steadier hands are shown rather than felt, so endurance earns low resonance at this length. A clearer flaw or clashing value would have made the final stance feel costlier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara's traits are specific—she adjusts her belt, grips the lantern, steadies her breathing—but interior contradiction is summarized ("she’d been a fool") rather than dramatized; micro-choices (lighting the lantern, reading the files) are causal, yet final renunciation feels asserted rather than cost-drenched on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Marcus’s interiority is textured—his deliberate nature is embodied in the slow tracing of the music-box edge and the withheld breath of the shop—but the decisive shift from suspicion to advocacy is compressed into a single, slightly abstract beat (“he knew what he must do”) rather than dramatized with visible cost. The clockwork heart functions as an externalized conscience, yet Marcus’s contradictory impulses (doubt vs. hope) are stated more than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s obsession with the arrow-tip and the bell is vivid, her “gears with feet” jab shows voice, and the final risk taken is consistent with her irreverence. Interiority stays concrete (“breath hitched,” hands tremble) and the micro-choice to press the tip to the kaleidoscope crystallizes her agency. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-air; she never doubts the leap, so the arc is single-track. Still, the earned cost—crashing the Skein to make the bell hum—lands with character coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her pulse quickens, her fingers tremble—but the contradiction between duty and obsession is stated more than dramatized. The final resolve is credible, yet the cost is more declared (“she was already gone”) than embodied. Hale’s presence supplies external pressure, but his oily menace is generic, muting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“skin held the faint silver sheen”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to “give the storm a heart” is resonant yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with under pressure. Micro-choices (lighting lantern, walking the mirrors) are present but lack visible cost until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila's numb-grief detachment shows in micro-choices—clutching the parasol tip, welcoming toe-numbing pain—and culminates in an Earned Stasis that still feels slightly generalized; the shift from intending suicide to feeling “a flicker of peace” is legible but short of a fully embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is quietly textured—his pocketed letter, the “quiet force” of his presence—but the moment he hands the letter to Lila, his motive shifts from watcher to nudger without visible internal friction; the final walk is a shared beat rather than a crucible that alters either relationship state. Lila’s arc is sketched rather than embodied; her “I feel nothing” is stated, not dramatized in body or choice until the laugh at the end. The cost is diffuse—no path is foreclosed for either character—so the change feels gentle rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her peripheral awareness and scars anchor her—but the prophet remains a cipher; their relationship lacks crucible pressure. The “strangely honest” trait is shown only once (mask slip & laugh) and never complicates tactics. Closure choice (anchor the clearings) is earned, yet cost is diffuse rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s interiority is textured—her perceptively calm gaze, the meditative pencil motion—but the “collective healing” motive is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is forced into a costly choice. The final “enough” lands as earned stasis, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s reticence and drive to decode growth are clear, but interiority drifts into abstract lyricism (“weathered innocence”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from silence to resolve is signaled, yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally staked.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to the chalk yet despairing of its fading power—manifests in embodied actions like "knelt by a... sculpture" and "hands raw." The final micro-choice—thicker chalk line after renouncing foresight—shows earned cost. The curse label "precognitive forgetfulness" skirts diagnostic shorthand but is grounded in sensory stakes, so only a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—hands “steady as star charts,” the leaf-fall memory—but the leap at the end feels slightly unearned; we needed one more beat of visible cost or doubt to crystallize the renunciation of earthbound time.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—“frayed edge of a broken vinyl,” “scent of lavender and hope”—but the “flawless goodbye” motivation is stated rather than dramatized until the final gift of the shard. The mother-backstory is brief and alters present tactics, satisfying BRR. Elias’s single spoken line and Clara’s anchor-grip create a believable crucible, though status dynamics remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s quiet deliberation is embodied in micro-choices—adjusting telescopes, aligning the key—but her interiority stays generic; the “where shadows go” motive is stated rather than dramatized as a felt contradiction. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The final choice (inserting the key) is causally earned yet the cost is only conceptual, not viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s skepticism and curiosity are embodied in tactile choices (testing thorns, aligning teeth) and crystallize in the mirror insight; Elias’s grief and mischief feel lived-in. Their shared history surfaces through gesture and subtext rather than exposition. The final recognition of mutual avoidance carries credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority deepens steadily; her grief, resolve, and ethical calculus crystallize in the final release without cliché. Still, secondary characters are absent, and the pass-the-light gesture reads almost too neat; the flaw is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—clinging to guilt versus grafting new life—are dramatized in the pendant moment; the final choice to plant the sapling with Elias is earned and visibly costs her isolation. Interiority is concrete, but the “quietly proactive” label for Elias is asserted rather than embodied. Relationship pressure is present but mild; status shift is legible yet understated.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s interior contradiction—needing neat endings yet hating them—drives every beat; the seashell’s warmth and her deletion of the last chapter embody embodied cost. The stranger’s single line (“endings aren’t walls—they’re doors”) crystallizes the reconfiguration, but the stranger herself is more oracle than crucible, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s motives are legible—restore fading magic and anchor the community—and her embodied urgency shows in aching hands and damp cheeks. Choice-agency, however, is concentrated in the final invitation (“Will you help me remember?”) rather than dramatized in a wrenching decision; the cost (vine to dust) is borne by the prop, not her character flaw. Interior contradiction is present but muted: her need to “keep stories spinning” is underplayed. Earned stasis works, yet feels more extension than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied (cold in fingers, measured pauses); choices made under pressure close off paths. The sealing act magnifies both patience and cost, foreclosing easy triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s peripheral focus is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—angling the mirror, mapping light shifts—rather than labels. Interiority stays embodied (“his reflection warping in the mirror”) and contradictory (wonder vs. grave). The final act of reassembly is earned by prior study and carries visible cost: the cavern’s hum reclaims its voice while Elias quietly forfeits center-stage ownership. Only the keeper’s single line of dialogue feels slightly expository, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, sweat, and memory of his mother’s voice all embody the stakes. The refusal to melt his mother’s locket crystallizes a credible, costly stance. Yet the mother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent; the score caps just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s grief is embodied through tactile carving, but interiority drifts toward therapeutic summary (“Loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation”). Micro-choices (first shallow cut, final placement on sill) are present yet lack contradictory impulse under pressure; the arc is gentle acceptance rather than struggle. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Earned stasis feels credible but cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veyra’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fragments while yearning to release—are embodied in her calloused fingers and the camera wheel she both treasures and sacrifices. The ghost’s accusation “you haven’t forgiven yourself” crystallizes her internal cost, and her final wade into the lagoon is an earned renunciation that forecloses her scavenger path. Interiority is specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. Only the mother’s laughter feels slightly abstract, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila’s curiosity and “functional creativity” are repeatedly asserted but only briefly embodied when she reroutes conduits; the internal contradiction between nostalgia and repurposing is sketched rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice—leaving to refine the equation—carries mild poise yet lacks a felt cost on the page. Character voice is coherent but leans on stock phrases (“stoic wonder,” “restlessness mirrored decay”).

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, brass scent, petrichor memory—but the moment of change pivots on the bear’s gaze rather than a concrete micro-choice she makes; the “nod” is too light to bear the full weight of her renunciation. The contradiction between safety and wildness is present yet not embodied in simultaneous action; it surfaces as reflection after the encounter. The cost—remaining yet “no longer shackled”—is stated, not dramatized. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers tracing the rim,” “breath caught”), but the moment of self-confrontation (“darkness within himself”) is asserted rather than dramatized. The final choice to enter the warehouse is motivated, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Secondary pressure from the captain is present but too brief to act as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s drive to decode the rope and the reverence evoked by the glass read as particular; however, his interior contradictions (“patient, infinitely patient” as stance) never collide in visible micro-choice—until the final beat he merely interprets rather than risks losing anything. No felt cost for the choice to “kneel again” lowers this from excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, contradictory, and embodied (e.g., ink-stained fingers embracing moss), but her decisive “choice” to walk away is foregone rather than forged—no visible alternative path or cost appears on the page before she smiles. Hence the motivation feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned by crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Corvin’s yearning is palpable and embodied; the trembling hands, sunken eyes, and frantic note-taking all serve the motive. Interior contradiction is thin—he never doubts the quest—so the arc feels more linear than crucible. Still, the final orb-in-palm moment crystallizes a credible renunciation of pure mechanism, paid for by years of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s guilt, restlessness, and inherited identity are embodied through tactile micro-choices—drilling the coin, splinting the wing, letting the grain fall—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The internal contradiction (firefighter daughter of an arsonist) is dramatized, not stated, and the final renunciation of the coin carries visible cost. Secondary characters apply immediate pressure, but Mara’s arc resolves too quickly to serve as a true crucible, capping the score just below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs believer—remains vivid and embodied; the moment she kneels at the fountain and murmurs “You’re still here” crystallizes the tension. Micro-choices (pressing shard, tucking violet) align with motive and escalate cost. The final smile, though brief, carries earned ambivalence and visible cost: the box is empty, the city alive, her doubt intact. Yet the reflective blocks edge the 20 % limit and dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lumin’s interior contradiction—yearning for fire yet fearing its violence—is embodied in trembling hands and micro-choices (adjusting the gear, placing it beneath the tree). The ghost’s warmth that “didn’t burn” crystallizes the cost of renouncing old fire, earning the final stance. One slip: the phrase “generational patterns were bridges” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marlow's quietly grieving artisan identity convinces (calloused hands, lantern rituals), interiority is specific, and the final renunciation—burying his own poem in stone rather than words—carries clear cost. The flaw/need balance falters only in the middle, where grief feels summarized rather than enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is embodied and specific—raw hands, salt-stung throat—but the ethical-diligence trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the rake-handle discovery is the single moment where a prior choice (to listen) pays off, giving us a credible micro-turn. The felt cost is present but diffuse—more atmospheric than bodily—so the renunciation/continuation lands just shy of 8+ intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and caretaker identity are vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mind often adrift”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final renunciation to rebury the case is credible yet feels lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—fear of the blank page vs. compulsion to map ignorance—is embodied in trembling hands and ink-scent; her predictive obsession is shown through nightly climbs and data cross-checks. The final renunciation (burning journals) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interiority is textured—her cedar-scented cloak, the way static feels under her fingertips—but her contradictory impulses (archive vs. share) stay mostly summary. The final beat of “carrying the stories inside her” is earned, yet the cost is soft; we see no forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s contradictory drives—art vs annihilation—show in scene, but the mask and ash are more prop than extension of self. Choices feel horizonal, not narrowing, until the final pieta image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s contradictory urges—idolizing a brass cog versus despairing at human forgetting—show simultaneously without tidy resolution. Micromoves (hands bleed while digging, refusal to sell) reveal values hierarchy. The final stance of “understood in sewer’s abrasive calm” earns Earned Stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motivation to “save dying arts” is clear, but late‐story influx of new artists turns her into a facilitator rather than choosing agent, dampening earned cost; grandmother thread felt as sentimental prompt rather than active constraint. Still, her embodied listening and micro-choice to invite others earn moderate charge.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s synesthetic gift and “gentle rebellion” motive are vivid, but interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“she’d often whisper”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final pruning choice carries felt cost and aligns with her established traits, yet earlier memories arrive as neat thematic packets rather than clashing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s involuntary candor is dramatized in her barbed coffee quip and later weaponized when she decides to “weaponize” honesty to reboot wonder; the shift from social liability to tactical asset is embodied and costs her the safety of routine. Interior contradiction surfaces when she both craves routine and yearns for awe, shown in her fogged-booth breath and the “spark” she feels when the child engages. Voss functions mainly as exposition mouthpiece, flattening relational pressure, so the crucible is internal rather than interpersonal. Final renunciation of anonymity carries felt cost: she must stand outside the booth and risk ridicule to keep wonder alive.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“fingers brushing a shard…smelled of forgotten gardens”—but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final smile feels unearned because no prior flaw or cost is dramatized. Motivation is clear, yet the absence of a visible renunciation or mistake caps emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s interiority is palpable and consistent: fear, dawning wonder, cost of grandmother’s lost humanity all register via body and choice. Contradictory impulses—duty vs grief—do not alternate in summary but braid within single beats. The final act of drinking the serum is earned by prior causality and visibly costs her: “garden shuddered, as if breathing.” Yet the stone statue’s empathy remains telegraphed more than fully dramatized in action, keeping it shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s grim-optimist contradiction is embodied in the dice ritual and the 42.7% figure; the final renunciation—letting the dice orbit—earns its cost because earlier beats tether the chipped die to childhood guilt and the vanished lover. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The only cap is that the lover remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—exhaustion vs. creative compulsion, skepticism vs. hope—are embodied in her charcoal-smeared fingers and trembling brush. The moment she hands the brush to Mr. Voss crystallizes her renunciation of solitary authorship and accepts relational cost. Interiority stays concrete (“smudging charcoal onto wool,” “brush’s weight felt like a promise”). Minor slip: “methodically hopeful” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s motivation to “rescue dying arts” is explicit and consistent, but interiority drifts into summary (“her voice had frayed”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—to host a festival and bake bread—earns its cost through the children’s hopeful faces and the oven’s heat, yet the emotional stakes feel slightly generalized rather than uniquely hers.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s obsession with reversing time is vivid, embodied in trembling hands and “bleak exhilaration.” Internal contradiction—triumph laced with terror—surfaces in the final beat. Yet the father’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost of legacy. The earned stasis feels credible, but the prior emotional layering could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—terror vs. resolve—are embodied in the tightening of the clasp and the copper taste of the lie; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost (seared palm, golden pulse). Vey’s pressure is present but too cryptic to register as a second crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leeward’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling hands, salt-taste of victory—but the contradiction between her need for harmony and the physical toll never quite collides in a single moment; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost (raw fingers, aching arms) is summarized rather than dramatized as a fresh wound.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s obsession with the lost expedition and her mother’s fate is vivid and embodied; the reed whistle, journal, and pattern language all press her toward the crack. Internal contradiction surfaces when awe collides with terror at the watchers. The final stance—standing her ground while the city wakes—earns its cost through prior causal chain. Minor slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her historian’s lens colors every perception—and her micro-choice to pry the T-letter carries visible cost (foreclosing the myth). Tomas’s emotionally rational tone is consistent and pressures her stance. The only drag is a brief “she understood” summary that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s stoic/sensitive duality is embodied in micro-choices—kneeling to write, trembling inkwell, deliberate smear—each revealing cost. The final note she leaves crystallizes her arc: she accepts the emotional price of connection. Grandmother’s initials provide credible backstory that tilts present choice. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile cataloguing of books, the embodied chill of stone, the owl stamp as talisman—but the final “purpose” feels slightly abstract, not fully paid for by prior micro-choices. The shift from cataloguer to truth-bearer is credible yet compressed; more friction between her need for order and the cost of revelation would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; grief is folded into tactile craft. Yet the brother’s absence is filtered through summary more than micro-choice, and the final stance (“I’m not afraid”) feels slightly ahead of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-driven compulsion is visceral and embodied; the geode’s bite and her “shattered-glass laugh” ground her interiority. The final crystallization of identity from survivor to seer is earned by the escalating cost of each choice. Minor slip: “what’s left to lose?” edges toward diagnostic shorthand but is immediately re-embodied in the crater descent.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s curiosity and competence are clear, but her “perpetually surprised” trait never complicates a choice; the pilgrim remains cipher-like, so relationship pressure is absent. Interiority is vivid yet never contradictory; the final “listen” beat is a soft landing rather than an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied in the trembling watch-hand and tactile driftwood search; the final resolve to break silence is earned by prior visions. Interior contradiction—career liar choosing truth—plays in real time. Cost is felt: “some truths were too heavy to carry alone.” Minor slip: “guilt that pulsed beneath his ribs” edges toward diagnostic label.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the brass pull anchors her regret and hope without slipping into label-speak. The final choice to release the pull is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost. Elias’s mirrored pull adds a subtle status shift, though his interior remains less exposed. One micro-choice—dropping the pull—crystallizes her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. longing) are embodied in micro-choices—gripping the paddle, leaving the compass—yet the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed; the “weight of her own choices” is asserted more than dramatized. Interiority is vivid and specific, avoiding therapy-speak. The compass as regret-measurer is a fresh, character-bound lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—calculation vs. nascent empathy—surface in the lake’s reflections, but the interiority leans toward summary (“she felt something akin to hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. The baseball as compass is a strong micro-choice, yet her final vow reads slightly abstract. Cost is present (loss of certainty) but not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to humanity while surrendering to transformation—are dramatized in embodied beats (feathered fingers, throat tightening). The final metamorphosis is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “reluctant metamorphosis was her lot” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for reunion while fearing the cost—drives every beat; the saucer, cloth, and cards are extensions of her guilt. Micro-choices (tracing her own palm, climbing the hourglass tree) embody the stakes. Final renunciation of perpetual penance is earned by prior embodied grief and costs her the fantasy of endless atonement.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s internal contradiction—refusal of violence vs cosmic need—grounds her choices; she shows trembling hands, laughter that alters her gravity-weighted body, and the micro-choice of pressing palm to door stitches her fear to action. Motivation stays character-anchored: pacifism is cost, not label. The earned moment comes when her own shadow work, not an external force, dissolves the darkness into light. Minor slippage: “gravitationally lighter” reads concept more than body, yet its link to joy vs fear feels coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; contradictory strains of altruism and exhaustion surface in scene. Motivation to "fix" vs "transform" is seeded early and crystallizes in the leaving of the glowing footprint—earned renunciation. Drop of 0.2 for occasional therapy-adjacent self-absorption ("I just wanted...").

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kieran’s vigilance and Elara’s calm inventiveness are sketched through action and dialogue, but interior contradiction is thin; the final choice to descend feels more strategic than emotionally fraught, so the cost is intellectual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—obey the promise vs. fear the storm—are dramatized in each rock placement; her final renunciation to “listen” rather than control is earned by the prior failed sequences and the star-dust flare that blinds her. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tears mingling with salt) and stays character-specific. The only cap is that the mother remains off-stage, so status/relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—fear of the Ministry vs hunger for uncensored truth—are embodied in the cracked mask and the envelope he fingers. The micro-choice to seal the new poem in wax crystallizes his renunciation of hiding and carries visible cost (exposure risk). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the cartographer remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s mechanical arm and Elyra’s diplomatic ferocity are embodied in micro-choices—arm gears clicking with thought, blade grazing shoulder—yet interior contradiction is more asserted than dramatized; the final “I evolve” lands as earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cedar’s molting trait is embodied in trembling hands and shifting eyes, but the monthly mechanic is asserted more than dramatized; the final acceptance of chaos is earned through the discovered poem, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to this molt. Marla’s presence supplies relational pressure, but her daughter’s mention is a late graft that doesn’t bend Cedar’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clara’s internal stakes—need for freedom versus fear of choice—are embodied and consistent, culminating in the decision to “leave the piano open” as earned resistance. Secondary characters absent, but single-POV interiority is vivid and contradiction (creative “curse”) plays live. One reflective block is cleanly anchored to the broken clock and folds into present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her chest tightened,” “seed grew warm”), and her contradictory impulse—doubt that memory may not be worth saving—drives the climax. Yet the moment of resolve feels slightly under-costed; the seed vanishes and the air “thrums,” but no concrete forfeiture or bodily price is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Yorick’s quiet precision and Lira’s desperate search fuse in embodied, tactile emotion—thumb on bonsai bark, fingers tightening on compass. Both reveal interior contradictions (patience vs haste, blame vs longing) that escalate to the final reprise; their reconciliation carries visibly felt cost in the translucent father and the shimmering lace no longer needed.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction ("fractured focus" vs. "preprocessing reality") shown through micro-choices like ignoring institute demands, but "humility gnawed at her" slips into therapy-speak, weakening embodied struggle at pivotal self-doubt moment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority shines through concrete details ("glassworker’s fingers scraping stone") and embodied emotion ("hollow, creativity frayed"), but the "steadily adaptive" trait remains told until climax, slightly undermining early motivation. Survival backstory reflection exceeds BRR’s 20% limit without sufficient micro-choices to alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s embodied trauma (trembling hands, heat-mapped grief) and micro-choices (freezing at Elias’s arrival, leaving notes) reveal contradictory impulses. Her endurance—redefining music without reclaiming voice—earns closure through prior causality, though "silently expressive" leans slightly told.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (resisting history while welding shards) culminate in earned renunciation ("my rest is here now") with visible cost of worldview abandonment; goldfish memory slightly over-articulated but grounded in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation to replace anonymity with naming feels earned through observed patterns and micro-choices (e.g., widow interaction). Slight over-reliance on "gently persistent" label, but redeemed by concrete action like tracing donations through midnight runs.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction (artist vs healer) embodied in micro-choices like tasting the tear and kneeling at the pool, but epiphany lacks sufficient struggle; "spiritually curious" label risks diagnostic-speak near-cliff.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority leans abstract ("obsession lay in the way time folded") with diagnostic phrasing ("retrocognitively trapped"), weakening embodied emotion. Final choice to design mazes "to remember" is earned by prior causality, but contradictions lack simultaneous tension during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s "patiently strategic" nature manifests concretely in studying keys for days and waiting for stellar alignment, driving her final hurl of the vial. Contradictory impulses (urgency vs. patience) surface through embodied tension ("chains biting into wrists") rather than abstract labels. Scavengers lack depth but single-POV focus justifies this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction evident in "battered but marveling" final beat, though "pain was exhilarating" risks borderline label-speak without deeper embodied degradation under stress during crucible scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses crystallize in the photo offering—Elara’s history of taking versus giving her own memory—earning the closure choice with embodied cost (wilted lily, transformed photo). No stock phrasing; "gloves slick with sweat" concretizes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in narrating tasks ("absurd, yet they lent weight"), but micro-choices under pressure lack density; the pivotal bookmark reexamination lacks a visible trade-off despite earned closure through backstory resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Contradictory impulses shine (trembling hands vs. steady voice during confrontation), and final shell-withholding choice earns cost through mirrored maternal trembling. Mother's café confession lacks sufficient prior groundwork for full emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vivid but motivation lacks concrete stakes; "mild obsession" constrains action yet cost remains abstract (aching fingers vs. tangible sacrifice). Final smile lacks earned weight despite strong embodied details like trembling lips.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines in "composed rhythm" vs. "logic core flickered" during temporal overload, but the epiphany resolves slightly too tidily without sufficient struggle in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—meticulous registrar vs. curious decoder—drive his choice to engage with the ticket stubs, culminating in earned renunciation of his mistrust. Lira’s line about honesty lands with embodied cost (“throat tightened”), avoiding therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s embodied micro-choices (redirecting vines, polishing marbles) reveal pragmatic resilience, but Joren’s shift lacks sufficient contradictory impulses; his transformation feels earned yet under-stressed in the pivotal sensor-blocking moment.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Veyra's interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("curiosity") remains abstract despite embodied stress. No visible trade-off when recalibrating—competence overshadows struggle, weakening earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Contradictory impulses manifest physically: trembling hands yet decisive memorization of symbols. Final choice earned by prior causality (dismissing smudges until symbols match sheet music), with visible cost in soaked state and lost program. No diagnostic labels, only embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction (oracle logic vs. embodied truth) drives micro-choices like smudging the illustration, but the herbalist resolution feels slightly convenient without deeper friction. Embodied emotion ("metallic tang of swallowed truth") avoids therapy-speak yet the fever's role in her transformation lacks sufficient causal groundwork for full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (skeptic vs truth-seeker) act simultaneously during hologram revelation; final renunciation of truth's burden earned through visceral physicality ("valve wheel felt heavier"). Slight underdevelopment of motivation beyond "thrill of the unknown" prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in keeper's judgment-vs-witness tension, embodied via "grip on reality loosening," but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during pivotal river-crossing moment; micro-choices like hand-dipping reveal values without full-blown internal war.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s skepticism-to-"cautious exuberance" shift, embodied through tactile choices (closing eyes against nature). Elara’s mellow patience manifests in cello-playing micro-choices under eclipse pressure. No diagnostic labels; flaws (Mara’s rigidity) compound organically before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but final choice lacks prior tension. "Sensitively perceptive" remains label-only without embodied tradeoffs during high-stakes discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction evident in Elara's restlessness vs. controlled craft; embodied choices (clutching specs, trembling hands) reveal hierarchy of values. Slight motivation shift lacks deeper prior contradiction, though final cookie-sealing micro-choice charges cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    Exterior action dominates interiority; motivation ("illuminate hidden assumptions") lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Micro-choices like brush swipes reveal focus but no hierarchy of values under pressure. No second character to test relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (writing faster before exhaustion hits), but "exhaustion loomed like a thief" edges toward bodily cliché without sufficient specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority shows contradictory impulses (floating vs. grounded desire), but emotional embodiment lacks specificity in pivotal choices; "heart heavy with weight of possibility" abstracts rather than concretizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Embodied emotion shines ("chest hollow," numb hands); micro-choices like selecting Coltrane reveal character under pressure. Contradictory impulses (seeking silence vs. craving connection) drive the earned closure without therapy-speak. Elias applies perfect secondary pressure through tactile wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Contradictory impulses (data vs intuition) drive choices; embodied "hands shook" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of isolation earned by courtyard clinic contrast. Slight tell in "intuit that the quarantine wasn't just a health risk" edges toward diagnostic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("curse" vs "gift") earned through embodied memory flood; micro-choice to uncork vial shows hierarchy of values with visible cost in trembling hands and tears. Avoids diagnostic labels despite high emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Contradictory impulses (outrunning time vs. feeling weight of unwritten lines) drive micro-choices like untying knots, with embodied cost in "throat tightened" and "breath caught." "Ethically playful" trait lacks sufficient pressure-testing beyond initial laugh, slightly weakening flaw integration.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction in "hating silence" yet seeking beauty in silence; embodied grief via damp violin and bowl warmth; micro-choice placing violin over bowl reveals hierarchy of values. No second character limits relationship depth.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's motivation ("fuse insight with empathy") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; his "affectionate detachment" remains stated rather than embodied through conflicted choices under pressure. Lira functions as a transactional prop without meaningful friction against his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Clara’s cargo-broker precision clashing with emotional outreach (forging the conductor’s letter), embodied through micro-choices like tapping the locket frame. No diagnostic labels; the "ache of unspoken things" roots epiphany in concrete sensory history.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority vividly embodied ("luminescent ache"), but Lira's test motivation lacks sufficient causal groundwork in her introduction, slightly undermining the revelation's earned impact despite strong micro-choices during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction shines in Lila’s fear/curiosity during the fissure reveal; her sketching impulse as micro-choice under pressure ("pencil flying") earns the final endurance with visible cost. No therapy-speak in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) manifest physically in micro-choices like tracing cracks while pouring sap. Embodied emotion avoids labels: "tears mixing with the sap" concretizes her shift without therapy-speak. Epiphany earned through tactile ritual, not abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marin’s insomnia and artistic struggle manifest in concrete micro-choices (e.g., following rain trails), but her instant trust of the stranger lacks sufficient internal friction to justify the brooch exchange’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's embodied conflict shines (throat tightening, vision blurring), but the pilgrim lacks interior contradiction—archetypal wisdom without vulnerability. Micro-choice closing the pearl is earned; secondary character pressure feels functional, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s methodical patience shows embodied motivation, but her internal contradiction (archive duty vs. exile trauma) lacks visceral layering; the fisherman encounter reveals character through action, yet her core drive remains slightly abstract without sufficient flawed struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (cage vs. compass) and embodied emotion ("breath caught," "pulse quickening") power the climax. Final choice to take the ticket earns closure through prior causality, though flaw complexity slightly lacks visible struggle beyond hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interior contradiction between skepticism and wonder emerges late; "skepticism wavered" summarizes rather than shows embodied conflict during transcription. Micro-choice to transcribe earns closure but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in Kael's terror at freedom after eons of boredom, embodied through physical reactions ("breath hitched," metallic taste).

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs tactical clarity from ink) drive choices, but her sudden mastery of adult negotiation strains plausibility for a 12-year-old; the asylum demand lacks visible cost scaling to her age.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    No contradictory impulses under pressure; micro-choices lack friction despite precise actions. "Earnestly studious" trait remains untested label without tradeoffs during the hum climax.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Kael's dual identity tension and sensory perception, but motivation for fragment-collecting lacks layered friction; the "void where memories should be" tells rather than embodies his compulsion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority shines through tactile expertise and humming lullaby micro-choice; blindness isn’t a trait but a sensory framework driving her servo recalibration under pressure. Marlow’s "gift" dialogue risks sentimentality but lands through embodied shoulder touch and her embarrassed shrug.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's motivation to uncover rivers' "reasons" drives her choices with embodied contradiction (confidence vs. vulnerability). Jorn's warnings deepen stakes without flattening her agency. "Rivers are alive" edges toward label-speak but redeemed by visceral cost of snow burial.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ghost bride’s contradictory impulses (loving/venomous) drive choices under pressure, but Elara’s interiority lacks depth; micro-choices like placing the bead show value hierarchy with cost ("trembling, held the bead aloft").

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira's motivation to "carve a path from ruin to reverence" is embodied through sewing actions and raw fingers, but lacks contradictory impulses; "hauntingly optimistic" heart is shown via smile, yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped despite credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marisol’s contradictory impulses (control as restorer vs surrender to uncertainty) drive her micro-choices, with the final stance crystallization—exchanging certainty for curiosity—earned through embodied cost (throat tightening, pulse quickening) and irreversible knowledge shift.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction ("carefully reckless") manifests in micro-choices (ignoring warnings to work late), but "symphonies of truth" concept risks abstractness; embodied emotion strong ("throat tighten") though trust epiphany borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation remains abstract ("encrypted compassion" as goal lacks embodied stakes); no contradictory impulses shown during decryption—thrill overshadows risk.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s reinvented history vs gnawing truth, with embodied choices like ignoring client notes while decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is concrete (calloused hands, cold water) but lacks contradictory impulses; final acceptance isn't earned by struggle—flaws never complicate choices. "Before everything shifted" hint remains unexploited tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (guilt vs acceptance) act simultaneously during hourglass scene; final renunciation of self-punishment earned by tactile micro-choices like tipping the sand. "You are not broken" whisper avoids diagnostic label-speak through embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction weak; "forgiving himself" backstory lacks on-page tension during rope-weaving climax. Motivation clear but micro-choices lack hierarchy (e.g., no trade-off between speed/accuracy). Embodied emotion strong via trembling hands and raw skin.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority rich but "precisely playful" trait remains label-heavy during climax; hologram's "you see cracks where light seeps" crosses into diagnostic speak (-0.4). Embodied contradiction weakens when epiphany merges foresight/hindsight too rationally.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elara's frugality-as-armor clashing with her quest for metaphysical answers; the gasp at seeing her face etched into the tile crystallizes embodied cost. Micro-choices like brushing sand from the panel reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lirael’s "scheming" trait lacks active demonstration beyond ritual setup; secondary characters like Kael shift too quickly without sufficient friction. Strengths: cellular memory sacrifice shows embodied motivation, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shown through Elias' steady hands versus breath catching at "runaway dream" mention. Micro-choice to hand over mirror carries visible cost but stranger's underdevelopment limits relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority anchored in concrete cues (ribbon, copper wire) avoids therapy-speak, but Mara’s absence limits relationship crucible; "endearingly feisty" trait lacks embodied tradeoffs during mending pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (pride in knowledge vs. need to admit ignorance) act in scene when throat tightens at mirror door description. Kael’s disappearance lacks visible struggle cost; "reluctant hero" tag feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira and Veyra's embodied contradictions drive authentic tension—Veyra's "Trapped freedom" skepticism evolving into softening growl when witnessing recapture shows earned relationship shift. No therapy-speak; emotions manifest physically through scales, tail lashing, and antler touches. Final choice to sew their name crystallizes values with visible cost in "memories altered here, but not lost."

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation ("translate chaos into order") drives concrete micro-choices (e.g., reconfiguring braids amid sparks), with embodied contradiction (steady hands vs. trembling knees). Final transformation into "weaver of timelines" earns closure through prior causality, though flaw depth (beyond competence) lacks escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction shines in "not banished the noise, but found quiet within it" with embodied cost (ribs aching → relief). No diagnostic labels; micro-choices like tracing Braille-like cracks reveal hierarchy of values. Minor flaw: flaw depth lacks specific blindness beyond general struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's embodied struggle ("fingers bled," "dreamed of prism whole") grounds motivation in concrete micro-choices. Contradictory impulses (stubborn hope vs. despair when shard remains cold) intensify organically to earned closure. Slight underdevelopment of "stubborn hope" motivation early prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines via preemptive nostalgia driving micro-choices (kneeling to measure shadows), but flaw (archival detachment) lacks inevitable mistakes; epiphany earned yet agency feels too unimpeded by genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction (fear of past failure vs. hope) drives her chant intensification and "filter" action; embodied emotion in "breath hitched" and raw laugh avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to "become fire" earns renunciation of hopelessness through prior causality (mentor's lessons).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (retreat vs. bridge-building) manifest in micro-choices like repositioning the cicada; final choice earned through tactile memory work. Slight over-articulation in epiphany ("fermented, like seaweed") avoids diagnostic labels but edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction in "sprout wings of patience" shows simultaneous discipline/want; but "claustrophobia dissolved" is diagnostic label-speak triggering -0.4 deduction during peak gravity inversion.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's "wisely adventurous" trait drives micro-choices (pressing the flake despite hesitation), but internal conflict lacks layered contradiction during the guardian confrontation—her swift resolution feels tidily rational rather than authentically fraught under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority rooted in concrete action ("emptiness had grown heavier, a weight that pressed against her chest") avoids abstraction. Contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) manifest simultaneously when she touches Kael's shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s pyramid-scheme-honed distrust clashing with her "virtuously mischievous" leap to turn the bolt; embodied emotion in "respirator fogging" during her choice. Slight abstraction in "existential dread into resilience" dilutes immediacy.

    Interior contradiction ("shivering bliss" as dread/euphoria) and embodied emotion (rusty laugh, trembling fingers) drive credible transformation. Final choice earned through tactile micro-choices, though alchemist memory intrusion slightly over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Embodied emotion ("heart stuttering," "fingers trembling") and contradictory impulses (cynicism vs hope) shine; final choice to document is earned through dust-pattern micro-choices. Lacks one visible flaw-driven mistake testing his "broken-hearted" state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Contradictory impulses (scrawny girl vs proving worth) drive choices, but "indifference kills faster than bullets" is diagnostic label-speak in climax triggering -0.5. Jax lacks depth as secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("fear that laughter is not enough") drives the key choice to wield the tooth, but "modestly fearless" leans abstract despite concrete actions. Final endurance of hope earns cost through prior fear admission.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines via Lira’s professional role clashing with personal memory resonance; embodied choices (hand pressed to crack) earn closure with palpable cost in "cool and heavy in her grip." Final renunciation of brute force feels inevitable through prior sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias' dual role as technician and ghost-listener, with embodied emotion ("weightless burden pressing against his chest like a second skin"). Final choice to "repair stories" earned by dust-pattern micro-choices, though flaw integration lacks visible struggle beyond observation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation for compressing eternity is clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in action; "cryptic purpose fulfilled" leans toward tell over embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines when Lira's curiosity battles fear during descent ("prickle of curiosity" vs "hands trembling"). Final renunciation of certainty ("absence of answers") is earned through psychometry visions, but "hinged awakenings" concept slightly abstracts internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority strong via driftwood sculptures as embodied motivation, but "perpetually learning brain raced" slips into diagnostic label-speak. Contradictory impulses (fear vs curiosity) surface weakly during portal transition; micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs under pressure despite clear "scaffold complexity" drive.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; "quietly driven" trait enables scaffolding climbs yet remains untested under true pressure. Sister Agatha's functional but flat secondary presence limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction evident in "I can’t" versus "Lead on" choice, but emotional layering lacks depth during death vision; identity fraying feels abstract rather than embodied under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority avoids stock phrasing through embodied details ("gaunt face, eyes sunken," "tears mixing with salt spray"), but "hollow, a vessel emptied of purpose" edges toward abstract metaphor. Contradictory impulses (rejection of false comfort vs. desperate hope) drive choices credibly under memory-based pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority excels through concrete, character-particular embodiment ("spine tighten," "velvet disquiet") and contradictory impulses (dread vs. purpose in the shriek's reinterpretation). Final choice to listen rather than stop the storm is causally earned through lifelong archival practice, but micro-choices during memory immersion lack sufficient contradictory tension under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation clear but "furiously tranquil" remains label without sufficient embodied contradiction. Internal conflict alternates rather than coexists in key beats. Final choice earned yet lacks visceral tradeoff during the vortex dive climax.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses (duty vs curiosity) drive the rope switch and rhythm creation, with humility resisting praise while embracing responsibility. Cost is felt in her aching arms and the weight of ongoing vigilance, though Veyra remains functional rather than fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority richly embodied ("calloused hands," heart holding "grief and wonder"), but "spiritually curious" trait remains stated not tested; Veyra’s shift lacks sufficient prior friction to feel earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority leans tell-heavy ("tranquilly perceptive," "motivation was clear") with insufficient embodied contradiction; ghost interaction lacks micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values despite strong flaw integration (silence as burden).

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s embodied grief (urn fragment pressing thigh) and banker-to-poet contradiction drive choices. Final renunciation of the urn feels earned through tactile interactions, though internal tension between precision and poetry could deepen slightly at peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's embodied motivation ("discover beauty in the incomplete") drives every micro-choice under pressure; contradictions surface through action (weaving impermanence while seeking harmony), avoiding therapy-speak. The fisherman's silent nod provides external validation without breaking single-POV interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "brazen calm" amid mortality, but spirit dialogue's "You build walls/we build boxes" edges toward thematic echo rather than pure character voice, slightly diluting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael's interior contradiction (skepticism vs buried longing) drives her pivotal choice to test the amber, with embodied cost in "chest ached with familiar longing."

No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression layers rationality with irrational yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction between soldier past and gardener present feels embodied in "hands trained to wield swords, not seeds"; micro-choices like listening to bird calls deepen motivation. Slight emotional flattening in "he didn’t mind" under high stakes prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation to "translate distance into closeness" but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; bloodhound traits underutilized beyond sniffing grooves. "Intuitively descriptive" phrasing feels diagnostic rather than embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motivation but closure choice lacks earned causality; epiphany about "courage to swap" told not shown through prior micro-choices. Interiority relies on labels ("heart pounding") without embodied contradiction during pivotal king swap.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in "mimic grief so well she’d begun to forget where art ended," but "benevolently ruthless" label lacks embodied demonstration until climax. Final pawn realization earns change with visceral scar ache as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s embodied motivation ("need to understand the shape of home") drives visceral micro-choices like trembling with the feather.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses ("bridge between chaos and order" vs. "paralysis") drive the pivotal blood-sacrifice choice with visible cost: "ivory bit into his flesh, drawing blood" forecloses his old self without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lirael’s micro-choices (pocketing chain link, then using it publicly) reveal her value hierarchy, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the teaching scene; "adrift" feeling is embodied yet not actively wrestled with under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's motivation ("assure vulnerable voices") is clear and consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses; her compassion remains unchallenged, missing the 9+ requirement for simultaneous conflicting drives during pressure. The brief interaction with the widow shows embodied emotion ("fingers trembled") but insufficient status dynamics for meaningful relationship escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)

    Clear motivation but interior contradiction under peak pressure lacks specificity; "resonantly soft" remains abstract label without embodied tradeoffs during climax. Micro-choices (pressing shell to fissure) reveal values but emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution in final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's interiority excels through embodied micro-choices (admitting fear while working faster) and contradictory impulses (duty vs. dread), but Elias' "silence isn't always kindness" borders on thematic echo without sufficient character-specific framing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's borrowing of personalities manifests in concrete actions (Möbius poem, merchant posture) rather than labels, and his analytical/emotional contradiction crystallizes viscerally during the empathy merge. Minor deduction for "wildfires" abstraction momentarily flattening embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines: Kail's jittery fear battles duty in micro-choices (e.g., kneeling despite distrust). Epiphany earned through tactile sapling contact, not labels. Woman's thin characterization slightly limits relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (twisting wick despite oily darkness) and micro-decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority excels via "fingers brushing moss-speckled floorboards" and trembling hands during planting, revealing contradictory impulses (fear of touching bread vs. need to act).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines in "gently meticulous nature felt like a curse" under pressure, but emotional layering lacks depth during peak stress; micro-choices like fist-slam show embodied cost yet internal conflict remains somewhat surface-level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira's "stubbornness with a thesaurus" manifests in micro-choices (fob hesitation, false starts sharpening resolve), but the buyer lacks depth as pure antagonist. Contradictory impulses (grief vs duty) are embodied yet could deepen; "comforting unease" subtly charges the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction (weaving truth vs. shattering illusions) drives micro-choices under pressure, but the living characters’ off-page status limits on-scene relationship crucibles despite strong embodied emotion in dream sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)

    Interior contradiction in self-deception is clear but lacks embodied cost during climax; "breath caught" reaction to blueprint feels clinical rather than visceral. Micro-choices reveal value hierarchy only superficially during warehouse approach.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete ("throat tightened," calloused hands) and motivation rooted in preservation; lacks contradictory impulses during epiphany. Woman's appearance risks convenient resolution but "infinitely patient" trait constrains choices credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—needing to explain absences yet accepting their permanence—drive micro-choices like her quill-dance during the vision. No therapy-speak; "chest ached with lonesome splendor" embodies grief. Final renunciation of closure ("explained absences were not endings") earns cost through tactile details: moss on knees, fading thread vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction (fractured grandeur mirroring his state) and embodied emotion ("hands trembled," "tears streaming") anchor motivation, but closure lacks authentic cost—Thalos' convenient arrival negates struggle, making reawakening feel unearned rather than a true endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s embodied contradictions (firefighter vs arsonist’s daughter) shine, but Mara’s motivation lacks depth; "only friend" feels unearned. Micro-choice with the coin reveals values, yet secondary characters apply minimal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (skeptic/imagination) drive choices credibly, but final "doubted/knew" lacks tangible cost; micro-choices like trembling hands during shard insertion reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (yearning for fire vs ancestral ban) act simultaneously through embodied choices: trembling hands adjusting gear, heart aching for warmth while respecting elders. Final renunciation of fire-as-violence earned by ghost encounter and gear's calculations with visible cost in parents' scars. No label-speak; micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlow's contradictory impulses (silence vs family tradition) act simultaneously in scene; final poem choice earns shift from isolation to connection with visible cost (faded ribbon). Embodied emotion avoids labels—chisel-calloused hands, ribbon's rough texture convey grief without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority anchored in concrete details (fractured obsidian shards, warped reflection) avoids abstraction; "ethically diligent" trait remains stated not shown through action tradeoffs, limiting flaw integration.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction (blithe vs. weight of discovery) shown through micro-choices like gentle thread-touching; motivation clear but climax lacks deeper internal conflict beyond curiosity vs. duty. Final renunciation earned but cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "void she both feared and craved" and bloodshot eyes persisting through doubt, but off-page Elders prevent on-page micro-choices with opposition. Final renunciation (burning journals) earns cost through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" feels urgent yet abstract; embodied emotion strong (trembling fingers, fogged dial) but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she persists without visible struggle against her purpose. Micro-choices like clutching the scrap paper reveal values, yet flaws remain untested by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority shines through embodied choices (mask removal revealing "fatigue and resolve") but "ache pulses like a second heart" risks therapy-speak abstraction. Contradictory impulses—seeking permanence while creating impermanent art—drive credible endurance with visible cost in the unfinished portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's "rationally rebellious" motivation manifests in concrete micro-choices (clutching cog, redefining agony) with embodied contradiction—his intellectual passion wars with sewer-dwelling reality. Mara's pressure crystallizes his endurance, but "ache of understanding" borders on diagnostic label-speak, costing 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Clara's fear of lost language versus active hope, embodied via "breath caught" and micro-choices like humming to Elias. Flaw: her fear isn't sufficiently tested under pressure—she adapts too smoothly to building the choir without deeper struggle against her own doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s synesthetic gift creates embodied emotion ("taste those memories—not with her tongue"), and contradictory impulses (clinging to gentle memories vs. pruning trauma) drive micro-choices. Final renunciation of the plant’s painful past is earned through prior cuts, with visible cost in her exhaustion ("chest heaving," "legs unsteady").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction in truthfulness is vivid ("coffee tastes like regret"), but flaw doesn't create tradeoffs during climax; Voss remains opaque despite pivotal role.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation (understanding "alive" houses) drives concrete micro-choices under pressure, like arranging objects with "slow and deliberate" movements. Contradictory impulses (scientific cataloger vs. mystical believer) act simultaneously in the ritual scene. "Inadvertently profound" risks diagnosis but is redeemed by dream context and embodied cost in the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lumen’s "incisively kind" telepathy manifests through embodied contradictions (stone warmth vs. sharpness), but Mara’s emotional shift from fear to acceptance lacks messy irrationality; her grandmother’s sacrifice insight feels earned though rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in rupture moment ("obsession vs surrender"), but "balancedly daring" is diagnostic tell rather than embodied choice; flaw nearly costs 0.4 per policy though closure salvages it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied exhaustion ("fingers smudging charcoal") and contradictory hope drive the brush-handing micro-choice. Only slight abstraction in "the ache in Mr. Voss's voice" slightly mars embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction between preservation urgency and quiet hope is embodied through dough kneading and lens handling; "rosewater dread" phrasing slightly abstracts emotion but "beekeeper's absence lingered" grounds the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in "triumph and terror" as stone flares; micro-choices (frayed string analysis, mercury coil) reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of passive defiance for active creation earns cost via stone's "deeper hunger" visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) drive micro-choices under pressure, but Vey’s underdeveloped motivation and "repulsive allure" label slightly undermine embodied emotion in pivotal confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction evident in "obstacles as instruments" philosophy vs. trembling hands, but final resolution lacks sufficient emotional contradiction; "taste of salt and victory" edges toward tidy resolution without deeper cost embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's "quietly driven" trait manifests in concrete micro-choices (ignoring elders, chipping the crack) with embodied emotion ("hands trembled"), though "cold sweat broke out" edges toward cliché without sufficient novelty.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s embodied contradiction (seeking truth while distrusting anecdotes) drives choices, but Tomas lacks interiority; "noble lies" label risks diagnostic-speak yet avoids epiphany clichés through concrete negotiation artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("masking sensitivity beneath pragmatism") and embodied emotion ("thoughts roared") anchor choices; final note placement earns closure through causal chain from grandmother's inkwell to chamber discovery, though reflection near midpoint risks slight BRR overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction strong (ritual vs chaotic truth), but flaws lack compounding struggle; competence feels frictionless without inevitable mistakes. Final choice earned but cost escalation muted.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied grief ("polishing wounds into gems"), but brother's absence limits relationship crucible. Micro-choices like holding the lantern to the shadow reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. No therapy-speak despite high emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular: grief embodied as "tremor in hands" and "sound like shattered glass," avoiding therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—laughing bitterly while seeking destruction—culminating in earned closure where she becomes a "seer" with visible cost ("observatory was gone").

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's contradictory impulses (professional drone pilot vs. awe-struck seeker) manifest in micro-choices like hesitating at the lever. Her "perpetually surprised" trait informs authentic reactions but edge-world backstory lacks causal pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("helping people lie" vs. "this was different") powers the pivotal choice; embodied guilt via trembling watch and barnacle metaphor avoids label-speak; micro-choices (selecting driftwood pieces) reveal hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (regret/hope) drive Clara’s micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotions like "stomach tightened" avoid therapy-speak. Final renunciation (dropping the pull) earns cost through prior causality—her miscalculation backstory directly informs the gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interior contradiction shines: "gravitating toward safety" versus discarding the compass, with embodied emotion in "merely melancholic" laughter and pulse-mirroring needle tremor. Final choice earned through micro-choices like reinterpreting poles as "human stubbornness," avoiding over-tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak; regret manifests through concrete compass scratches.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority excels via concrete cues (baseball's signature, guilt like "ink in water"), but the empathy epiphany lacks sufficient causal friction; Mara's shift from "gravel" laughter to hope feels abrupt without layered contradiction in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (clinging to humanity vs. necessary transformation) drives the metamorphosis choice; embodied fear ("throat tighten," "voice cracked") avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of beast whisperer identity carries felt cost but micro-choices lack distinct hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines as Elara both seeks and fears maternal connection, embodied in her tracing palm on the shift while ink stains her skin. Final renunciation of cloud-bound penance feels earned through her ritual actions, though the vision's ease slightly undermines prior struggle intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (avoidance vs engagement) crystallize in the meditation chamber as Lira confronts "grief and love were not opposites but twins," earning her pivotal stitching choice. Slight abstraction in early pacifism motivation ("believed peace meant avoiding conflict") slightly weakens causality until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s interior contradiction (“fixing isn’t transformation”) manifests in embodied micro-choices (trembling hands, releasing bugs without watching). Secondary character lacks depth despite pivotal role; his fire-scarred face and abrupt vanishing feel archetypal rather than individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; Kieran's "ember" drive is told, not shown through internal struggle. No visible cost in final choice—success feels unearned despite stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "curse twisting the promise into a knot" and embodied choices like theta-rock adjustment under vision-fracture pressure; no diagnostic labels despite high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines as Kael's physical/emotional scars drive his poetic rarefaction; "masks slip" metaphor grounds abstract pain in embodied choice when he writes raw verses. Final renunciation of censorship earns cost through prior causality—his cracked gas mask mirroring vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction shines via Kael’s mechanical arm motivating his quest for "recontextualization" over answers; Elyra’s shift from "destinations" to "directions" reveals layered values under pressure. Only minor flaw: "chaos is honesty" borders on thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in molting self vs. current poet identity, but "personality fractured" risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("strategically creative" as curse) and embodied emotion ("keys that stuck like half-forgotten memories") powerfully drive her clock-fixing paralysis and final musical surrender, with micro-choices like ignoring compasses revealing authentic struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s luminous doubt versus resolve, but the dream-woman’s "fear of truth" monologue veers into thematic echo, undermining organic motivation during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s embodied apology (“words raw”) reveals contradictory impulses (blame vs longing) under pressure; Yorick’s micro-choices in stitching directly alter tactics with visible cost (years of silence confronted). Interiority avoids therapy-speak through tactile lace metaphors.
