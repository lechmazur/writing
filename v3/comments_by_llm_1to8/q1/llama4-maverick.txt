    The conjurer's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, inventive nature. Her internal state is rendered through embodied emotion, though the final epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness ("the mathematics of emotion were not a fixed quantity...").

    Emilia's characterization is concrete and embodied, with her internal conflict between caution and the need for change rendered through specific observation and micro-choices (e.g., gazing at the linden leaf).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The painter's obsession is a clear, compelling motive that drives the narrative. However, the emotional state of "haggard awe" is more told than shown through embodied contradiction in the final beats, preventing a higher score.

    Lyra's claustrophobia and adventurous spirit are established but operate more as stated traits than as contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, driven character. The reflective block, while substantial, is anchored in the present with the flute and successfully tilts her present stance, charging the final choice to play.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)

    Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("drawn to the obscure and the unknown"). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though some emotion is told ("heart pounded with excitement"). The final change is earned by on-page causality, with a visible cost in the final image of "bleak exhilaration."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation ("morbid curiosity") is clear and intensifies, but interiority relies on summary rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final change is felt, but the whispering advisor's influence blunts the protagonist's agency, making the final endurance feel slightly less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion ("her chest heaving with exertion"). Motivation is clear and consistent, though the final choice is more a culmination of observation than a high-stakes, pressured decision, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a "quietly driven" nature and a need to understand. Her embodied emotion is strong (e.g., "a shiver run down her spine"), and her final choice to step into the unknown is a credible micro-choice. However, the internal contradiction is more summarized than dramatized in-scene; we are told she feels "unease" and "dread" but don't see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emilia’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her search with professional purpose. Her emotionally rational trait is demonstrated through her methodical analysis, though her emotional embodiment in the climactic discovery is slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The surveyor's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through tactile interaction with the past. However, the interiority lacks significant contradiction or a moment of genuine struggle under pressure, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to trace origins is clear and consistent, driving her actions. However, interiority occasionally slips into abstract labels ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than concrete, embodied emotion under pressure. Her final transformation is earned through on-page struggle, but the emotional cost is more declared than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied, particularly in the handling of grief. However, the characterization lacks a moment of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in-scene, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amira's trauma and motivation are clear and embodied, particularly in the opening scene. Her shift to determined hunter is credible, though the transition lacks a deeply contradictory internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to make key on-page choices. However, interiority lacks contradiction; her "perpetually surprised" trait is stated but not dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the opening paragraph. The protagonist's guilt and motivation are clear, though her final resolve feels slightly more declared than fully earned by the prior beats of unease. The trait of manufacturing false memories is well-integrated and constrains her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The negotiator's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her handling of the drawer pull. Her motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is dramatized through her method and final success. However, her competence feels slightly unopposed; the specific internal struggle that makes her "uncommonly thoughtful" under this extreme pressure isn't fully fleshed out, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the opening lines. The "merrily melancholic" trait is a strong contradiction, though its on-page demonstration through action is somewhat limited. The final choice of endurance is earned by the causal chain of regret and the navigational shift.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her specific condition as a "clean slate seeker." Her desire to "kindle empathy" is dramatized through her actions and connection to the baseball. However, the emotional state of "jaded wonder" is more told than shown through embodied contradiction under pressure, and her competence in reading the message feels slightly convenient without a demonstrated struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra's internal conflict and paradoxical steadiness are well-embodied, particularly in the climax where her essence merges with the beasts. Aria's motivation ("reforge a bond") is clear but her characterization is more functional than deeply contradictory; she serves primarily to catalyze Lyra's change. The final choice to help feels earned by Lyra's established empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion in the handling of the saucer and hand-tracings. The final acceptance is earned through the accumulative pressure of objects and memory. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of "choking beauty" in a peak emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurora's steadfast pacifism and deep resolve are clear and consistent, compelling her high-stakes choice to engage in shadow work.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by a draw to the unusual. Her embodied emotion and micro-choice to accept the bottle feel earned. The "destitute philanthropist" trait is more stated than shown through action, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sentinel's "calmly inventive" trait is a consistent anchor, and her micro-choices under pressure (deciphering the code, activating the mechanism) are credible. However, her motivation to "spark a silent revolution" is more told than felt, and the immediate camaraderie with the revealed conspirator lacks the friction or embodied contradiction that would elevate this to a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The herder's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, precognitive nature. However, interiority leans toward summary ("sensing the weight of unfulfilled prophecies") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice is more a passive reception of a vision than an active, earned decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied contradiction ("furiously tranquil"). However, the final choice to read the letter feels more like a foregone conclusion than a high-stakes decision earned by escalating pressure; the agency is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and embodied. The mechanical arm is a compelling trait but its artificial nature is underutilized as a constraint, preventing a higher score. The final realization feels earned by the journey's dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong interiority and a clear, embodied sense of purpose. The final choice to rebuild is motivated by the reflective block about the prison friend, which anchors in the present and alters stance. The "molting personalities" attribute is stated but not dramatized on the page, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pianist's wistful melancholy is embodied and consistent, driving her to seek refuge. Her "strategically creative" trait is shown, not told, through her manipulation of the film reel. However, the final transition to hopeful determination, while thematically fitting, feels slightly abrupt, lacking a micro-choice to fully dramatize the internal shift from sorrow to steely resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative. However, the "empirically whimsical" trait is stated rather than shown through concrete, contradictory actions under pressure, limiting interior complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaito's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in his interaction with the compass and the lace-making. His emotional progression from sorrow to peace is realistic and earned through the ritual. However, a minor reliance on told emotion ("feeling a sense of peace") slightly abstracts the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maria’s motives are clear (cleanup, curiosity, demystifying drama) and her interior lens is consistent, but her emotional life remains abstract and minimally embodied. Micro-choices are slight (collecting dust, continued examination) and face little pressure. Contradictory impulses rarely spark on the page, so change feels more affirmed than earned. The closing humility reads true but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist’s motive (decode legacy, find purpose in stillness) is clear, but her interiority leans on abstractions rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (unrolling the ledger, deciding to retrace), yet they carry little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, specific motivation (translating silence into music) and embodied emotion are present, with a credible collaborative bond with Eli. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are light; the survivor’s nerves smooth quickly without a sharp choice under pressure. The relationship deepens but doesn’t truly force a risky trade‑off. Actions align with motives and reveal character, though stakes remain gently held.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear motive (“to give rest a permanent address”) and a consistent melancholy temperament, but the stubborn trait is mostly labeled, not dramatized under pressure. Micro-choices are summarized rather than staged, so internal contradiction never truly bites. His endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis but the cost of renunciation is implied, not embodied. Stronger embodied conflict during the device repair would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Akira’s motivation is clear and steady, but she reads as uniformly noble with little contradiction or cost on the page. Her “gently persistent” trait is told and back-referenced rather than tested in scene. Micro-choices (ringing the bell, declaring resolve, circulating afterward) show care but not pressure. The result is credible but safe characterization without a live crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s motives (spiritual curiosity, longing to locate “unused love”) are clear, and her micro‑choice to trust the pilgrim leads to the breath work.

The closing stance shift is earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motivation (unlocking the fragment, “texture of time”) is clear and consistent, with embodied tremor between curiosity and trepidation. However, interior conflict remains mostly told rather than dramatized through pressured micro‑choices. The key choices—touching the fragment, continuing, then claiming it—lack palpable cost. Character specificity (hedge‑maze craft) colors perception but rarely constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is clear (recover and share resilient seeds), but interiority is generic and low-contrast, with little embodied conflict or contradictory impulse on the page. Key choices (decoding, infiltration, distribution) read competent and frictionless rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lyra’s motive—to capture “the sound of trust breaking” to heal others—is clear and consistently tied to her craft. Interiority is particular (hearing colors, absences collected), though conflict is mostly internal and low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lumina’s motive (to capture “illuminated moments” and follow cryptic signals) is clear but largely untested, yielding little contradiction or cost. Interiority leans into generalized awe rather than character‑specific texture. Decoding the bouquet and pocketing the jar are choices, yet they come easily and reveal limited conflict. The piece ends without a meaningful renunciation or earned fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elian’s interiority is present and character‑particular in craft details, but contradictory impulses (fear of leaving vs. drive to venture) are stated rather than dramatized under pressure. The emotional thaw is told more than tested. Micro‑choices (narrating tasks, shaping the orb) reveal temperament but not real cost. The final resolve reads sincere yet low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent, but heavily labeled (“phobia-ridden,” “firmly adaptive,” “prove vulnerability is power”) rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The inner conflict rarely plays simultaneously on the page; fear doesn’t perceptibly deform tactics beyond summary. The stunt-double identity never pressures an on‑page choice in the scene. The closing decision to “step out of the shadows” lands, but with minimal embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear want (to “draw a map of the endless night”) and a method-driven temperament (“mildly obsessed with listening to the silence”) read consistently, but pressure is low and contradictory impulses are thin. Agency centers on attention rather than contested choice. The walk into darkness is a choice, yet it carries little felt cost or internal friction. Interiority is atmospheric rather than revealing layered, character-specific conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (curiosity about the origin of thoughts) and consistent, but internal conflict is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Zeta’s “remarkably composed” nature flattens pressure rather than complicating choices. The realization at the end is earned by pattern, but the cost of that understanding is not felt on the page. Moments like the shattered violin reside in summary, not in embodied, pressured action.

    Motivation (thaw mistrust with transparency) is explicit and consistent, but interiority leans generic and declarative rather than character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dresser’s devotion and pragmatism read clearly, but internal contradiction and on‑page micro‑choices are minimal. Motivation is declared (“to prove that gardens know their gardeners”) rather than tested under pressure. The ritual of polishing marbles reveals character, yet no beat forces a costly choice. Change registers as endurance more than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelin’s goal (prove time moves sideways) is clear and her choices (repair, flip, touch, return) align, but interiority leans on generic awe and lacks contradictory impulses beyond a brief hesitation. “Mechanically warm hands” hints at specificity but never constrains or complicates action. Her newfound purpose at the end is earned but comes without visible personal cost. The absence of a second on‑page character limits crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rachel’s motive—to decode the maestro’s hidden message—reads clear and consistent, and her micro‑choice to “disrupt the tranquility” gives her agency. However, internal contradiction is thin; fear for her instrument or ambivalence about trespassing the ghost’s domain never materializes. Emotions lean toward summary (“she felt a surge of inspiration”) over embodied specificity. The final shift to peace is earned but low‑cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s motive—to surface a “swallowed truth”—is clear and consistent, and her method (smudging margins, poring over data) reveals a particular temperament. The internal turn from seeking certainties to accepting provisionality lands credibly with a felt cost (“auroral sorrow”). However, interior conflict remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in actionable dilemmas. The absence of on‑page interpersonal pressure limits the character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation (to uncover a “swallowed truth”) is clear and sustained, and the skeptic vs. eeriness tension gives a mild internal countercurrent. However, contradictory impulses never truly collide on the page; the explorer moves forward without visible cost or hesitation. Interiority leans into labeled states (“drowsy alertness”) over character‑particular texture. The closing satisfaction arrives quickly, feeling minimally earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear motive (to witness without judgment) and one decisive act (setting aside the quill to burrow) give minimal arc, but internal contradiction is lightly dramatized rather than embodied. “Grips reality loosely” is asserted more than tested, yielding low-tension choices. Emotional texture skews declarative and detached, muting cost. The endurance at the end reads, but the price (losing the above-world tie) is mostly told.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aria’s motive—using music to link Eli to “ordinary magic”—is clear and consistent, and her choice to adjust the melody at the eclipse serves her goal. However, internal contradiction and embodied cost are minimal; she rarely wrestles with competing impulses. Eli remains a reactive presence without pressure back on Aria. The result is warm but low-friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.0)
    Emilia’s motive—an odd historian drawn to “stories the walls had heard”—is clear and steady, but she faces little internal contradiction or visible cost. Her choices (examining the tapestry, reading diaries, leaving with “completion”) are coherent yet frictionless. Interiority leans on summary (“attuned,” “determined”) more than distinct, embodied paradox. The final sense of completion is earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Oracle’s motives and contradictions are stated rather than dramatized; we’re told of an “accidentally prophetic nature” and a desire to “transpose” life, but we don’t see a pressured, embodied choice. Interiority leans on abstract declarations (“open secrets,” “new key”) instead of concrete impulses in conflict. The decision to “orchestrate” the meeting lacks visible cost or resistance. The stranger exerts little specific pressure, so relationship dynamics never become a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (avert possession, illuminate assumptions), but interiority stays abstract and generalized. We rarely see embodied, character‑particular feeling or contradictory impulses under pressure. Choices feel procedural rather than compelled by escalating inner conflict. The final serenity lacks a visible personal cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (seize inspiration, become “conductor of unheard symphonies”) and embodied through the mapping ritual, but contradictory impulses and on‑page micro‑choices under pressure are thin. Emotional texture leans abstract (“chronologically homesick,” “upturned hush”) rather than concrete embodiments of stress. The only real counter‑force is time/exhaustion, which remains conceptual. As a result, the final resolve reads more declared than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (conquer the labyrinth of self) but interiority remains generalized and nearly frictionless; we get resolve without contradictory impulses. The “periodically eternal” trait never forces a trade‑off on the page. Encounters with “echoes” are summarized rather than dramatized, so struggle reads abstract. The final transformation feels granted rather than earned via concrete micro‑choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s goal—to thaw emotional numbness through tactile music—is clear and consistent, and her embodied touch on drums gives some specificity. However, there are few pressured micro-choices or contradictory impulses; she mostly continues a meditative regimen without a live trade-off. The humming intensification implies a stance but not a costly decision. Strong interior texture, limited on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    Curiosity versus caution gives her a credible internal friction, and small micro‑choices (removing the tube, deciding to keep the discovery close) track with “meticulous” and solitary integrity. However, emotions are often summarized rather than embodied, and epiphany (“a sense of clarity washed over her”) arrives with little on‑page struggle. The “credibly curious” phrasing reads label‑like. The final resolve is believable but relatively low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive (grief mediated through scent) is clear and consistent, and the vial anchors her interior. However, conflict is largely one‑note and the epiphany lands tidily without a sharp contradictory pull. The “lantern broker” facet never pressures choices, remaining decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear motivation (to “discover the texture of time”) and a tactile method (stone‑patterning) give her coherence, but internal contradiction is minimal and cost is soft. The rope affinity hints at a shadow want, yet it never pressures a concrete choice. Micro‑choices exist (arranging stones, staying through the night) but none force a trade‑off. The ending’s “understanding” reads earned in mood, not in conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Her drive—to find beauty in the unfinished—reads clearly and governs her choices (taking the bowl, entering, playing). Interiority is mostly externalized through sensory focus rather than contradiction under pressure; we rarely feel competing impulses. The elderly woman’s beckoning offers a small relational crucible, but conflict remains gentle. The closing acceptance feels earned, if relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dealer’s motives (precision, empathy without immersion) are clear and consistent, and her “affectionate detachment” is a credible operating stance. However, internal contradiction is stated more than dramatized; she “subsume[s] her own emotions” without a felt struggle on the page. Micro-choices under pressure are minimal, and no relationship crucible appears. The ending’s endurance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear, consistent motives (curiosity, community‑mindedness) but little interior contradiction or pressure; Lena makes kind choices without cost. Sophia remains an outline beyond “kind librarian” and “late husband.” The relationship forms quickly with no friction to test character. Emotional embodiment leans generic rather than character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kael’s desire to belong is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction and micro‑choices under pressure are thin; the decision to “dedicate” arrives with little friction.

The final belonging reads earned enough for a quiet piece, but at low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lyra’s goal and temperament are clear, and her micro‑choices (closing eyes, working the spell, stopping when the giant stirs) align with that drive. However, interior conflict is mild and largely unopposed; she encounters little friction or contradictory impulse on the page. Emotional texture leans generic at times (“deep sense of connection”), softening specificity. The final renunciation (returning as the nap ends) carries minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (to probe the “mathematics of emotion”), but interior conflict remains generalized; “ambiguous loss” is named rather than dramatized through a concrete, character‑specific memory or mistake. The conjurer’s agency is mostly ritual attention rather than pressured choice, so we see few micro‑tradeoffs under stress. Still, her methodical ritual and fixation on the glass eyes reveal a credible, particular mind. The final quiet renunciation of certainty reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dweller’s gentle, methodical care and desire to be seen are clear and embodied through tactile work, smell-triggered memory, and curated caches. The internal tension—wanting visibility yet choosing concealment—registers but remains low-pressure. Micro-choices (pocketing the tape, arranging a “world of wonder,” melting back) align with motive. The cost of continued invisibility is implied rather than dramatized under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.0)
    Emilia’s longing for change versus her cautious temperament is clear, but rendered largely in summary rather than dramatized micro‑choices. The decisive move—choosing to “release control”—comes without an on‑page test or visible loss. Emotional texture feels generalized, with little embodiment beyond calm imagery. The arc lands, but the cost reads conceptual rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (to make meaning of trauma via the brooch), and the unease at bartering art shows a flicker of contradiction. However, interiority leans generic and declarative, with little embodied emotion or specific, pressured micro‑choices. The stranger scene lacks on‑page tension to expose deeper flaws or values hierarchy. The final “closure” is acceptance rather than a felt renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.7)
    Aria reads as an archetype with clear curiosity but minimal contradiction or embodied cost. Her key choice—delving deeper to attune—faces no real resistance, and the pilgrim offers no on‑page pressure. Interiority leans abstract (“unseen forces,” “bright darkness”) over character‑particular texture. The final stance feels earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clear motive (compile fragments; hearten community) and a consistent worldview, but interiority stays abstract and mostly told. Little contradictory impulse under pressure; the plan unfolds without meaningful friction. The shopkeeper’s brief presence does not create relational pressure. Actions align, but cost and embodied emotion are thin.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (seek the fortress of unspoken truths), but interior conflict is thin and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Micro‑choices exist (picking up the punch, following the arrows, stepping into the light) yet none carry visible cost or contradictory impulse. Emotional states are told (“trembling certainty”) more than embodied. The final transformation reads declared rather than earned by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Emilia’s motives (skeptic drawn to decode the tile) are clear, but internal contradiction and cost are minimal. Her “courageously kind determination” is told rather than dramatized under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (searching, transcribing), yet they never force a trade‑off. The end registers a gentle reorientation rather than an earned, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s boredom and curiosity credibly drive action, and the moment he reaches to touch his duplicate hints at risk and tenderness. However, internal contradiction is light—he moves smoothly from intrigue to mastery with little friction or degradation under pressure. Embodied emotion leans abstract (“dimensional awareness,” “sense of awe”) rather than specific felt sensation. The change reads as a conceptual reframe more than a hard‑won emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lena’s motives and legacy conflict (con artist father vs “justice”/fair trade) are clear and character‑particular, and the ink pot reveals her attention and temperament. However, conflicting impulses rarely clash in action; most tension lives in her thoughts and in declared readiness. The father’s “You’re a natural” lands a bit conveniently, easing pressure rather than testing her. We get credible interiority, but the decisive micro‑choice is deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent—she collects “textures”—but internal contradiction and pressure are minimal. Her micro-choices (when to chart, when to stop, where to pause) never test her values or force a tradeoff. Emotions are largely told via reverent observation rather than embodied conflict. The final stance (satisfied continuation) doesn’t foreclose a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.0)
    Clear motive (reconstruct erased histories) but little embodied interiority or contradictory impulse; the “nameless” stance reduces friction rather than creating it. Micro‑choices are minimal beyond taking the label and moving on. Emotional texture is summarized rather than dramatized. The end registers comprehension, not a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (decode the universal riddle) and actions align (shell, cello, retelling), but interior contradiction is thin; “gloomy cheerfulness” repeats without sharpening competing impulses. She encounters little resistance, so we see limited micro‑choices under pressure. The triumph registers, yet with minimal visible cost or renunciation, the change feels somewhat unearned emotionally. Embodiment is decent (wind, vibration) but leans on reiterated labels over idiosyncratic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    Ava’s motives are clear but largely told as labels (“culture shock absorber,” “orderly intuitive”) with little embodied interiority or contradictory impulse on the page. Her risk is asserted but not dramatized through specific choices that cost her. The most concrete action—encoding graffiti—reveals competence but not a pressured internal conflict. The arc resolves into communal readiness without testing Ava’s limits in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motive (document the last flora) is clear and steady, but internal contradiction and micro‑choices under pressure are thin. Her curiosity about the sand grain gives a small, revealing beat, yet no real cost accrues from it. Emotional texture leans generic (“fragility,” “preciousness”) rather than character‑particular. The endurance at the end reads more told than lived, reducing the felt change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    Emilia’s motive—to make the hummingbird fly true—is clear and consistently pursued through tactile calibration and programming tweaks. Her blindness colors method but rarely imposes cost, and internal conflict is minimal to nonexistent. The competence-forward portrayal flattens tension, though the tactile, vibration-guided work offers specificity. The final touch on the drone reads earned but emotionally untested.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Emilia’s drive is clear and consistent, and we glimpse a credible tension between urgency and trepidation at the lake’s edge. However, “dry‑witted” and “subtly confident” are mostly labels rather than dramatized behaviors. The deciphering beat lacks embodied struggle, softening the sense of competence under pressure. Her final step onto the ice reads as a motivated choice with modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tuner’s motive—restore balance—is clear and aligned with action, but interiority stays archetypal and conflict‑light. There’s little contradictory impulse or costed choice beyond patient endurance. The piece favors ritual over psychology, leaving character change minimal. The endurance through the night hints at cost but doesn’t foreground a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s motive (preserve the temple’s memories) is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans generic and repeats key phrases rather than exposing contradictory impulses under pressure. The brief nod to loved ones left behind offers a flicker of conflict that isn’t developed into choice. Micro-choices are mostly procedural (“unsnarl,” “focus”) rather than value-testing. The cost lands at the end (melancholy at the temple’s silence) but the earning feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.3)
    The boy’s motive—“to thread the labyrinth with his own story”—is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction and micro-choices are thin. He pushes a door, walks, touches a lock, and resolves to continue; none force a trade-off or reveal layered values. Emotions are largely summarized rather than embodied. Legacy pressure is stated but not dramatized into a concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivations are clear (alchemist seeks awakening; ghost repays a debt), but interior contradiction and micro‑choices are minimal beyond “she reaches for the bead.” Emotional states are often told rather than dramatized, with little friction or competing impulses. The relationship dynamic is evocative yet largely declarative. The cost (ghost fading) lands but with limited on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she faces little oppositional pressure and makes few micro‑choices under stress. Interiority leans declarative (“hauntingly optimistic vision”) rather than embodying contradictory impulses in scene. The completion of the tapestry reads as persistence rather than a pressured, high‑cost choice. Emotional cost is gestured at (“weight of her task”) without a concrete trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya’s motive—to restore heritage and faith—is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the sundial base adds credibility. However, internal contradiction is minimal; curiosity never meets meaningful resistance. Micro-choices (kneeling, brushing, documenting) feel procedural rather than pressured. The final shift reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    Cipher’s motive (to craft and send an encoded letter) is clear, but there’s little internal contradiction or pressure altering their stance. Emotions are largely summarized (anticipation, peace, satisfaction) rather than embodied under strain. Micro‑choices exist (method, transcription, sealing) but face no meaningful opposition. The final satisfaction feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (to “listen for unheard stories” and preempt a coup), and competence reads credibly, but interior conflict is thin and mostly asserted urgency. Emotional texture leans abstract; we rarely see embodied contradiction under pressure. The persona of “disguised wisdom” is stated rather than dramatized through costly choices. The final stance (charged readiness) is believable but not hard‑earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s motive—uncovering the truth of the unsent letters at the charged threshold before choice—is clear and her actions align with it. Interiority is textured but generalized; contradictory impulses (fierce/tender, compulsion/hesitation) are implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The confrontation with the manifestation shows compassion under pressure, but the cost to her is largely atmospheric. The final renunciation/acceptance reads earned but not harrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s interiority is present and coherent—her translator’s eye applied to the cast is a concrete, character-specific move—but her emotional range remains narrow and often summarized by abstractions (“anxieties,” “lotus-hearted ache”). Motivation (to “graft new meaning onto old wounds”) is clear yet repeats rather than compounds under pressure. We glimpse contradiction (pressing on as anesthetic takes hold), but the cost and stakes of that choice stay soft. No relationship crucible is on the page, limiting dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (to rekindle joy through creation), and small choices (pocketing the fragment, deciding to display the mural in situ) align. Interiority is mostly told rather than dramatized, with minimal contradictory impulses under pressure. The emotional turn lands, but at low heat, without a visible cost beyond relinquishing the work to the fog. Stronger on devotion than on conflict-driven self-revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s motive—trading the stifling certainty of mastery for curiosity—is clear and embodied in her micro‑choices (repositioning mirrors, trusting the nickel’s “pulse”). Interiority is grounded in tactile details (humming, pigment, mirrors) rather than labels. However, the cost of her shift is faint; the change lands but feels largely triumphant. A deeper contradiction under pressure (risking the mural’s integrity) would sharpen character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyra’s motive (evading the thoughts tax and guarding a “spark of defiance”) is clear, but her interiority stays generic and largely summarized. Actions—planting patterns, tending plots—lack embodied pressure or contradictory impulses in scene. No relationship crucible appears on the page to force harder choices. The ending frames legacy without a visible cost that tests her character.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (transmuting pain into beauty), and her actions—singing, then writing—align. However, internal contradiction is light; we’re told of centuries of longing but see little on‑page friction or competing impulses under pressure. The restful turn feels earned but low‑cost. Embodied detail (fungi glow, wind) helps but emotions skew summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (preserving forgotten names) and actions align (tending, singing), but interior conflict is limited and largely summarized as “foxglove regret.” The piece rarely forces contradictory impulses into contact on the page. Loneliness and devotion register as cost, yet no micro‑choice truly tests her values. The ending’s endurance reads earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation (to restore trust after a prior misread) is clear and sustained, and her cautious exuberance versus fear offers a mild internal tension. Interiority is often abstract (“symphonies of truth”) rather than vividly embodied under pressure. The change—she regains self‑trust and steps into the corridor—lands, but the cost is light and mostly retrospective. Specific micro‑choices beyond steady transcription are scarce.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelin’s motive (harmonize preservation and safety) is clear, but pressure never forces contradictory impulses to collide on the page. Interiority leans on generalities (“compassion and unity”) rather than revealing character‑particular flaws or blind spots. Her “resolve” arrives without earned cost or a choice that forecloses an option. Competence and wonder dominate; genuine struggle is largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Emilia’s contradiction—craving connection while guarding secrecy—reads clearly through her ritual and meticulous “paper trails.” However, her motives are affirmed rather than tested; no on‑page pressure forces a costly choice. Embodied texture (dust motes, pigeon handling) grounds emotion but seldom collides with consequence. The closing poise feels earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear desire and a consistent inner lens, but the interiority leans abstract and tidy rather than conflicted; contradictory impulses rarely act in-scene. The reunion with the father reads emotionally apt yet lightly earned, with minimal on‑page struggle. Embodied emotion is present (“light danced,” “scent of blooming flowers”) but not harnessed to a pressured micro‑choice. Overall, motivation drives attention rather than forcing costly decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is explicit (seeking a “rhythm of belonging”), but interiority stays abstract and unconflicted; few micro-choices under pressure beyond picking up the feather and breathing. The astrologer’s “softly ingenious” nature is told rather than dramatized. Emotional contradictions and embodied reactions are minimal. The final acceptance lands without a visible cost that tests character.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear desire and consistent pursuit, but interiority leans generic and conflict-light. Micro-choices (following seeds, trusting the hum, deciphering symbols) are present yet largely unopposed. “Cheerful gloom” hints at contradiction without dramatized friction. The final understanding arrives smoothly, with little visible cost to earn a deeper change.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elian’s motive (to blend probability into wonder) is clear, but he faces no real friction; his interiority remains serene and untested. The “lightly attentive” stance never constrains a choice under pressure. The bishop’s weight “as if it held secrets” hints at a deeper conflict but never forces a trade‑off. No visible cost accompanies his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s motive—to “pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin”—is clear and sustained, but she faces little internal contradiction or real resistance. The “anchored hand” registers as omen more than constraint, so pressure on her micro‑choices stays low. The shift from exile to purposeful departure is credible but largely asserted. Embodied detail (bare feet, night scent) helps but doesn’t complicate her psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.6)
    Interiority is present but generalized; she yearns to “commune” and “illuminate value” without a sharp, character‑specific contradiction. The one external nudge—the fisherman’s stone—elicits contemplation rather than a pressured choice. Her late “urgency” to capture the moment is a stance, not a high‑cost decision. Little embodied emotion beyond stock calm/peace keeps her from reading as singular.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael’s interiority is present and coherent—scarred, duty-driven, skeptical yet drawn to the box—but micro-choices are thin beyond opening the box and reframing his purpose. The hardness/softness tension is named more than dramatized. His shift to “messenger” reads as a stance change but lacks on‑page cost. Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied in pressured action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motive (“puzzle out new equations for hope”) is clear and her meditative arranging shows character, but interiority leans abstract and generalized. Contradictory impulses surface briefly (exhilaration and terror at the precipice) yet don’t force a concrete trade‑off. Embodied emotion is light—much is told rather than shown under pressure. The final stance (“on the right path”) feels earned enough but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to decode the estate’s secrets) but little embodied struggle or contradictory impulse on the page. Interiority is generalized rather than character-particular, with minimal micro-choices under pressure. The “sensitively perceptive” trait is told more than dramatized. The closing acceptance reads as an earned stance shift but without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (unlock the mirrors) and actions align (painting, humming), but there’s little internal contradiction or embodied cost. The “perceptively calm” trait never strains against doubt or fear. Emotional texture stays generalized (“sense of wonder,” “excitement”) rather than character‑particular. The final acceptance feels unopposed, so change reads unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian’s motivation is clear, but his interiority leans on generic abstractions (“price of redemption”) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. We’re told his gentleness soothes delegates, yet we don’t witness concrete micro‑choices or a costlier trade‑off. The clipboard’s significance reveals something about him, but mostly as stated theme, not dramatized behavior. The ending’s “measure of peace” feels earned emotionally but not through visible struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist’s motive (restore a diverted watershed to preserve beauty) is clear and consistent, and the egg gives her a specific, embodied tether. The “amoral but secretly sentimental” contradiction is present but mostly told rather than dramatized under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (walking into the flat, raising the egg, triggering the release) but face little resistance, so the internal cost reads light. The closing endurance/stance feels earned but not deeply paid-for.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (seeking solace/defying conformity) and her choice to “untangle the threads” produces change, but interiority remains abstract and largely declarative. Contradictory impulses are lightly sketched (bittersweet echoes) rather than dramatized in embodied, moment-by-moment pressure. The “bodily poetic” trait reads label-like and doesn’t shape tactics. The transformation convinces conceptually, but the felt cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is clear (to probe ethics via storytelling), but interior conflict and micro-choices under pressure are thin. Emotions are mostly summarized (“soothe her frayed nerves”) rather than embodied. The arc is a gentle recommitment rather than a costly change, limiting depth. Actions (setting up, writing, packing) don’t expose contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—is clear and consistent, and her actions (knotting, signaling, leaving) align with it. However, interiority is generalized and conflict-light, with few contradictory impulses or embodied costs. The “esoteric realist” label isn’t dramatized through specific choices under pressure. The final sense of resolve reads serene rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    Akira’s motive—preserving the sound of forgotten names—is clear and consistently tied to her temperament (“technically gentle”). However, there is little on‑page contradiction or pressure testing that trait; she proceeds undeterred with minimal internal friction. The forgiveness backstory gives dimension but doesn’t complicate the present choice. Change at the end reads as fulfillment rather than a costly pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.7)
    Hindsight’s desire is stated and consistent, but interiority stays abstract and largely declarative. The dream decision is the only choice under pressure, and it carries little visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse, with repeated conceptual phrasing substituting for felt contradiction. The final acceptance reads more like posture than a tested renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is clear (decipher tile, seal covenant), but interior conflict remains abstract and tidy; the “empirically ironic” stance never creates on‑page friction. Micro‑choices are thin beyond raising the tile and “deciphering.” Emotions are told rather than embodied, and the final surrender reads as unopposed fulfillment rather than a costly trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s pacifist motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is idealized and largely untested. She encounters no credible resistance and pays no visible cost, so the change reads frictionless. The “scheming” trait is gestured at rather than dramatized. Her persuasion feels more like a foregone conclusion than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear (capture the runaway dream) and actions align (claiming the sextant, breathing practice, crafting, then stepping through). Interiority is largely declarative and idealized, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The “firmly grounded” moment with the sextant hints at tension but isn’t tested before she vanishes. The final renunciation (leaving the world) lands, but the cost isn’t wrestled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motive (to heal and bridge generations) is clear and consistent, and her small choices (tying the ribbon, planting forgotten seeds) align. However, interiority is summarized rather than dramatized, with little contradictory impulse on the page. The reunion with Aria arrives without visible pressure testing Elara’s flaws or resolve. Emotional cost is implied more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The curator’s curiosity drives choices (following the humming, entering the bathroom, picking up the stone, accepting the book), but interior conflict is thin and largely summarized as “disquiet.” Emotions are mostly labeled rather than embodied, and the “breakthrough” reads as told rather than dramatized. The shift to purpose at the end is credible but lightly earned. Secondary figures apply minimal direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear (find the hidden library, help the traveler) and consistent, but interiority is generalized and largely told rather than dramatized. “Carefully resourceful” mostly stays as a label; few embodied micro-choices under pressure. The relationship dynamic is summarized rather than tested in scene, so trust and renegotiation lack bite. The closing change in purpose feels asserted more than earned through contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s goal is clear, but her interiority leans on labels (“chimera twin discoverer,” “blissfully aberrant”) rather than dramatized contradiction or embodied stress. She reads, senses, realizes—few micro‑choices under pressure test her values. The flirtation with being “lost in the labyrinthine corridors of her own mind” doesn’t produce a concrete cost or choice. Actions align with motives, but growth/endurance at the end feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    Emilia’s curiosity and drive “to translate confusion into clarity” are clear, with a few embodied beats (hairs lifting, shared focus with the professor). However, internal contradiction is minimal and the shift reads as a largely tidy epiphany. The professor’s agency often leads, leaving Emilia reactive until the touch of the rope. Change is present but the cost to her is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (restore harmony), but internal contradiction and cost are minimal, yielding a largely untroubled competence arc. The mapkeeper’s method and attention offer specificity, yet her emotional texture stays generalized (“driven by a deep motivation”) rather than embodied or conflicted. Micro-choices (study cracks, conjure hush) occur, but without visible stakes if she fails. The resolution grants fulfillment without a felt trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear motive (rekindle knowledge; find meaning in coincidences) and a few micro‑choices (touching the prism, then the orrery) land, but internal contradiction is thin and largely told. Emotions skew generalized (“a surge of determination/excitement”) rather than embodied specifics under pressure. The repeated clutching of the shard labels importance without revealing conflicted impulses or cost. We end with resolve, but no path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear motive (to shape identity and guard memory) and a few micro‑choices (descend, touch crystal, accept the flood) register, but internal contradiction is minimal. Emotions skew abstract (“weight of her task,” “sense of peace”) rather than embodied under pressure. The shift from burden to peace is asserted more than dramatized, softening felt cost. Still, the POV remains coherent and character‑particular in noticing storms, stone, and shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clear want (recover inspiration) and a stable interior lens, but the emotions are largely told in generic terms (“hopelessness,” “ambient awareness”) with little embodied contradiction. Micro‑choices are minimal beyond strolling, watching, and reading the mosaic note. The renewal reads credible but low‑pressure, without a visible price or renunciation. The fire‑spinner and note reveal more about theme than Lyra under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clear motive and a stable sensibility, but almost no micro-choices under pressure or contradictory impulses; she watches rather than acts. The “warmly observant” trait is shown, yet without a visible cost or tested value. The relationship pressure with the two figures remains abstract, limiting character revelation. The end’s calm “clarity” lacks earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and particular (collecting “flavors of silences” to ease claustrophobia), with a credible contradictory mix of excitement and dread. The key on‑page micro‑choices—releasing the doll and choosing to attend to the hush—fit the character. Interiority leans told rather than embodied at peak beats, and the change lands a bit tidy. The father’s presence reads as supportive context rather than active crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent (she aims “to teach silence how to comfort”), but internal conflict is minimal and largely untested. Her competence glides unimpeded; there’s no moment where contradictory impulses force a choice. Embodied emotion is present in the listening and the storm glass attention, but feels generalized. The final acceptance of “earned stasis” lacks a visible cost tied to her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Aria’s motive (claim the throne, restore Xylophia‑IV) is clear, but interior conflict is minimal and nearly every challenge yields without resistance. Her “wisely adventurous” trait appears in cautious peeling and urgency before sunrise, yet we don’t see a tradeoff or credible doubt under pressure. Embodied emotion is mostly generalized awe rather than contradictory impulses. The decisive choice to sit the throne lands but lacks a felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (preserve/revive the sanctuary, end isolation), but interiority leans abstract over embodied specificity. The trait “burns bridges carefully” is told, not dramatized in a pressured choice. The final shift—choosing to step forward—lands but with soft, low-cost ambiguity. Emotional contradiction is gestured at (“loaded emptiness”) rather than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lyra’s motive is clear (curiosity + lab work), but her interiority is thin and largely summarized; contradictory impulses under pressure rarely materialize. The “virtuously mischievous” trait is stated but seldom constrains a choice or exacts a cost. The climax grants her success without visible sacrifice, muting the sense of earned change. Distinctive behavioral tells beyond grins and generic wonder are scarce.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    Interiority is thin and generic despite vivid atmosphere; the “dynasty ender” remains a title rather than a person with contradictions or costs. Actions—turning the crank, receiving visions, leaving—lack friction or trade‑offs that reveal hierarchy of values. The label “eloquently silent” isn’t dramatized into constraint or price. The final certainty (“would change the course of history”) reads unearned by on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.0)
    The knight’s want (to “capture the shape of possibility”) is clear, but the leap from a name on a program to sworn allegiance lacks dramatized inner conflict. “Withdrawn” to “purposeful conduit” is asserted more than contested; contradictory impulses barely spark. Micro-choices (unsnapping, chanting, reaching) align with the aim but feel frictionless. Cost to personality or worldview is not meaningfully staged.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    Emilia’s motivation (to preserve and magnify forgotten kindnesses) is clear and consistent, but her inner conflict is muted and largely summarized. We don’t see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure; her shift from broken-hearted to purposeful feels asserted more than dramatized. The final stance (guardian of memories) lands, but the visible cost is soft. Embodied emotion is thin beyond the generalized “musty despair” and a swelling heart.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motivation (resisting erasure) is clear and consistent, and the decision to “reappear” gives her at least one concrete choice. However, interiority leans abstract and declarative, with little contradictory impulse or embodied cost beyond stated risk. Micro-choices in scene are sparse; the gathering unfolds without pressure that reveals new facets. The final endurance (“held the line, for now”) reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is explicit—she plays to hush the prophecy—but interiority is generalized and largely summarized by narrator rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Micro-choices under pressure are minimal beyond “keep playing/whispering.” There’s no felt cost or meaningful renunciation; the smile and disappearance read tidy. Strong image, thin psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear desire (decode the leaves) and a few micro‑choices (prodding the speck; building a tiny monument), but interior conflict is thin and largely untested. Emotions are expressed in generalized, decorative terms (“mossy delight”) rather than embodied contradiction. The “emerges transformed” beat reads asserted more than earned, with limited felt cost. Still, actions align with her orderly, reverent temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s motives (repairing time, then choosing to “befriend uncertainty”) are clear but largely asserted rather than tested under pressure. Interiority leans abstract, with minimal contradictory impulses on the page and few micro‑choices beyond moving, picking up, and building. The “epiphany” arrives smoothly without visible struggle or cost. Hands‑on craft detail helps but doesn’t deepen conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motives (disillusionment → self‑redemption) are clear, but they remain abstract and largely declared. Interiority leans on repeated concepts (“weight of names,” “luminous regret”) rather than contradictory impulses enacted under pressure. The final acceptance reads emotionally coherent but lightly earned because few micro‑choices are dramatized. Actions (picking up the coin, starting an experiment) don’t materially test her.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    The collector’s compassion and steadiness read clearly, with concrete micro-choices (following the light, humming a counterpoint) but little contradictory impulse under pressure. Interiority leans generic (“modestly fearless,” “sense of purpose fulfilled”) rather than character-particular. The young woman’s presence adds minimal relational friction. The final endurance—continuing the work—carries scant on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (healing via “mathematics of mercy”) and consistent, but interiority leans on labels (“trauma responses”) and summary over idiosyncratic embodiment. The relationship with Arin offers minimal pressure and quick acquiescence, softening conflict. Elara’s decisive acts (straining free, entering the forest) align with her motive, yet the final realization feels told rather than earned through specific on‑page struggle. The cost registers, but faintly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lena’s motive crystallizes (to honor overlooked histories) and aligns with her choices (buying the lens, committing to unfasten anchors), but internal contradiction and embodied cost are thin. The vendor’s one line adds a faint relational spark, yet no on‑page pressure tests Lena. Emotions skew abstract (“eternal instant,” “anchors of intuition”) rather than somatically felt. The final resolve reads principled but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ezra’s motive—compelled to uncover what places hide—reads clear and consistent, and small micro‑choices (touching the barrel, reading the logbook, taking the barrel) align with that drive. Internal contradiction is limited; she rarely struggles or pays a felt price beyond a stated “weightless burden.” Embodied perception is strong (dust, light, metal), but emotional texture tends toward summary rather than conflicted impulses. The final stance (carrying stories as purpose) is credible but lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The operator’s motivation (compress eternity) is clear, but interiority is archetypal and conflict-free. Choices—opening the bottle, printing frost patterns—are purposeful yet low in personal cost. Emotion is reported via ambiance rather than embodied contradiction. The ending shows resolve without a credible renunciation or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clear desire and vocation shift (revolutionary to chronicler) are legible, with small micro-choices (retrieving the shard, working through the storm). Internal conflict is muted; “burnished sorrow” is declared more than dramatized, and contradictory impulses rarely operate simultaneously. The final renunciation of the fighter identity reads, but its cost is conceptual rather than felt in a pressured moment. Overall motivated, but low struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.6)
    Erebus’s motive (to restore hidden music/light) is clear and consistent, and his competence reads credibly. However, interior conflict is minimal; the piece offers little contradiction or cost within his psyche. Micro-choices (the reverent pacing, the final turn of a screw) exist but face scant pressure. The ending alters nothing in his character beyond satisfaction, limiting felt transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (following the compass to seek “where explanations fail”), and her interiority is coherent, but conflict remains largely abstract. Micro‑choices exist—approach the water, follow the needle, decipher symbols—yet none extract a tangible price or reveal contradiction beyond trepidation. The “sensibly eccentric” trait doesn’t constrain action with visible cost. The culminating unity feels more bestowed than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s motive—to decode the slide and make art from it—is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction and on‑page micro‑choices under pressure are thin. Emotions are mostly labeled through abstractions (“timewoven alliances,” “turbine‑hum reverie”) rather than embodied conflict. The main action—cleaning the slide and sculpting—aligns with her traits, yet the choice carries little visible cost. The closing satisfaction reads earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    Luna’s motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks to understand night‑blooming flowers and pursues the cathedral as a method—but she faces little resistance and minimal contradictory impulse. Interiority is present yet generalized, with scant embodied conflict beyond a gentle shift from “vibrant” to “contemplative.” The change in her art reads as an earned reorientation but carries limited on‑page cost. Relationships and external pressures are absent, narrowing the crucible for character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.9)
    Naomi’s motive (uncover the diary’s truths) is clear and consistent, and the choice to reach out to Ada provides a small but real act of agency. However, interior contradiction is thin—her emotions are largely generalized (“felt a spark,” “felt an inexplicable connection”) rather than dramatized under pressure. Ada’s presence doesn’t actively corner Naomi into a costly choice; stakes remain mostly aspirational. The final resolve to keep pursuing truth reads more like continuation than an earned renunciation or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear—reimagine rather than restore—but interior conflict is thin and largely asserted. The alchemist’s feelings are abstract (“fierce intensity,” “determination”) with little embodied pressure or contradictory impulse. The decisive move (“time for contemplation was over”) arrives without a concrete cost. Actions align with aims but reveal little new about the character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clear motive (to archive emotional patterns) and a mild inner tension (wonder vs. trepidation) register, but micro-choices are limited to “continue working” and then “leave.” Interiority is generalized and often repeated (“The scribe…” stems), with little contradiction under pressure. The field‑trip memory adds color but not a consequential decision. Ending stance shifts to wary awe, yet without a felt cost that reveals deeper character contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear single-POV interiority with a stable desire, but the “furiously tranquil” trait remains mostly a label, and contradictory impulses rarely collide on the page. Her key act—blowing across the cap—arrives without a felt moral or relational trade-off, and later acceptance of duty reads serene rather than hard-won. Embodied emotion leans abstract (“overwhelming sense of purpose,” “wild serenity”) instead of showing specific, character-peculiar struggle. Motivation is consistent yet under-tested by concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Ember’s motive—favoring listening over alarm—consistently drives her shift from sirens to the bell, with a clear internal hinge at the “zero hour” hush. Interiority is present but largely summary-shaped; the hesitation over the bell rope is the strongest embodied beat. The renunciation of siren primacy reads as an earned stance even if the cost is softly held. Emotional contradiction is subtle rather than urgent, but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear motive (seeking strength in vulnerability) but interiority leans abstract and generic, with few embodied micro‑choices beyond sweeping and relocating the lantern glass. The janitor’s contradictions (reverence vs. labor; solitude vs. empathy) are stated rather than dramatized under pressure. Emotional progression is steady, not layered by real friction. The final stance feels declared more than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation to “preserve the weight of unspoken words” is clear and drives the choice to open and then close the box, but contradictory impulses are faint beyond generic sorrow and trembling. Interiority leans on repeated gaze/tears rather than distinct, character‑particular thinking. The visible cost lands as endurance (sleeplessness, heaviness) rather than a sharpened trade‑off. Still, the micro‑choices around the box read consistent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (to understand the “texture of time”), and a few micro-choices exist (embedding messages, repairing the capsule), but interiority stays generic and largely declarative. Contradictory impulses or embodied emotion are scarce; the timekeeper seldom struggles on the page. The “excitement was palpable” line tells rather than dramatizes. The final stance shift (renewed purpose) lacks a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear, consistent motive (seeking beauty in the incomplete) with embodied attention, but little contradictory impulse or pressure to force difficult choices. The poet mostly receives and reframes rather than struggles. Agency is primarily attentional; “tending the poem” doesn’t face friction. Emotional progression is gentle and credible but risk‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    The caretaker’s motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and their agency (choosing to remodel, persisting despite decline) aligns with those traits. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the piece rarely stages simultaneous competing impulses. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than embodied, limiting felt cost. The closing endurance reads earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation (to test an “artificial pilgrimage”) is clear, but interiority leans on labels (“academically rebellious,” “skeptic realized”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The entity arrives, yet the relationship pressure isn’t dramatized beyond a mutual gaze. Micro‑choices (following footprints, approaching the entrance) are present but carry little cost. The final “realization” feels told rather than earned via conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (restore a scarred place), and actions align (releasing horses, sowing/fertilizing). However, interiority is generalized and conflict‑light; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a pressured micro‑choice. The “speaks dead languages/understands birds” traits don’t complicate decisions. The ending reflects contentment without a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra’s goal (follow the riddle to the spring) is clear and consistent, and Kael’s sensory bias gives him presence, but interior conflict is thin. The dog’s past (retired from finding bodies) adds pathos yet doesn’t complicate on‑page choices. The key micro‑choice—Kael nudging the orb to spark Lyra’s insight—works but feels convenient rather than pressure‑driven. Emotional beats often resolve into tidy gratitude/peace without a felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s motive—transmuting confusion into exploration—is clear and consistent, and small choices (sketching, stepping forward) track to it. However, interiority leans generic (“sense of wonder,” “twinkling like diamonds”) and the “blessed pariah” label isn’t dramatized in behavior. Contradictory impulses are muted; trepidation registers but never truly complicates her action. The final move feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (restore the sky), but interior conflict is minimal and the chivalrous/sacredly playful traits rarely complicate choices. The protagonist meets no meaningful resistance; competence reads frictionless. Embodied emotion is light—more vista than visceral stress. The closing pride lands, yet the change entails no visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear roles and aims (actor-pragmatist, survivor-contemplative, historian-mission-driven) but interiority is thin and largely told. The actor’s alliance proposal is the only real micro-choice under pressure and carries little visible cost. Emotional texture leans abstract over embodied contradiction. Final repricing for the survivor (pawns as opportunities) is nice but lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (find the stone; understand “the shape of home”), and key choices—touching the stone and deciding to seed a new reality—align. Interiority is lyrical but generalized; contradictory impulses (sorrow vs. purpose) appear, yet remain lightly tested. Embodied emotion is present in touches and textures, though stakes remain abstract. The final stance feels more serene than earned by struggle, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and steady—atonement for a past coaching error—but the interior conflict rarely complicates action beyond resolve. The “fierce intensity” and sleep‑starved focus provide some embodiment, especially while unraveling the tapestry. However, the forgiveness arrives with minimal on‑page friction, reading tidy. Contradictory impulses (shame vs. hope) are asserted more than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clear motive (uncover truth before the ritual) and a visible tactic (impromptu poetry) give her agency, but interiority leans abstract over embodied conflict. Contradictory impulses (defiance vs. surrender to understanding) are stated rather than dramatized through concrete micro‑choices. The pivotal “single line” moment works, yet lacks a personalized cost (no specific history or interpersonal stake) to deepen character. Earned shift from defiance to understanding reads, but without granular emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear—she must decipher the statue before her breath gives out—and actions align with that drive. Stress is embodied (red‑rimmed eyes, blurring vision), though some interiority leans generic (“conjure meaning” repeats). Contradictory impulses (fear vs. compulsion) are present but not deeply dramatized. The final endurance choice reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clear desire and steady interiority, but pressure is low and contradictions are mostly labeled (“intimately aloof”) rather than dramatized. Micro-choices exist (shell, caves, painting), yet none carry visible cost. The cracked mirror offers motive but not an in‑scene test. Ending reads as satisfaction more than earned renunciation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian’s motive—to prove whispers outlast shouts—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choice to “beckon” channels that desire. However, internal contradiction is thin; he is serenely convinced rather than torn, so pressure on his values never forces a costly trade. Emotions are embodied via scent and sea-light but skew generalized (“vibrations of intent,” “screaming tenderness”) more than character-particular. The final stance shift reads as affirmation rather than a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (reclaiming the past, navigating grief) and consistent, with the moon-phase constraint adding character specificity. However, interiority leans on generic phrasing (“open wound,” “sense of purpose”) and the piece lacks pressured micro-choices. The final acceptance reads earned but low-cost, with little on-page contradiction or struggle enacted. The censer foot reactions hint at texture but don’t deepen conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation (to temper involuntary honesty and cultivate psychological safety) is clear and threads the piece, but it leans on abstract/therapy‑speak rather than embodied moments. The forager makes concrete micro‑choices (investigate eye, decode messages, unearth cache, choose to experiment). Internal contradiction (truth as blessing/curse) is present but told more than dramatized. The ending stance feels earned but low‑cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael’s motive—to decode the stranger’s gesture—reads clear, but he remains largely an observer with minimal contradictory impulses or pressured micro-choices. His “investigation” is mostly watchfulness rather than a choice that costs him. The final decision to take the boutonnière hints at a stance, but interiority stays surface-level and cautious. Stronger embodiment of stress or a compromised value would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (fulfilling her father’s promise), and Emilia makes a few choices (following ants, entering the cavern, choosing a path). However, interiority is generic and mostly summarized, with little embodied contradiction or cost. The “empirically intuitive” trait reads as a label rather than a dramatized, constraining habit of mind. The final emotional turn lands but feels low‑friction and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (unravel the dreams), and there’s a flicker of internal contradiction (trepidation vs pull), but interiority leans on generic phrasing (“she felt a sense of…”) rather than character‑particular texture. The companion exerts no pressure and thus the relationship crucible is unused. Key choices (climb; step into the grotto) carry little discernible cost on the page. The queen’s “softly commanding” quality appears once without shaping later behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clear motive (unlock the shell’s “density of presence”) and profession give her a frame, but she faces little friction and makes few pressured micro‑choices. Internal contradiction is thin; awe and method align too neatly. The overheard line sparks resolve but doesn’t force a trade‑off. The closing satisfaction arrives without a visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear motive (to record and shape dreams) and a modest internal shift (nostalgia from pain to catalyst), but the interiority leans abstract and labeled rather than embodied. Contradictory impulses (jealousy of past selves vs. present creation) are stated but not dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The final acceptance reads more told than earned by concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motive—continuing to “humanize” emotion after losing smell—is clear but mostly told rather than tested. Interiority is present yet abstract, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The physical interaction with the birthing clamp screw hints at embodied response, but no real micro‑choices under stress emerge. The closing “decision” to keep reading between the lines feels pre‑decided and low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaito’s motive—turning scars into stories through rune‑guided writing—is clear, and the quill/object reactions align. However, internal contradiction and on‑page struggle are light; his urge to “shed” doesn’t meet a counter‑impulse beyond ambient tremors. The change (writing to completion; relief) lands but with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s motive (to apologize to Astra) is clear and consistent, with embodied touches (her handling of the bottle, the archive’s tactility). Internal contradiction is light: we feel guilt and urgency but not a vivid push‑pull under pressure. Her action—sending the apology via music—aligns with her identity, though the “gossip-column” facet doesn’t actively complicate choices. The change at the end (relief/hope) is credible but carries a soft, mostly conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is explicit (unify truths, resolve illusions) but interiority remains abstract, with few concrete, pressured micro-choices. The “walking outward/going inward” motif signals intention more than conflict. No contradictory impulses on the page; the epiphany reads granted rather than struggled for. The final endurance/renunciation cost isn’t legible.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation (to understand what clocks measure) is clear and consistent, and small actions (turning the key, counting backward, vigilant monitoring) align with it. Internal conflict is faint—“fascinated and intimidated”—but never forces a hard trade‑off or mistake. Interiority stays generalized rather than character‑particular beyond the occupation conceit. The renewed purpose at dawn reads as endurance more than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lena’s desire to “understand the physics of letting go” is clear and consistent, but she faces little pressure that exposes contradiction or forces a costly choice. Interiority is present yet often abstracted into thesis statements rather than embodied struggle. Her competence (spatially gifted) never meets meaningful resistance. The closing stance shift feels low-cost and largely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular (probability scholar trying to help her gambler father), and her interiority has some specificity via the lantern and subway habits. However, the conflict remains largely contemplated rather than dramatized, so contradictory impulses don’t actively collide on the page. The final resolve to design a program reads credible but low-cost. More embodied struggle or a present-tense test with the father would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.6)
    The operator’s motive (curating connection from wrong numbers) is clear, but we don’t see pressured micro‑choices or contradictory impulses on the page. Interiority is generalized rather than character‑particular and embodied. The endurance at dawn reads as intention affirmed, not a change with visible cost. Absence of on‑page relational friction limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clear motive (preserve small moments) and a steady temperament are established, but there’s scant internal contradiction or pressure testing her values. Actions—observing, documenting, pocketing the photo—never force a trade-off. Emotions trend summarized rather than embodied beyond a generalized “haunted euphoria.” The persona feels credible yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    Raven’s motive (curing loneliness) is clear and drives their tactic (rumor‑seeding), and the brief crack in the “desperately jocular” mask adds nuance. However, emotion is mostly told rather than embodied, with few concrete micro‑choices under pressure. The shift from pain to peace reads earned but low‑cost. Secondary pressure via other characters is summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (seek the stillpoint to reckon with sorrow), but interior conflict is largely told rather than dramatized via micro‑choices. The mapmaker meets little resistance; competence and serenity dominate. Trepidation is named, yet no concrete trade‑off or contradictory impulse is tested on the page. The emotional pivot at the end reads more as serene acceptance than costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motive to restore the pen and “thresh meaning from experience” is clear, but interiority leans abstract and rarely shows embodied contradiction under pressure. The “wrong seeds” regret hints at complexity, yet it doesn’t create on‑page friction against her present tactic. Micro‑choices (unbend, dip, write) align with motive but feel low‑stakes. The role shift to “guardian” is asserted more than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    The advisor’s motive—translating silence into music—is clear and consistent, and their attention to the old man’s signing provides a credible throughline. However, interiority is mostly summarized; we seldom feel contradictory impulses or embodied stress. Micro‑choices (beyond “watch, interpret, conduct”) are thin. The final endurance/renunciation cost is conceptual rather than felt, limiting character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s motive (keeping a forgotten promise and uncovering the vandalism’s truth) is clear and consistent, and the arsonist/preservationist contradiction hints at complexity. However, interior conflict remains mostly declared rather than dramatized under pressure. Micro-choices exist (choosing to leave a trail of art), but costs are soft and largely abstract. The closing endurance reads more as affirmation than a felt renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s motive—to nurture a shared dream and ease the tangle of memories—is clear and consistent, and her drumming reads as a character‑specific tactic. However, internal contradiction is mild; “quietly rebellious” is asserted more than dramatized with cost. Embodied emotion appears (“feet tapping,” “pang of auroral sorrow”) but often drifts into abstraction. The final endurance choice (to continue drumming despite ephemerality) lands, though the cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear motive (prove whispers travel farther) and competence are established, but internal contradiction and cost are thin. She makes few pressured micro‑choices beyond steady exploration and approaching the stranger. Emotions are lightly embodied; excitement is told rather than dramatically conflicted. The ending stance shift feels mild rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    Both figures are ciphers; interiority is absent and motivation is asserted rather than dramatized (“to teach darkness the value of stars”). The guardian’s only discernible choice is a late, gentle mirroring gesture, more motif than decision under pressure. Emotional states are named (“spiralingly calm,” “silent empathy”) rather than embodied with contradiction. The relationship registers as aura, not a crucible forcing a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s motive is clear and consistent, but he rarely faces contradictory impulses or a concrete test of resolve. Almost every move is declarative or visionary rather than pressured, so interior conflict reads thin. The “weight of his task” is named but not dramatized through tough micro‑choices. The final stance shift feels earned conceptually, not emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s yearning and impulsive plunge are clear and character‑true, but the internal struggle resolves too smoothly. Interiority leans on abstractions (“true nature,” “freedom”) rather than scene‑bound contradictions. The unlocking moment lands, yet the felt cost of shedding a former self is gestured at more than embodied. Still, her micro‑choices (leaving the dock; returning changed) map coherently to motive.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    Echo’s motive—cultivating lightness within grief—is tangible, and choices like retrieving and installing the bouquet reveal character. However, pressure is low and few on‑page micro‑choices carry cost; interior contradiction is stated more than dramatized. The “moral ambiguity” claim lacks a concrete, consequential act to test it. Emotional texture is present but seldom embodied under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (seeking artistic breakthrough post‑ban), and moments like her toes curling over the ice embody feeling. However, interior conflict is thin; she meets little friction beyond awe. “Surrender to the muse” arrives without a competing impulse on the page, so the change costs little. The result feels like a single‑note yearning fulfilled rather than a charged choice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motives are clearly stated (finding beauty in imperfection) but rarely tested; the painter faces little opposition and few consequential micro-choices. “Innocently cunning” is told rather than dramatized. Interiority is thin, with epiphanies declared rather than earned in scene. Relationship pressure with the glassblower is minimal and risk-free.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clear curiosity and tenderness inform the bell ringer’s actions, but interior conflict is minimal and choices are low-pressure. Repeated abstractions (“texture of connection”) replace embodied struggle. The lens-cleaning is a nice particular but doesn’t force a tradeoff. The protagonist ends satisfied without a visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (“teach withering to bloom again”) and the maker’s tactics (origami coordinates, focused craft) align, but interiority stays generalized and largely told. Contradictory impulses under pressure are absent; grief and hope don’t collide on the page so much as alternate in summary. Embodied emotion appears (sandalwood, myrrh, deft fingers), yet the peak insight is asserted rather than earned in a fraught choice. The change feels gentle and credible but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to decode patterns post‑crash) but little on‑page contradiction or cost under pressure. Interiority is persuasive yet generalized; she measures, reflects, and decides to continue with minimal friction. The most specific embodied beat—the tape coiled in her pocket—doesn’t force a choice. The final stance (quiet satisfaction, onward) reads earned but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (forbidden knowledge), and she makes a few choices (accepting and using the pagoda), but internal contradiction is thin and largely summarized as “anguished joy.” The colleague adds no real interpersonal pressure, so decisions aren’t contested. The transformation is stated rather than earned through on‑page struggle. Emotional embodiment leans on abstractions more than concrete, character‑specific reaction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (preserve hope, study the collective unconscious), and a few micro-choices occur (follow the thread; decide to share findings). However, internal conflict is muted; contradictory impulses rarely act simultaneously. Emotions trend abstract rather than embodied under pressure. The final stance feels earned but low-cost and largely declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motivation and interiority focus Lena’s reevaluation, and tactile beats (handling the chameleon’s tail, reconstructing enclosures) reveal character. However, contradictory impulses rarely collide in-scene; doubt yields smoothly to resolve without a felt price. The “con” remains abstract, so her change reads low-cost. The final stance is credible but under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s motive is clear and consistent—“a closure seeker with a penchant for opening wounds”—but interior contradiction and on‑page cost remain faint. We glimpse embodied stress (anesthesia wearing off, ragged breathing), yet decisions are largely predetermined rather than pressured into shape. The final sense of closure feels more declared than earned by a trade‑off. Still, the plant‑whisper and coffee‑ring habits add some character‑specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (uncover where unused love is stored), and the choice to perform psychometry follows. However, interior conflict is minimal; the crystal gazer meets little resistance and makes few pressured micro‑choices. Emotions are largely summarized in lyrical terms rather than embodied contradictions. The final acceptance/renunciation cost is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear desire (freeing “trapped creativity”) and a steady ritual give motive, but internal conflict is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Choices (adjusting the astrolabe, tracing stars, resting) face little counter‑pressure. The epiphany at dawn feels earned texturally, yet the cost of change is faint. Embodied contradiction or a harder trade‑off would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    Asa’s motive (guard the archive, nurture “sparks”) is clear and consistent, and key micro‑choices (reactivating the clock, focusing through wave functions) align with it. However, interior contradiction is light; she rarely struggles or pays a felt emotional price beyond brief disorientation. The “dreamless” trait is evocative but under‑dramatized as a limiter. The closing resolve reads earned but low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation (to understand his translocation and mind) is clear, but internal contradiction is minimal and risk-averse. He largely drifts rather than chooses under pressure; the key “choice” is to close his eyes and listen. Embodied emotion is mostly wonder and calm, so we don’t see strain or misbelief challenged. The final “changed perspective” feels earned texturally, not through a pressured, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eira is a steady presence with one clear trait, but interiority and contradictory impulses are thin, and the travelers are faceless. Motivation (“unused courage”) is stated rather than dramatized under pressure. The star-stamping is a nice behavioral beat, yet no choice with visible cost is forced on the page. The ending stance feels earned in mood, not in character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.6)
    The interior conflict—duty-bound silence vs. yearning for voice—is clear and consistent, with a credible endurance choice by the end. However, micro-choices are sparse and mostly observational; the figure’s appearance doesn’t force the bellhop into a pressed decision. Emotions skew summarized (“a sense of peace,” “unpardnable silence”) rather than embodied. The final acceptance reads earned but low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael’s motive and method are clear and consistent, but interiority remains thin and largely summarized. We see patience and confidence but little contradictory impulse under pressure. The confrontation is reported rather than dramatized, muting embodied emotion. Actions align with motives, yet the final choice carries minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.6)
    Maya’s motivation (to understand disappearing paths) is clear and consistent, and her small actions (poring over logs, assembling a drum and map) align. Interiority leans abstract and mantra-like, with limited embodied contradiction under pressure. The closing acceptance—listening to rhythms over maps—reads as a soft renunciation with minimal felt cost. Character specificity is present but cushioned by generalized eco-lyric diction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear (recover purpose amid a lull) and actions align, but interior contradiction is muted; she rarely wavers beyond generalized insignificance. Embodiment is decent (bare feet on cold metal, vibration through cells). The final resolve feels earned by the journey and hum, though the on‑page cost is soft. “Awkwardly confident” appears more as label than pressure that complicates choices.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Akira’s motive (find and unseal the embryo) is clear and sustained, and the plant‑telepathy gives her a particular interior filter. However, her “insurgent grandmother” identity doesn’t shape tactics or contradictions, and internal conflict is minimal—she wants something and gets it without credible resistance. Emotional embodiment leans on generic intensifiers (“surge,” “shiver,” “whispers to a fevered pitch”) rather than character‑specific contradictions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear—she comes to reconcile trauma and find calm—but internal contradiction is underplayed, and the path to peace feels relatively unresisted. Embodied detail (wind, shoulders easing, breath slowing) helps, yet moments verge on label-speak (“somatic markers,” “anchor optimism in realism”). The final resolve to “carry the pearl of stillness” lands but with limited visible cost. More friction between grief and the calming environment would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    A single, specific interior lens emerges: a crestfallen portraitist seeking meaning and control via the tactile work of untangling the broken box. Interiority is consistent and embodied through hands-on action, though rhetorical questions sometimes replace dramatized contradiction. The shift from despair to purposeful acceptance feels earned, but the cost remains largely conceptual. No relational crucible limits the range of pressures on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s motive (find the missing person to probe time’s slowing) is clear and mostly consistent, with a few concrete micro-choices (kneeling to study the smudge, following the patterns, gentle approach and touch). “Serene anger” is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The internal change (“knew that they had finally found what they were searching for”) lands without a visible cost. Character texture (eyes, hair, drone reliance) adds specificity but not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motive—to provoke a suppressed conversation—is clear and drives her choices, but her “bravely conflicted” state is mostly asserted rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses under pressure. The decision to thaw, read, and disseminate unfolds with minimal internal friction or visible cost. Interiority leans abstract (“contraband truths,” “status quo”) over embodied emotion. The closing self‑relabeling as “guardian of contraband truths” lands, but feels earned more by declaration than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    Aria’s pacifist resolve is clear, but internal contradiction is minimal; she has already chosen, so we never watch her struggle under pressure. The sword functions as a symbol of renunciation, yet no on‑page micro‑choice tests that stance. Interiority is calm and consistent but leans on summary rather than embodied, pressured moments. The healer/rebuilder identity is persuasive, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear (seek the goddess’s echo) and actions align (zigzagging, “voicing silence”), but interior contradiction is faint and the fisher faces little psychological friction or cost. Embodied emotion is limited to generic awe and reverence; “cool‑headed” remains a label rather than a pressure‑tested trait. The rail spike and “transliterating emotions” hint at specificity but don’t provoke micro‑choices under stress. The ending registers fulfillment more than a charged renunciation or costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear (protect the family legacy by uncovering truth), but contradictory impulses remain mostly stated rather than dramatized in action. Apart from picking up the pen and deciding on a strategy, micro‑choices under pressure are thin. The heirloom’s supposed power isn’t tested, so we don’t see her flaws or blind spots cost her anything. The final resolve reads credible but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clear motivation (to quiet old guilt) and a concrete choice (tethering) anchor the POV, but interior conflict often arrives as told summary rather than embodied contradiction. The baby-cry translation trait doesn’t pressure on-page choices, reading as thematic garnish. Emotional progression is coherent yet tidy: guilt lifts quickly once the “haunted firmware” is named as projection. Strong occupational texture, but few micro-choices under strain beyond the tether.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear inner drive (“to discover meaning in the mess”) and a consistent practice (mandala‑making) give her agency, with small but present micro‑choices (two “interject” moments). Interiority is mostly credible if abstract, leaning on repeated phrases (“inner world,” “unlearning”) rather than idiosyncratic embodiment. The contradictory pull—comfort versus warning in the “emergent hush”—is felt, though not deeply conflictual. The final stance (peace with lingering unease) reads earned, if soft.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    Aria’s motive—to “cradle empathy in arms of steel” and reclaim the plaza—reads clear, but her interiority leans declarative over dramatized conflict. The retrocognitive memory adds texture yet doesn’t force a contradictory impulse or a costly compromise. Micro‑choices (excavating the tessera, choosing to rename) reveal character but face little active resistance. The “gentle radical” identity is stated more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Echo’s desire for an encore and peace is clear, and her actions (touching the coin, weaving echoes) align with that motive. However, interiority remains abstract and summarized, with few concrete micro‑choices under pressure. Emotional contradiction (longing vs. letting go) is implied but not dramatized in a specific beat. The ending’s acceptance reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Luna’s drive—to replace recalled telepathy pills with a somatic/geode method—reads consistent and particular, with a credible pull between fascination and intimidation. Embodied cues (tingling skin, scents, dancing with light sources) root her interiority. However, conflict is gentle and largely unopposed, yielding few pressured micro‑choices. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motive (to “become the voice of the unknown”) is clear and consistent, and the tactile focus on her craft gives some interior specificity. However, she faces little counter‑pressure or contradiction; emotions largely affirm the same drive without friction. The fossil “guiding” her is gestural rather than a crucible, so no values trade‑off lands. The ending serenity arrives without a felt cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (preserve the past, “spin a prophecy into raw possibility”) and consistent, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion are minimal. The turner’s choices—lifting the jar, cataloging buttons—rarely register as pressured micro‑decisions. We don’t feel competing impulses or visible cost beyond patience and persistence. The closing “returned to work, quietly inspired” reads as endurance, but the price of that stance isn’t dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear motive (to mend what’s broken) and a credible contradictory impulse (trepidation vs. “prudently daring”) drive her micro‑choices to search, follow, and face the figure. Embodied detail (burned skin’s weight, cold air) lands, but much emotion is abstracted into generalized phrasing. The self‑encounter reads as internal but is not deeply particularized in psychology beyond stated courage. Change is earned if quiet, yet the cost is lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single‑POV interiority is present and sensorial, but it leans abstract (“palimpsest promise,” “distill complexity”) over contradictory impulses under pressure. The coachman’s patience and attentiveness read consistent, yet almost no micro‑choices create visible cost. His nodding and urging the horses are gentle rather than revealing value hierarchy. The meeting with the traveler doesn’t force a conflicted decision.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    Akira’s motive—seeking why places resist change—is clear and consistent, but pressure never forces a contradictory impulse to surface. Her micro‑choices (thrum, follow the sun patterns, take the glass, depart) are gentle and low‑cost. Interiority is particular enough to her craft and temperament, yet the epiphany arrives with little friction. The result is steady, serene characterization without a real crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gardener’s motive—tending and “reflecting light”—is consistent and embodied in pruning the rosebush, accepting cycles with a gentle cost. Interiority is steady but low‑friction; contradictory impulses are faint (nostalgia versus pragmatism). The lockmaster token hints at depth but doesn’t drive a pressured choice. The final stance feels earned but modest in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra’s interiority is gentle but generalized; she polishes, watches light, and reflects, yet few micro‑choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation (translate isolation into independence) is stated rather than dramatized through costly decisions. The closing acceptance reads plausible but lightly earned, with minimal contradiction or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lena’s motive—seeking connection—tracks cleanly and her micro-choices (plucking the twig, deciding to weave it into the installation) align, but interior conflict stays abstract (“thread that connected all things”) and low-pressure. The “love letter ghostwriter/keeper of secrets” adds color yet doesn’t complicate a choice on the page. Emotions are mostly labeled rather than embodied under stress. The closing shift feels earned but lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.6)
    Lyra’s goal is clear and consistent, but she faces little credible resistance and shows almost no contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority leans on labels (“cautiously hopeful,” “sense of purpose”) rather than embodied, character‑specific struggle. Her decisive act (sending a counter‑signal) comes without visible cost or moral friction. The colleagues register as scenery rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motivation (seek the “vital key”) and a defined flaw (claustrophobia) anchor Lyra, with tactile actions (lantern, lock‑picking) revealing competence. Internal contradiction—fear versus compulsion—exists but softens too quickly once the crystal awakens, limiting felt struggle. The epiphany (the key is insight) lands but risks neatness. Emotional embodiment is present yet leans on generalized awe rather than idiosyncratic contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear desires (her numbness; his need to reframe cold cases) but largely told, not dramatized, and contradictions are asserted rather than embodied. The strongest beat is her “lance the boil” impulse, yet it arrives as abstraction with little on‑page cost. The relationship dynamic is gentle but static; no status shift beyond shared understanding. Actions (painting, pocketing the ribbon) don’t materially test their motives.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Emilia’s motive (honor an ancestor) and trait (“nervously confident”) are clear, but we don’t see distinct micro‑choices under pressure beyond “continue researching.” Interiority is largely summarized and iterative rather than dramatized. No earned change or credible renunciation lands on the page by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    The fiddler’s motive (unburdening secrets, seeking redemption) is clear, but interior conflict rarely manifests as on‑page, pressured micro‑choices. The “pixelated amnesty” nudge and the scaffold‑wrap message trigger reflection more than decision. The choice to play and to “recount” is asserted rather than contested. Emotional texture remains generalized, with little embodied contradiction at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single‑POV interiority is clear and consistent, but conflict remains largely reflective and low-pressure. The key “choice” is a late resolve to share his story, which carries minimal on‑page cost. Traits (perceptively calm, robber’s son) inform noticing and worldview yet rarely force a trade‑off. Emotional contradiction is muted; the arc feels tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lyra’s drive (decoding inscriptions; healing with words) is clear, but interior conflict is minimal and the “renewed determination” arrives without much friction. Emotions skew summarized (“she felt a sense of midnight solace”) rather than embodied under pressure. Micro-choices are mostly procedural (keep working) rather than value-testing. The final shift reads more like affirmation than a costly, character-defining turn.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (seeking what mirrors don’t show) and the touch on the ice is a concrete micro‑choice, but interior conflict is thin and often stated rather than embodied. The “guarded druid” reads competent and calm with little friction between impulses. The reunion with a figure from the past hints at layered psychology, but it isn’t dramatized beyond summary. The closing realization lands, though without a palpable, personal cost that would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s motive (purposeful curiosity) is clear and drives her entry, but she faces little genuine friction or contradictory impulse in scene. Interiority is sensorially grounded, yet the lack of a visible cost or a tested value hierarchy flattens the arc. The “root‑bound visionary” label is stated rather than revealed through pressured micro‑choices. The final stance (“journey beginning”) reads earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation (to mend herself) is clear and consistent, and the Eight of Swords moment gives a solid, character‑specific anchor. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she moves fairly smoothly from urge to action to peace without visible friction. “Reckless” never tests itself against an on‑page danger or price. Micro‑choices exist (picking up and smoothing the card; choosing to weave), but the emotional cost remains generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    Jack’s interiority is clear—restless, ashamed, craving the rush—but leans on generalized phrasing (“confidently uncertain,” “echo valley longing”) rather than action under pressure. The phone call activates his professional reflex and shows a credible split between fact‑armor and yearning. The final resolve to “make notes” signals change but lands with low visible cost. Stronger embodiment of contradictory impulses in scene would sharpen him.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motive (bridge living and departed via analogical thinking) is clear, but internal contradiction and embodied stakes are thin. She “sets to work” without a tangible obstacle or misgiving to complicate her methodical nature. Emotional texture leans on labels more than concrete micro‑choices. The final “success” reads asserted rather than earned by conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.7)
    The titan‑gear librarian has a clear desire and distinctive sensibility, but rarely faces on‑page pressure that compels choice. Interiority is evocative yet generalized, with minimal contradictory impulses enacted in scene. Most actions are ritual description rather than micro‑choices with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s motivation (to “crown” the pearl and dissolve her heart’s walls) is clear but largely abstract and unpressured. Interiority leans on generalized phrasing (“walls around her heart,” “abandoned hopes”) rather than character‑particular embodiment. The final shift—leaving with the pearl’s radiance—reads as a credible soft change but with minimal felt cost. Her job (bunker inspector) never tests or complicates her decisions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (self-forgiveness) is clear and consistent, with tactile habits (map, accordion) that sketch character. However, her on-page choices are low-stress—sit, play, fold, walk—so contradictory impulses never truly collide. The stopped-medication detail hints at risk but isn’t dramatized into a live dilemma. The final “acceptance” reads more observed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and steady (to find the library of unspoken words), and actions align (opening the tome, measuring whispers, stepping through the doorway). However, interior conflict is light; contradictory impulses rarely co‑act on the page. Emotional texture leans generalized (reverence, anticipation) over embodied specificity. The closing realization feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elian’s motive (unravel the violin’s past to “propagate” perforated destiny) is clear, and her contradiction (dream vs empire) provides a live tension. The coffee reading and the final decision to act show micro‑choices aligned with her aims. However, the interiority leans abstract (“determined… no matter the cost”) rather than embodied, blunting specificity. The visible cost remains largely conceptual rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aria’s longing to cross into “stillness” versus her compulsion to finish the emerald creates a credible, contradictory drive. Her micro‑choices (attuning, resisting, focusing) align with motive and craft. Emotional embodiment skews abstract at times, softening the pressure. The final renunciation feels earned, if gently priced.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.7)
    Aria’s motives are clear (caretaking and the quest for contentment), but her “kindly decisive nature” rarely confronts a cost on the page. Micro‑choices exist (climb, descend, resume tasks) yet none are pressured. Interiority leans generic and reflective rather than character‑particular under stress. The late “I must continue to explore the hairpin” reads tidy, not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conscience’s motive is clear, but interior conflict is mostly told, not dramatized; we rarely see contradictory impulses acted through in scene. The brief self‑glimpse in the mirror shard hints at cost and vulnerability but arrives late and lightly. The client remains off‑stage, so pressure on the focalizer’s choices is minimal. Actions align with stated aims, yet the emotional journey feels pre‑decided rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motives are explicit (teach “vanishing to appear”) but interiority is generic and unpressured. The “backwards aging” trait never influences choices. Few micro‑choices occur beyond quiet instruction, and no contradiction or cost colors the epiphany. The relationship dynamic remains static admiration rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The skimmer’s motive—learning to “navigate without moving”—is clear and consistent, and its endurance reads as an earned stance. Interiority is present but abstract, with few micro‑choices beyond attention and appraisal. The centuries of waiting register as a cost and align with its temperament. However, embodied contradiction and pressure‑specific reactions remain muted by the meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear (fear of creative withering; desire to find “the sacred in the simple”), and her micro‑choices—touching and unstrapping the keystone—align. However, interiority leans generalized and declarative; contradictory impulses rarely act simultaneously on the page. Emotional cost is muted, with competence in “mist walking” softening struggle. The epiphany lands but feels largely told rather than earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s desire is clear and consistent, but interiority leans generic (“overwhelming sense of purpose,” “truth hiding behind the words”) with few character‑particular contradictions. He makes small choices—opening the book, pressing on, following the glow—but we don’t see a live internal trade‑off under pressure. The line “he knew he had to signify his commitment” gestures at change without dramatizing what it costs him. As a result, the final shift reads more as epiphany than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clear singular motive and method, but the interiority remains generalized and low-conflict. “Quietly enthusiastic” and “stellar doubt” sketch a mood rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. The choice to drink the droplet is motivated yet costless on the page. Lacks micro‑choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear (to name fears, to understand sacrifice), and actions align (raising hands, crystallizing echoes, then letting go). Interiority is consistent but leans on summary (“heart remained heavy,” “sense of peace”) rather than embodied contradiction. The grief/duty tension is present but rarely forces a concrete, pressured choice on the page. Final endurance reads as Earned Stasis with a modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear motive and single‑POV focus, but interior contradiction is mostly asserted (“lukewarm,” “earnestly naive”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The mage acts competently with little visible struggle or trade‑off. Micro‑choices (the dropper, the pacing) reveal care but not conflict. The closing pride and purpose feel unopposed by any cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear (use photographs to help the community heal), but interior contradiction and embodied cost are thin. The warden largely observes and asserts purpose rather than facing a pressured choice that reveals competing values. Specific perceptions (“child’s forgotten toy,” “street sign creaking”) hint at character but don’t force a trade‑off. The result is credible but emotionally under‑pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motive (harmonizing logic and intuition) is clear and consistent, and her choice to craft a burner and test the crystal aligns with it. Interiority stays generalized; we get sentiment and wonder but little contradictory impulse under pressure. The “secretly sentimental” note doesn’t generate on‑page cost or a choice that complicates tactics. Overall, she reads capable and reverent but rarely stressed or divided.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motives are clear (preserve trust, map the skies) and consistent, but pressure rarely forces contradictory impulses into a live choice. Lyra is highly competent with little visible struggle beyond fatigue, so interior conflict reads summarized rather than dramatized. The parachute buckle and “watcher’s burden” hint at cost but don’t compel a hard decision. The ending registers endurance more than an earned trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear (defeat numbness, reclaim self) and consistent, but interiority leans on abstract labels (“emotional numbness,” “ego death”) over embodied contradiction. Few micro-choices appear beyond meditating and reframing the jar; the shift to peace feels asserted more than pressured. The “slices through pretense” moment names an attribute without dramatizing its cost. Still, the arc from fixation on the duplicate brain to acceptance provides a credible, if gentle, reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.1)
    Her desire to protect and invigorate her business is clear, but interiority leans abstract (“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal approaches”) and lacks character‑specific contradiction. The main action—deciding to design a new room—reads credible but low‑pressure. Embodied feeling is modest (pacing, handling the seed), with little friction beyond sleeplessness. The arc ends with renewed purpose but without a visible moral or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elwes’s goal is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction and micro-choices are thin; he mostly performs, with little dramatized hesitation or competing impulse. Embodied emotion appears (“mournfully eager,” exhaustion), yet reads label-forward at times. His endurance pays off in a credible shift (laughter returns), but the price is modestly felt. No relational crucible on the page limits complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear motive (guard the library; “make friends with uncertainty”) and a coherent inner state, but conflict is mostly abstract. Micro-choices exist (closing her eyes, inviting the mist in) yet lack sharp counter-impulse or visible risk. “Dimensional homesickness” reads label-first rather than dramatized constraint. The ending shift to peace is plausible but pays a light cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear—shatter fate via creative destruction—and actions track (gathering, channeling, reassembly). However, interiority leans abstract and declarative, with few embodied contradictions under pressure. “Stoically sensitive” registers as a label more than a live constraint. The closing shift (from bound to self‑authored) lands but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motive (to uncover a hidden truth) is clear, but her interiority leans abstract and buffered by certainty, with little contradiction or cost. Micro‑choices (clearing her mind, following resonance) are present yet frictionless. The realization arrives without resistance or sacrifice, so the change reads more as affirmation than earned shift. The “serenely electric” affect stays constant, reducing dynamic emotional range.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s drive (to uncover the vanishing ferry and “merge parallel timelines”) is clear and consistent, and she makes a culminating choice to step into the unknown. However, interiority leans generic and declarative, with few contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional embodiment skews toward stock phrasing (“mix of excitement and trepidation”) rather than character‑particular texture. The cost of her final choice remains lightly felt rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.0)
    The architect’s desire to reconcile logic and wonder is clear, but her interiority leans abstract and repetitive rather than character‑particular. We get few embodied contradictions beyond “unsettling calm” at the precipice. Micro‑choices (following and weaving the thread) exist but carry little visible cost. The persona “fever dream architect” remains more concept than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear (to teach and expand understanding), but she faces no real pressure, contradiction, or cost on the page. Interiority leans generic (“sense of wonder,” “pride”) with little embodied conflict or micro‑choices. Secondary characters (students) don’t actively pressure her. The ending offers affirmation without an earned personal inflection or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s motive—reconnecting “lost hearts”—is clear and consistently enacted, and her caution approaching the grieving woman reads true. However, interior conflict is thin; she meets little resistance and pays little on‑page cost beyond carrying the work’s weight. Emotional texture leans on generalized phrases (“a balm to her sorrow”) rather than contradictory impulses. The sister registers as a function more than a pressure on Aria’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear (retrieve the codex, honor the unremembered), but interiority stays summarized and largely unconflicted. The “claustrophobic spelunker” tension is named without acting on the page to complicate choices. Her competence erases struggle; she meets no true resistance beyond the tide. The closing peace reads tidy rather than earned from a difficult internal trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Akira’s desire to understand the digital ghost is clear and consistent, and her renunciation at dawn registers as a modest change. However, interiority leans abstract, with limited contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Much of the emotion is told rather than dramatized through pressured micro‑choices. The final relinquishment of the shard suggests cost but lands softly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single‑POV interiority is present but largely abstract; the storyteller’s motives (preserve the dying language by translating texture into sound) are clear yet low on embodied conflict. Micro‑choices (“began to harness their power”) read as procedural rather than pressured. The “quietly articulate” trait remains label‑level with little contradictory impulse on the page. The final stance shift feels more asserted than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lena’s motive and coping strategy are clear, and her micro‑choice to pick up the phone credibly exposes her to risk. Interiority is present but often told rather than dramatized (“turning bitterness into a cosmic joke” is asserted repeatedly). We get trepidation and grim resolve, but simultaneous contradictory impulses rarely collide in scene. The change at the end reads as earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.1)
    Luna’s motive—to reawaken beauty—is clear and consistent, but interior conflict is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized.

The final renunciation (leaving to continue the work) carries little felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (driven to “find where broken promises heal”) and consistent with his risk-taking, but interiority is largely told rather than embodied. Micro-choices exist (waiting for the drone’s diversion, timing the crossing) yet conflict between impulses is minimal. The recipient offers no on-page relational pressure. The final sense of satisfaction feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear—“to interpret silence as possibility” propels the carpenter to follow the song and then return to work with a changed stance. Interiority is gentle and consistent but leans abstract, with limited contradictory impulses or visible cost. The singer functions more as catalyst than pressure, so relational crucible is minimal. The closing endurance/renunciation (returning to work) is credible but light on felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear—she tends the library’s “analog memories” and seeks to reawaken stories—but interiority remains generalized and largely declarative. There’s little on‑page conflict or contradictory impulse; she simply persists. Micro‑choices (“pencil moved with increasing urgency”) exist but lack consequence. The result is a steady portrait rather than a pressured character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear—deciphering a “cipher of longing” through dawn work—but internal contradiction and embodied pressure are minimal. Elian’s choices (rise, shoot, paint, review) seldom evolve under stress, yielding steadiness rather than earned change. Emotions are largely abstract (“luminous absence”) rather than particularized bodily texture. The endurance ending reads as credible but low-cost Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (freeing a trapped idea), but interiority stays generalized and rarely becomes character‑particular. We get competence and calm persistence, yet no contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotions are labeled (“improbable longing”) more than embodied. The final sense of release reads earned but low‑cost, offering limited character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.6)
    Emilia’s motives (curiosity, memory-recovery) are clear and consistent, and small choices (wading, coaxing the mushroom, resolving to “follow the thread”) align with them. Interiority leans abstract at times, with limited contradictory impulses on the page beyond a light trepidation versus determination. Embodied emotion surfaces (“damp earth and decaying fruit,” knee‑deep water) but peak beats rely on generalized statements. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost, more vow than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s motives (protective, mentoring, meticulous) are clear and embodied through task-driven choices and tactile focus on tea leaves and glass. Contradictory impulses—nervous backward-walking vs. surgical precision, fierce gentleness—register on the page. However, “to mentor resilience quietly” is told rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost. The final stance shift (quiet triumph; habit easing) is credible but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.9)
    Aria’s goal is clear (restore balance/preserve wonder), but she faces no meaningful resistance or contradictory impulse on the page. Interiority leans into reverence rather than pressure, so decisions read as inevitable, not contested. The planting and spell‑weaving show competence without struggle, blunting character revelation. Final peace arrives without an earned cost that would reconfigure her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear—she repairs the net to ground spirits—and the labor reads as a chosen discipline under pressure. Interiority is mostly declared rather than conflicted; “lucid unrest” hints at ambiguity but rarely manifests as competing impulses in action. Micro-choices (teasing knots, pacing breath) align with goal yet lack a sharp moment of value trade‑off. The final felt cost is modest: she carries the hush with her rather than confronting a harder renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear, but interior contradiction and embodied cost are thin; she shivers, focuses, and feels reverence without confronting a real dilemma. Her “shielded openness” is named more than dramatized. Micro‑choices (e.g., how she risks belief versus skepticism) remain summarized rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s motive (“the physics of letting go”) is clear and consistently enacted through tactile micro‑choices (shaking the globe, untangling the net, transcribing). Interiority is particular and embodied (salt, decay, red‑rimmed eyes), though insights occasionally verge on thesis. Internal contradiction (seeking answers vs. accepting reframing) is present but soft. The final acceptance carries a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The balladeer’s motive (to articulate unspoken needs by contacting the ghost in code) is clear and consistent, with tactile choices (picking up the plate, deciding to encode on the bench). However, interiority leans generalized and declarative (“to articulate unspoken needs”) rather than character‑particular under stress. There’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost to complicate her drive. The final self‑recognition lands but feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motivation (to decode the diary and find “joy beneath the anguish”) is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction and on‑page cost are minimal. Her choices—reading, walking, opening a door—rarely force trade‑offs or reveal deeper flaws. Interiority trends abstract (“quiet understanding,” “sense of peace”) rather than character‑particular embodiment. The closing acceptance reads earned but low stakes at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra’s vocation and reverent drive to “memorialize” are clear, but she faces little counter‑pressure or contradictory impulse on the page. Her agency skews toward attention and note‑taking rather than a pressured choice with cost. The mentor legacy and telescope add texture without forcing a dilemma. The final serenity feels earned emotionally but lightly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.6)
    The artist’s desire to “mirror the sky inside walls” and to finish before demolition reads cleanly, with small, credible micro‑choices (opening the safe, reading the coin, returning to the canvas). Interiority is atmospheric rather than psychologically particular, so contradictions (compulsion vs. futility) are gestured at more than dramatized. The “face blind” trait never meaningfully pressures action. The exit with the safe and coin registers a quiet cost but not a hard-earned personal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s curiosity and apprentice mindset motivate concrete actions (coaxing the light, decoding the hopscotch, mapping), and the choice to keep the discovery secret adds a minor complication. Interiority is present through tactile focuses (scratch of pen, glow) but contradictory impulses are light and never truly test their values. Emotional embodiment is steady if somewhat safe. The final readiness reads earned but cost (fatigue, secrecy) is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s motive—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is clear and consistent, and actions align (study, decipher, open). However, interior conflict is minimal; there’s little friction or contradictory impulse as pressure rises. The epiphany feels largely granted rather than earned by visible costs on the page. Emotional embodiment skews abstract and serene rather than stressed or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria’s motive (to orchestrate a collective effort) is clear but interiority and contradictory impulses are largely absent; we’re told her aims rather than feeling them under pressure. Lyra is named yet functions as color rather than a crucible. Actions align with motives, but micro-choices and embodied emotion at key beats are missing. The resolution requires little personal cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.6)
    The adjuster’s motive—guard the fragile balance of time—is clear and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (minute adjustments, lullaby). However, interior contradiction is thin; “a burden of bruised awe” is asserted more than dramatized under pressure. The puppet head stirs feeling but doesn’t reveal a competing impulse or mistake. Emotional progression is steady rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (restore the labyrinth to guide travelers), and a few embodied touches land (“a shiver run down her spine”). However, interior conflict is minimal; she moves from reluctance to determination without friction or a meaningful trade‑off. The arc reads competent and tidy rather than pressured and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maria’s motive (grief, atonement) is clear and consistent, and the polymer-chemist lens adds a concrete facet to her inner life. However, the emotional texture leans generic (“sense of peace,” “solace”) with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift from grief to purpose feels largely told rather than wrestled. No on‑page micro‑choice carries visible cost beyond an internal reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ember’s contradictory impulses—urge to “incise” the bottle vs. honoring the vendor’s creed—surface clearly and drive the key choice. Interiority stays largely abstract and declarative (“sense of purpose,” “clarity”) rather than embodied. The renunciation is credible but the on‑page cost is soft. Still, actions align with motives and reveal character under gentle pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive—“to sandpaper rough memories”—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it. However, interiority leans abstract and declarative, with limited contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The big choice (entering and enduring the pavilion’s flood) is present but lands without a sharply felt personal cost. The result reads purposeful but emotionally moderated rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Emilia’s motive—“construct bridges from silos”—is clear and consistent, and her gentle persuasion aligns with her “empathetically decisive” trait. However, internal contradiction is minimal and stress never meaningfully degrades or complicates her thinking. Key actions (climbing, addressing the elevator) carry little visible cost. The grain elevator’s “rusty voice” offers no real resistance to force deeper choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (restore the mirror to access entangled memories), but internal contradiction is faint; the “exhilarating and unsettling” note appears, then resolves without a pressured choice. Interiority leans abstract and labeled rather than embodied, muting specificity. Micro-choices exist (analyzing, reassembling), yet costs tied to them remain largely declarative. The ending stance shift is credible but lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (seek “forgotten combinations”/“seeds of vigilance”), and actions align, but interior conflict is minimal and largely untested. Emotions skew declarative (“felt an intense urge,” “a reminder of the responsibility”) rather than embodied contradiction. Competence feels frictionless; no genuine mistake or flaw compounds the pressure. The ending stance (“responsibility”) lands, but the cost reads light.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sculptor’s motivation is clear and sustained—restore felt music to a silent world—but internal contradiction is minimal and risk is low. Embodied craft details (soil-stained fingers, harmonics, strings between trees) reveal character through action. Choices—unearthed insulator, analysis of cracks, integration—align with motive. The final stance (silence reweighted, not erased) is credible, if achieved without much visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear single-POV interiority with specific vocation, but feelings are largely summarized and unpressured. The tutor’s vow and renewed purpose read credible yet low-cost and near-platitudinous. Contradictory impulses are muted; melancholy and hope alternate rather than collide. Little embodied micro-choice beyond rising and walking away.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to “recover the secrets” and catalog silence) is clear but mostly declared rather than tested. Internal conflict is minimal—reading a friend’s private diary hints at an ethical tension but the text neutralizes it via the clasp’s “ethereal” consent. Embodied emotion and sensory perception are vivid yet rarely complicate choice. The ending’s stance (carry the lessons forward) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra’s desire and competence are clear, but she faces little counter‑pressure and exhibits minimal contradiction or costly choice. Her epiphany (“the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered…”) arrives without struggle on the page. Actions (buying and tending the seed, journaling) align with motives yet never test her values. The “guardian” status in the coda reads granted more than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (discover the orchard’s resilience) and consistent, but internal contradiction is minimal and emotions are often told rather than embodied. The strongest human beat is the inexplicable pull toward the broken arrow tip, which hints at depth but isn’t worked under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (follow accelerated growth, land at the pool), yet none carry visible cost beyond awe. Competence dominates struggle, limiting revelation of character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks to understand the crash and “cultivate foresight in action.” However, internal contradiction and on‑page micro‑choices are limited; she mostly observes and records. The “obsession” is told more than dramatized. The final stance (renewed determination) is credible but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent (to “certify wonder”), but interiority is generalized and largely declarative, with little embodied conflict or cost. Elian faces minimal resistance; her competence is never in doubt. The piece lacks contradictory impulses in scene that would complicate her choice. The closing serenity lands without a discernible personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Her drive and history are clear, and choosing to play the flute is a credible act aligned with her motive. Internal conflict is gestured at (“failures taught her the most”), but contradictory impulses don’t pressure an on‑page decision beyond the decision to play. Embodied emotion is present in sensory filtering but rarely complicates choice. The transformation reads more as affirmed resolve than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.6)
    Echo’s drive is clear and specific, and the obsession reads, but interior conflict is summarized rather than dramatized (“one moment…poet; the next, scientist”). Micro‑choices under pressure are limited beyond inserting the fragment and printing. Emotional embodiment leans abstract (“exhilarating and terrifying”) rather than idiosyncratic. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.0)
    Eira’s motive—keeping wonder alive while couriering relics—is clear, and the pendant modulates her anxiety credibly. However, she faces little pressure and makes no consequential choice; the ethereal encounter reframes mood rather than forcing action. Interiority is gentle but generalized, with limited contradiction or embodied cost. The “jittery” trait is asserted more than dramatized under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.6)
    Motivation is explicit (to prove objects absorb emotions), but the mystic faces little on‑page resistance and makes few micro‑choices beyond attention. Interiority is generalized and leans on abstractions (“truthful lies,” “profound truth”) rather than character‑particular contradiction. The final “realization” reads unearned because no tangible cost or trade‑off is dramatized. The character feels more like a vessel for theme than a pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear (reconnect across distance), and she takes a few concrete actions (assembling the puzzle, recommitting, rising to depart). However, interiority leans abstract and repetitive, with little embodied contradiction or micro‑choices under pressure; the shift from despair to resolve is asserted rather than dramatized. The “latent sacrifice” is told instead of tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear motive (forge resilience; prove quiet skill) and consistent temperament, but little on‑page contradiction or cost under pressure. Emotions skew summarized (“sweet scent of success,” “azure defiance”) over embodied conflict. The acceptance of the apprentice hints at a values shift, yet the choice arrives without meaningful resistance. Competence dominates; struggle remains mostly off‑stage.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (to uncover a withheld truth) but interiority is generic and repetitive (“she felt,” “she knew”) with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The map maker rarely makes fraught micro‑choices; she mostly observes and proceeds. Emotional embodiment leans on summary rather than specific, character‑particular reactions. The final reconfiguration (“she would never see the multiverse in the same way again”) isn’t earned through on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    The skipper’s motives (guarding the lighthouse, seeking safety) are clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (pocketing the glass, building the cairn, resolving to protect) reveal him. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific through observation rather than analysis. However, internal contradiction and felt cost remain mild; the ache soothes rather than forcing a difficult trade‑off. The Earned Stasis is credible but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    The herald’s motive (upholding ancient ritual to “steer the dawn”) is clear, but interior conflict is thin and largely declarative. Micro-choices exist (angling the lantern, trimming the wick) yet they don’t force a costly trade-off. Emotion skews summarized (“shadowed elation”) over embodied specificity. The end acknowledges responsibility but no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kaito’s motive (to decode allure via the wing) is clear and consistent, and his embodied precision with tea and light grounds him. However, internal contradiction is faint; “iridescent caution” suggests risk but never forces an on‑page trade‑off. Micro‑choices (positioning the wing, pouring tea) reveal temperament more than pressure. The final acceptance feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.6)
    The worker’s motive (drawn to broken things; moonlit healer) is clear and consistent, and their micro‑choices (picking up the sextant; choosing to map dreams) align. However, interior conflict is minimal—there’s little simultaneous push‑pull beyond a “steady hum” of sorrow. The healing reads largely assured rather than contested, which limits felt cost. The late addition of “what the trees witnessed” widens motive without pressing the on‑page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear (preserve memories, rekindle a dying realm) and actions align (touching the mica window, singing), but there’s little internal contradiction or cost. Interiority leans declarative and mission‑driven rather than pressured or particular. The final “renewed determination” reads earned enough but not tested by a difficult trade‑off. A second force on the page pressing her choices is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elys’s interiority is coherent (the recluse drawn to paradox and the library) and choices align with motives (continuing the search, repricing the invitation). However, contradictory impulses are muted; “staying while leaving” is stated more than dramatized under pressure. The emotional turn reads tidy and low-cost. Embodied feeling surfaces (“musty scent,” lantern glow) but often defaults to labels over specific, pressured action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.9)
    The noticer’s yearning for peace and “the sacred in the ordinary” is present, but her choices are limited to returning, sipping tea, and watching; internal contradiction and cost remain abstract. The gardener’s presence offers a relational mirror, not real pressure. The hinted guilt (“past transgressions”) lacks specific embodiment, blunting motivation escalation. The closing gratitude reads earned emotionally but not stress‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive—preserving and decoding the “luminous vows”—is clear and consistent, but her interior conflict is minimal and largely unopposed. We get little embodied emotion beyond a “thrill of excitement” and awe; most feeling is summarized lyrically. Her micro-choices (lifting, sorting, sampling, returning) align with her trait of meticulousness but lack a consequential trade‑off. The closing realization reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lena’s goal (find the fob, confront The Shadow) is clear, but interiority stays generic (“her heart quickened,” “determination”) with little contradictory impulse beyond a mild “excitement and unease.” Her micro‑choices—buying the fob, stepping toward The Shadow—track with motive, yet cost or flaw exposure is muted. The relationship pressure with The Shadow is gestured at, not truly dramatized. The ending claims growth without a visible trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, specific motivation (a skeptic drawn to inherited mystery) and embodied perception (taste, scent, cold) ground Aria. Her contradiction—science vs. mystical pull—is present but resolves too easily into acceptance at the touch, with little on‑page cost. Micro‑choices exist (coming to the bluff, attending to taste, choosing to approach and touch), yet struggle feels pre‑decided. The resulting change reads more as assent than a hard‑won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (rectify a creative block) and actions align, but internal contradiction is thin; she pivots to creating without meaningful resistance. Interiority leans on abstractions (“auroral sorrow”) more than character‑particular texture. The mnemonic gift briefly affects process but doesn’t complicate choices. The closing peace feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (she seeks candor and the “place where lost conversations go”), but interior conflict is minimal and mostly summarized. Embodied emotion appears rarely, with little contradiction under pressure. The final change to “newfound purpose” is stated rather than earned through on‑page strain. Choices read as steady, not contested.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria’s motive (preserving the “color of wonder” and attuning truth) is clear, but she faces little pressure and almost no contradictory impulses. Her key choice—incorporating the iceberg fragment—lacks resistance or cost. Interiority is summarized rather than embodied under stress. The ending smile lands without a felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s motive (resolve “inner static” while protecting the farm) is clear and consistent, and she makes concrete containment choices under pressure. However, interiority leans on abstract labels (“inner static,” “fragmented wholeness”) rather than embodied contradictions. The fear‑box motif gestures at vulnerability but rarely drives on‑page micro‑choices. Emotional cost is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia’s curiosity and belief in listening motivate action, but interior contradiction is thin and largely summarized. Her choices (inquiring, reading, arranging a meeting) align with character yet occur with little embodied pressure. The writer remains mostly a function, not a crucible; status dynamics and cost are soft. The closing gesture with the locket signals a shift, but without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s motive—escape via decoding—reads clear and consistent, with the dice and journal revealing character. Interiority is present but skews declarative (“encrypt her vulnerability as strength”), limiting contradictory impulses under pressure. The dance impulse offers texture but rarely forces a trade‑off or mistake. The closing choice to leave feels earned but low on embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear desire (to recover/deleted memories) and a few embodied beats (the leather book; trepidation at the crystal), but interior contradiction remains thin. Agency exists—ritual, descent, touch—but emotions are largely generalized (“sense of wonder”). The trepidation vs. compulsion at the crystal hints at complexity yet isn’t tested by a concrete price. Character reads competent and calm throughout, muting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation (to hush the prophecy) is clear, but interiority stays generalized and unconflicted; the summoner rarely confronts a contradictory impulse on the page. Actions align with stated purpose, yet we don’t see struggle beyond “tirelessly” working. The release of the wing is serene, not a pressured choice with visible cost. Character reads as archetype rather than particular individual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivations are clear (student seeks the “language of old buildings,” tutor mentors), but interiority is thin and largely told. There’s minimal contradictory impulse or embodied pressure on either party. The tutor’s gift of the seal isn’t paid for by a visible cost or moral trade‑off. Relationship dynamics stay warm and static rather than crucible‑like.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lyra’s motive (reclaiming suppressed memory to convert isolation into independence) is clear, but her interiority leans on abstract labels (“ghostly resolve,” “melancholic whispers”) over embodied contradiction. The key choice—deciding to “archive the seashell’s whispers”—is under-dramatized and yields little on-page struggle or cost. Interiority remains coherent but generalized; we rarely see conflicting impulses occupying the same moment. The change at dawn feels earned enough, yet psychologically smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear—subvert the historical text and “forgive the unfinished”—but internal conflict is minimal and largely asserted. The forger seldom faces a live trade‑off; mastery smooths over struggle. Emotions skew abstract and ceremonial rather than embodied under pressure. The final peace reads earned in tone more than in contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aria’s goal is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans declarative (“employed a method of progressive disclosure”) rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. The primary actions—listening and singing—don’t force tough micro‑choices or reveal limits. She gains understanding, yet the cost or renunciation is soft. The piece lacks a crucible with another on‑page presence to sharpen her motives.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s motive—salvaging something pure by exposing hidden patterns—is clear, and her actions (touching the globe, tracing the pattern, stepping out) align. However, interior contradiction is thin; she rarely struggles against herself or pays a visible personal price. Moments like her “gift and curse” label don’t translate into pressured choices. The character remains textured but largely passive and untested.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clear desire (to perceive “hidden patterns”) but little pressure tests it; interiority leans to labels over contradiction. Micro-choices (following the moon path, sitting with the whisk) don’t reveal competing impulses or cost. The epiphany (“she knew that she had finally grasped the truth”) reads unearned. Competence and wonder are steady without a crucible to force trade‑offs.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motive (debunker driven to expose lies) is clear and aligns with her choices (following the trail, reassembling letters, pushing into the orchard). However, interior conflict is thin—she rarely wavers or pays a visible price, and the “feeling watched” never forces a moral or tactical trade‑off. Embodied emotion is present (shiver, awe) but generic. The final stance shift is curiosity widening, not a conflicted renunciation or costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    The visionary remains an archetype rather than an individual; her motives are stated but not tested in scene. Micro-choices are largely “to listen more” and “to guide,” with no embodied hesitation or contradiction. Emotional texture is told, not dramatized, so no felt cost at the end. The prophet functions off-stage, denying relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is clear and textured—weariness, tenderness with objects, and the ache for purpose read credibly—but the internal conflict remains soft, with little on-page friction between competing impulses. His shift from paralysis to writing is emotionally legible yet lightly earned. Micro-choices (winding the music box, selecting a jar, sitting to write) reveal values, but none carry visible cost beyond sentiment. The “translator between generations” motive feels stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Azure’s motive (protect and tune the artifact) is clear and consistent, and her competence is legible, but internal contradiction is minimal and largely told (“logically emotional”) rather than dramatized under pressure. Embodied emotion lands in places (ice creak through her body) yet decisions rarely carry visible cost. Micro‑choices exist (attuning to creaks, proceeding despite fragile ice) but never force a trade‑off. The ending’s satisfaction reads earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clear motive (to initiate a “patient revolution”) and a consistent internal stance, but little lived contradiction or cost on the page. Most beats are observation and assertion rather than pressured micro-choices. The key action—raising her hands—feels symbolically motivated but not hard-won through conflicting impulses. Emotional embodiment stays general (“determination,” “excitement”) rather than character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is stated (solve a preventable death; free herself from the past), but micro-choices under pressure are thin—she mostly walks and reflects. “Watchfully calm” is labeled rather than dramatized with cost. The inscription “Free at last” triggers a realization yet feels a touch programmatic, risking unearned epiphany. Still, interiority is consistent and coherent for a single‑POV lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear interior motive (atonement for a past failure) and a gentle shift to renewed purpose land, but the chaplain’s conflict reads tidy and largely unopposed. Interiority leans abstract and generalized (“to deserve a second chance”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The proprietor’s presence offers little direct pressure on choice. Final resolve feels earned enough but low‑cost and low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is explicit (curiosity; ring the unheard bell), but interiority remains generalized and low‑friction. We rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied stress that forces trade‑offs. Actions track the stated goal, yet cost is barely felt. The final shift reads as fulfillment more than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.6)
    Motivation is clear (find the truth, fill a personal void), but interiority remains mostly told rather than dramatized through specific micro‑choices. Emotional beats lean on summary (“she realized…”) with minimal embodied contradiction. The late admission about self‑deception is thematically apt but arrives as statement, not a pressured turn. Change at the end reads credible but under-earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is explicit (“to map empathy onto action”), but it remains abstract and faces little on‑page resistance. Interiority leans on labels (“courageous anomaly,” “calmly intuitive”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her micro‑choices (seeking mirrors, piecing crystal) show competence without visible cost. The final acceptance of duty reads as gentle resolve rather than a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (cold air stinging, creaky dock, hauling debris), and the contradiction—wanting escape yet choosing to work—reads credibly. The shift from “desire to escape” to “desire to learn” is earned through the volunteering beats. However, micro-choices under pressure are limited; the labor functions more as balm than a test. Occasional abstract labels (“gift,” “second chance”) dilute the particularity of feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    The sentinel’s desire to “nurture intersubjective understanding” is consistent but abstract, yielding observation over pressured choice. Interiority is gentle and sincere yet largely unconflicted; contradictory impulses rarely act simultaneously. Her micro‑choices (wandering, keeping the letter fragment) reveal values but face little on‑page cost. The final resolve reads as acceptance rather than a hard‑won renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The line walker’s motive (preserve the prophet’s wisdom) is clear and actions align (consecrating, weaving the clearing), but internal contradiction never meaningfully complicates a choice. “Strangely honest” registers as a label without on‑page cost. Emotional experience is more narrated serenity than embodied struggle. The relationship with the prophet doesn’t pressure the protagonist beyond reverent compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.9)
    Luna’s motive (to make healing art) is clear and consistent, but she’s not pressured into any difficult or revealing choice. Interiority is mostly serene observation without contradictory impulses. Her “perceptively calm” trait reads as label, not a limiter or cost. Actions align with motives, yet no meaningful change or renunciation occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scholar’s reticence versus duty is credible and embodied (ink‑stained fingers, red‑rimmed eyes), and the micro‑choice to rise and go lands with felt cost. Interiority is specific enough to avoid stock abstraction. The visitor applies direct pressure, sharpening the ambivalence. The ultimate resolve is earned but remains quiet, with limited contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear desire (to capture/locate the sound of aging) and tactile micro-choices (chalk grip, driftwood placement) ground her. The “precognitive forgetfulness” offers a credible constraint, though its cost is lightly sketched. Emotional texture leans abstract at times, limiting contradictory impulses on the page. The closing renunciation/acceptance reads earned but could show sharper internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear, consistent motives (repair, wonder, “harness the ephemeral”) and some embodied labor under pressure, but interior conflict remains abstract and largely unopposed. The epiphany that escape velocity equals self‑transcendence is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. Micro‑choices exist (repair vs. fortify), yet they carry little visible cost. The “luminous ache” repeats as label more than dramatized feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lena’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority is largely told rather than embodied, with few contradictory impulses under pressure. Her “decisively kind” stance doesn’t encounter friction or visible cost beyond gentle sorrow. Emma’s presence is reactive, not pressuring Lena into harder choices. The shard of vinyl reveals tenderness but not a deeper, unique flaw or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (understand shadows at noon), but internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are minimal. Emotions and thought are largely summarized rather than embodied. Her “quietly deliberate” trait is told more than tested. The final realization carries little felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.0)
    Emilia’s interior tilt from doubt to purpose is legible, but it’s achieved largely through summarized reflection rather than embodied micro‑choices under pressure. The “forgiving skeptic” trait never meaningfully constrains her behavior; she accepts the tooth’s promise with minimal friction. The nostalgia/innovation tension is named but not dramatized in action. The final resolve to embark feels pleasant yet low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clear motive (share light without fire) but the interiority leans generic and largely unconflicted; we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. Choices are limited to continuing to polish, with no visible trade-off beyond patience. Emotional states are summarized (“sense of purpose,” “peace”) rather than embodied through distinct, character-particular texture. The ending’s stance feels earned by repetition, not by a micro‑crisis that forces a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    Aria’s motives (seeking solace, “quietly proactive”) are clear, but interior conflict is muted and often told rather than dramatized. The acceptance of the flower is gentle but low‑pressure; contradictory impulses rarely act simultaneously. The bond with the figure reads as support more than a crucible for choice. The reweighting of the pendant lands, but without a visible on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (fear of failure vs urge to write), but interiority often arrives as abstraction (“she realized… guiding her”) rather than pressure‑shaped micro‑choices. Embodied emotion is light; beyond gazing and writing, there’s little behavior under strain. The apparition helps, yet the writer’s reversal feels low‑cost and swiftly tidy. Change occurs, but ambiguity and contradiction aren’t fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motive—restore sacred practices—is clear and consistent, but she faces little resistance and shows minimal internal contradiction. Interiority remains generalized (“a lingering sense of longing”) rather than character‑particular under pressure. Her micro‑choices (tuning gears, activating the device) reveal competence, not struggle. The ending’s satisfaction isn’t purchased by a visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—Aria wants to enchant the plate to “translate heartbeats into maps,” and her deliberate, ritualized actions align. Internal conflict is gestured at (“turmoil of emotions within her”) but not dramatized through contradictory choices, keeping complexity modest. The visible cost (a drop of her essence; exhaustion) supports credibility. Overall, character reads specific but largely competent and steady rather than pressured into revealing contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elian’s curiosity and “cellar of reason” impulse give him a credible, consistent motive, and his occupational lens colors perception nicely. However, internal conflict is minimal; his competence glides without a palpable counter‑impulse or risk. The piece largely summarizes endurance rather than dramatizing micro‑choices under pressure. The ending’s satisfaction reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    Her motive—to “collect the weights of different burdens”—is clear, but her interiority remains largely serene and unconflicted, with few micro‑choices under pressure. The main actions (enter, weave, light/extinguish the lamp) don’t reveal contradiction or cost. The final endurance (quiet completion and departure) reads earned but low‑stakes. Emotional embodiment skews abstract over character‑particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear, specific motivation (ritual carving to manage grief) and embodied actions (handling ash wood, tea) ground the widow. However, interior tension is low; contradictory impulses rarely clash in scene, yielding a smooth path to acceptance. Emotional language occasionally trends generic (“hauntingly practical truth”), dulling character‑particular depth. The final renunciation/acceptance reads earned but modest in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scavenger’s motive—“to negotiate with their own ghost”—is clear and consistent, and the final click reads as an earned, quiet refusal/acceptance. However, interiority leans abstract, with little embodied contradiction under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (slow collecting, stopping at sunset, choosing to shoot) but are not tested against competing impulses on the page. The cost is implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maya’s motive (revive the terminal; “equations for hope”) is clear and consistent, and her occupational lens shapes what she notices and does. However, there’s little on‑page friction or contradictory impulse; she moves from curiosity to competence without real strain. The sextant’s “guiding” feels unearned as motivation rather than dramatized pressure. The final stance shift to hope isn’t paid for by a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s introversion and meticulous vocation color his perceptions, and his quiet choice to remain still as the bear approaches feels consistent. The internal conflict—stability as a scribe versus the abandoned naturalist dream—registers but remains low-pressure. His resolution to reconcile both paths is credible but comes with minimal felt cost. Embodied beats (heart pounding, stillness) help, though the turn reads more contemplative than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear (seek the sundial to decode “the architecture of lies”), but internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized; the late realization about self‑lies isn’t earned through on‑page contradictory impulses. Competence feels frictionless, minimizing felt cost. Micro‑choices are present (following subtle cues) but never pinch her values.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear motivation (preserve ancient methods) and competence are established, but internal contradiction is minimal and stakes never force a painful tradeoff. Her patience is stated and enacted, yet costs (cold, time, risk) remain abstract. The fulgurite memory adds texture but doesn’t expose a fault line. The final satisfaction arrives without visible struggle that would test her values.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear desire—to “understand the geography of healing”—and a consistent vocation anchor the POV, with tactile micro‑choices (touching the weft, choosing to write, deciding to leave). Internal contradiction is mild: melancholy vs. a need to connect, not strongly dramatized under pressure. The ending acceptance reads earned through the act of writing, but the personal cost remains soft. Embodied emotion is present but leans generalized rather than idiosyncratically revealing flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (restore beauty), and the prince’s actions (handling the egg, assembling the device) align with it. Interiority leans abstract (“bitterly sweet nostalgia,” “sense of wonder”) rather than character‑particular. Contradictory impulses (hope/trepidation) are present but lightly dramatized, with minimal embodied cost. The final shift feels felt but not earned through difficult micro‑choices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s vocation and lineage create a promising contradiction, but the piece cushions it with affirmation rather than dramatized friction. The only concrete pressure—saving a charred sapling via graft—never strains her competence or ethics. Interiority is lyrical yet generalized; the “scars can sing” mantra is asserted rather than earned in a contested moment. Choices align with motives but without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motive (liberate trapped memories) is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction and pressure-tested micro-choices are minimal. Labels (“luminous skeptic,” “sidereal patience”) substitute for embodied conflict. The key decision—opening the box—arrives without a credible internal struggle or cost. The vow of guardianship hints at a change, but it’s stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist’s motive—share light without fire—is clear but largely declared, not stress-tested. Interiority is generalized (“troubling serenity”) with minimal contradictory impulses in scene. The only micro-choices (holding the gear, increasing sonar pings) do not force trade-offs. Change at the end reads as endurance rather than a choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear desire and profession-grounded actions (chiseling, ribbon, poem) but few pressured micro-choices or contradictory impulses on the page. The mentor relationship adds warmth but exerts little immediate pressure. Interiority leans reflective rather than dramatized struggle. The final acceptance reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s guilt versus disciplined duty creates a credible inner tension, and the rake-handle inscription prompts a micro‑choice to move toward restitution. However, her interiority leans on abstractions (“incremental absolution,” “restore shared balance”) rather than distinct, character‑particular thought. Embodied emotion appears (salt, seaweed, waves) but rarely complicates her stance under pressure. The final renunciation is gentle and earned, yet the cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear (to decode the echoes’ “shape of intentions”), but interior conflict is minimal and largely summarized rather than dramatized. The gardener’s tenderness informs action (lavender sachets, patience untangling), yet we seldom see contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional costs are implied (obsessive devotion, time) rather than made legible in a charged choice. The final renewed purpose reads earned enough, but light on visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is explicit (break stagnation; seed innovation within constraint), but interiority remains generalized and largely unopposed. The cartographer faces little contradictory impulse or embodied cost; desire and action align smoothly. Micro‑choices (attaching the nib, hovering) do not reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The result reads more like a stated mission than a character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Emilia’s goal and professional specificity (copyist transcribing under pressure) are clear and consistent, and her obsession reads plausibly. However, interior contradiction is thin: the piece favors rapture over competing impulses, so the peak never tests her values beyond attention and endurance. Embodied beats (dial twirling, pencil scratching, cloak) reveal character but not a hard trade‑off. The closing self‑appointment as “guardian” feels earned in tone, not via a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lena’s vocation and reverent temperament are clear, and her choice to proceed with scattering offers a modest on‑page turn. However, conflicting impulses (duty vs. reluctance) are largely told rather than dramatized, so pressure never sharpens into a costly choice. Interiority leans generic and declarative, with minimal embodied contradiction. Eli’s presence doesn’t materially pressure her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear, coherent interiority and motive (preserve ancient methods; reject the “official story”), with small embodied costs (raw, blistered hands). However, internal contradiction rarely acts simultaneously in scene; the “agonizing” is summarized more than dramatized. Micro-choices are modest (turning the cog, continuing to dig) rather than pressure-forced. The final endurance stance reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    Emilia’s motivation—braiding diverse voices into harmony and unlearning hatred—is clear and consistent, and her handling of the zither reveals tenderness and purpose. However, she faces little immediate pressure on the page, so contradictory impulses rarely clash in scene. The decisive “resolve to continue” feels earned but low-cost. Interiority is sincere yet generalized, with few character-specific tells beyond her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aria’s motive and actions are clear (prune, plant, cook), but she faces little friction and shows limited contradictory impulses. Interiority leans declarative (“informally wise,” “gentle rebellion”) rather than embodied conflict. The final recognition of healing reads earned but low-cost. A stronger on‑page dilemma would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The toll keeper’s curiosity and candor motivate the investigation, but interior contradiction is minimal and largely told rather than dramatized. The “involuntarily truthful” trait seldom constrains behavior with cost. The dynamic with the woman is functional but lacks status shifts or pressure-tested choices. The ending’s stance reads as calm assurance rather than an earned renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear—Eli’s compulsion to understand “alive” houses—but interiority leans abstract and low-conflict. Her choices (buying the shard, performing the ritual) align with that aim, yet contradictory impulses or cost are underplayed. Embodied emotion is muted, with generalized awe more than character-particular texture. The change at the end is asserted as humbling rather than dramatized with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    The statue’s gentleness and curiosity motivate its outreach to the parrotfish and the catching of the ampoule, but interior conflict and micro‑choices under pressure are minimal. Emotions are mostly summarized (“incisively kind”) rather than embodied. The “comforting” and “sharing” scenes assert motive without dramatizing cost. Change feels earned conceptually, not through on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation (to crack perpetual motion; to capture a missed opportunity) is clear and consistent, but interiority leans abstract and repetitive rather than embodied under pressure. Micro‑choices are thin—rolling the dice and continuing to climb—with little visible trade‑off beyond mood. The final acceptance (“I was content to be bound”) reads as endurance rather than a turn earned by conflict. Specific embodied contradiction is limited, despite hints (grim optimism vs. obsession).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear desire (reviving lost languages; proving kindness endures) and a decisive micro‑choice (picking up the brush) land. However, internal contradiction is light—there’s little felt resistance beyond contemplation—so the change reads more like affirmation than earned struggle. Embodied emotion appears, but often in generalized lyric gestures. The final commitment to return carries intention but little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elena’s motive to preserve cultural memory is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Her actions (guiding, interpreting) reveal values, yet she faces little on‑page pressure to make a costly choice. The final resolve to be a guardian reads as earnest but low‑friction. Stronger micro‑choices under strain would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation (curiosity/compulsion to uncover secrets) is clear and consistent, but interiority leans generic and declarative rather than character‑particular. There’s little contradiction or friction in his impulses; he proceeds competently without missteps or moral calculus. Embodied emotion surfaces (“wind whipping,” “heart pounded”) but repeats without deepening. The final “never be the same” feels asserted rather than earned through a visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear curiosity-versus-fear drive with small micro-choices (examining the clasp, flipping the dictionary, facing the mirror), but interiority relies on generic formulations and repeated phrasing. The “whispering advisor” externalizes pressure, leaving the protagonist’s contradictory impulses underdeveloped. Embodied emotion skews toward clichés (“black as coal,” “siren’s call”) rather than character‑specific textures. The final endurance/renunciation (leaving, haunted) lands but feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clear motive (“turn obstacles into instruments”) and embodied actions (bare feet, chest heaving) land, but there’s little interior contradiction or pressure to force a difficult choice. She reads more as a figure than a psyche. The vanishing lacks a felt personal cost or reconfigured stance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s motive (curiosity vs dread) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices—deciphering, blowing the whistle, stepping beyond the boundary—track with “quietly driven.” We do get a live contradiction (unease yet she proceeds), though the interiority leans on generic feeling tags (“felt a sense of dread”) rather than idiosyncratic embodiment. No relationship crucible on the page, so pressure is purely situational. The final stance is earned but the visible cost remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation is clear (a historian intent on exposing “noble lies”), but interiority remains generic and largely declarative. We get little contradictory impulse or embodied struggle; she proceeds competently without friction. The “emotionally rational” trait is told rather than dramatized. The final satisfaction arrives without any visible cost that would reveal deeper character.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    The surveyor has a clear, consistent motive and an idiosyncratic vocation, but interiority leans abstract and repetitive rather than embodied. The only real micro-choices are retrieving the inkwell and choosing to leave it behind—both low-pressure. “Stoically sensitive” reads as label more than dramatized contradiction. The closing smile signals earned stasis, but the cost is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive (to trace honest origins) is clear and sustains her actions, but she faces little internal contradiction or live resistance on the page. The “readjust” to an alternative hypothesis marks a credible micro‑choice. Emotional texture stays largely serene, so the final “transformation” reads modest rather than hard‑won. Cost is implied (isolation, time) rather than felt in a specific beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear (transmuting grief through craft) and embodied in tactile work; the release of the crane and the return to the bench are credible micro-choices. Internal contradiction (yearning for transcendence vs. accepting the slow work) is present but stays gentle. Emotional textures are specific to his vocation, though pressure rarely forces a hard trade-off. The arc lands as an earned stasis more than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    Amira’s motivation is clear (shock to purpose), and her decision to go to the observatory provides a credible throughline. However, interiority leans on generalities (“sense of purpose,” “awakening”) rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Dr. Patel remains a flat facilitator, providing little crucible pressure. The final stance feels earned but low-cost, more declared than wrestled onto the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear (decode the “frequency of belonging”), and her competence as a drone pilot grounds actions, but interiority stays general with limited contradiction under pressure. The “perpetually surprised by beauty” trait doesn’t complicate choices. The late realization reads more like a tidy reframing than a costly change. Emotional texture is present but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, specific interiority (guilt, unease, professional self-awareness) and a few micro-choices (walking the shore; deciding to proceed) reveal character. Contradictory impulses—complicity in fabrication versus hunger for truth—are present but not stress‑tested beyond reflection. Embodiment via setting is effective, though some emotion is stated rather than dramatized. Final resolve carries a modest felt cost but stops short of a sharpened, on‑page trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear motive and professional stance, but interior conflict is thin: she never wavers, and contradictory impulses don’t pressure a choice. Her “calm determination” yields no visible cost. Micro-choices (touching the drawer pull, speaking) don’t alter tactics in-scene so much as announce them. Strong role definition, limited struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (seeking purpose after divorce), but the interiority leans on labeled states and tidy realizations rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. Jack’s choices (paddling, using poles) are gentle and low-cost. The “merrily melancholic” trait is told more than dramatized. The closing resolve reads earned enough but soft, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation (to “kindle empathy”) is clear, but Lena’s interiority leans on generalized phrasing and repeated declarations over particular contradictions or embodied tension. Her micro‑choices—picking up the box, following the path—are modest and largely uncontested. The “clean slate seeker” premise is compelling, yet the on‑page cost of that identity never pressures a decision. Emotional texture stays steady rather than fracturing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lyra’s motive (aid Aria; face a reluctant metamorphosis) is clear and consistent, with some embodied feeling during the ritual. However, contradictory impulses are mostly declared rather than dramatized through on‑page micro‑choices under pressure. Aria registers as determined but remains thin beyond her mission. The final acceptance reads as growth, but the cost to Lyra’s former life is more told than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.6)
    Her desire to understand “cloudbound repentance” and recover lost time is clear and consistent, with a modest arc from yearning to acceptance. Interiority is specific in image but light on contradictory impulses in-the-moment and on micro‑choices under pressure. The key action—opening the book—reveals tenderness and cost, but the emotional turn feels gently arrived at rather than hard‑won. Overall, credible and coherent, if low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.6)
    Aurora’s motive—to unlock a locked dimension through shadow work—is clear and consistent, and her calm, ritual action aligns with a pacifist’s tactics. Interiority is present but largely declarative (“undanted,” “steadfast”), with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro‑choices are constrained to stitching and attending to photographs; we don’t see a hard trade‑off or visible cost chosen in the moment. The implied fading at the end suggests a cost but is not meaningfully struggled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s desire to seek the unusual and her sensitivity to “nudges” are clear, and her skepticism versus resonance with the prophecy hints at contradiction. However, micro‑choices under pressure are thin—she largely receives rather than decides, with the main acts being touching the rock and accepting the bottle. The “destitute philanthropist” trait never pressures a choice. The final stance shift to “peace” lacks a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sentinel’s motive (guarding the cradle; answering the coded call) is clear, but she encounters little friction and exhibits minimal contradictory impulse. “Calmly inventive” is shown via decoding and hidden‑mechanism use, yet internal conflict is thin. The accomplice relationship arrives without tension and becomes instant alignment rather than a crucible. The final stance shift (choosing to act) lands but feels low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear (fulfilling the lingering promise by unlocking patterns), but internal conflict is thin and largely asserted (“precognitively cursed”) without a concrete, contradictory impulse on the page. Choices are calm and unpressured; the ritual unfolds without resistance. Emotional texture leans abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear motive (to map her scars) and a consistent interior lens, with the envelope choice as the key action. However, conflict is largely abstract and contradictory impulses are muted; she moves from poised waiting to reading with little on‑page resistance. Emotional texture leans on atmospheric mirroring rather than embodied friction. The “censored” facet is named but not dramatized in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aurélien’s goal is clear and consistent, and the mechanical arm offers a concrete trait under pressure. However, interior conflict is thin—he experiences little contradictory impulse beyond calm focus vs. anticipation. Micro‑choices are mostly summarized rather than dramatized, especially once the opponent arrives. The victory registers, but no path is foreclosed with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear—forge beauty from anarchy, rebuild as resistance—but internal contradiction (molting personas) is told, not dramatized under pressure. The friendship motive is moving yet functions as summary rather than a live crucible. Embodied emotion appears in small touches (coffee tin, moonlight) but peak choices lack felt cost. The final stance feels earned but a bit frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (grief seeking refuge) and credible contradictions (yearning to stay vs. choosing to return). Micro-choices—threading the reel, stepping into the film, playing an unplanned encore—reveal agency under pressure. Interiority is mostly image-led rather than deeply thought-specific, but embodied sensations (wet stone, ozone) keep it grounded. The final stance shift feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motivation (protecting collective memory) is clear, and her “luminous doubt” is named, but it rarely manifests in pressured micro‑choices. Most actions (planting the seed, interpreting dreams) occur without on‑page resistance or consequence. The internal conflict resolves tidily into conviction at the end without a visible cost. She reads more as an emblematic role than a fully individuated person under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaito’s motive—diffusing sorrow and seeking the color of unspoken apologies—is clear and drives tangible choices (pick up the compass, weave, release). Interiority is steady but leans abstract, with limited contradictory impulses beyond hold vs. let go. Embodiment is present through tactile actions (threading, wrapping) but often narrated in calm summary rather than pressured decision. The final renunciation reads earned, though the on‑page cost is gently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character, Maria, functions less as a person and more as a mouthpiece for the story's philosophical premise. Her interiority is abstract and overly articulate, reading like an essayist's voice rather than an individual's thoughts under specific circumstances. There is no dramatized internal conflict; her journey to epiphany is a smooth, linear process, and her profession as a neutron star researcher feels like a convenient label to lend intellectual weight rather than an integrated aspect of her character.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear but presented through summary and emotional labels ("felt a sense of disorientation," "felt a surge of curiosity") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the scene. Her internal journey is a smooth, linear progression from confusion to clarity without a visible struggle or trade-off. The story tells us she is "steadily adaptive," but this trait is not tested on the page; her epiphany arrives without any meaningful internal resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to create music from silence is clear and consistent. However, her interiority relies on some summary ("balm to her frazzled nerves," "catalyst for her creativity") and the emotion-mapping device externalizes her collaborator's inner state, serving as a shortcut that bypasses the need for more nuanced, embodied interaction. The characters are functional but lack the contradictory impulses needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    The undertaker's motivation is clear and thematically resonant, but his interiority is conveyed through summary rather than embodied action. Phrases like "felt an inexplicable pull" or "felt his weariness lifting" tell the reader his state instead of showing it through difficult choices. The "inadvertently stubborn" trait is asserted but never dramatized in a way that complicates his journey or forces a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.5)
    Akira's motivation is clear, but her characterization lacks depth. She is presented as uniformly competent and determined, without any visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. Her traits are described with labels like "gently persistent" and "quiet confidence" rather than being revealed through difficult choices with tangible costs in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but abstract, and her internal change feels asserted rather than earned. The resolution arrives via an external guide delivering a direct, thematic statement ("The love you seek is within..."), which sidesteps the internal struggle and reads as a diagnostic epiphany. Her character remains more of a vessel for the theme than a complex individual whose flaws complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elian's motivation is abstract ("to discover the texture of time") and their interiority is summarized with diagnostic labels ("retrocognitively trapped," "heightened awareness") rather than embodied. The character acts as a passive observer to a series of metaphysical events, reacting with generic awe or disorientation. The final change feels like an intellectual conclusion, not an earned transformation, as there is no visible cost or difficult choice made on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype, not a character. Labels like "patiently strategic" and "trained eye" substitute for demonstrated traits or internal conflict. Emotions are declared ("heart swelled with purpose") rather than embodied, and the character's flawless competence and lack of any discernible flaw or contradictory impulse flatten them into a symbolic cipher moving through a pre-ordained plot.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on some diagnostic self-awareness ("help her clients heal from emotional trauma") that feels more like a summary of intent than an embodied struggle. The internal conflict is presented as a steady, focused process rather than a dynamic battle between contradictory impulses, which lessens the tension of her creative act.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lumina’s motivation pivots cleanly from artistic pursuit to mystical quest, but their characterization remains thin, serving more as a lens for the atmosphere than a complex individual. Interiority relies on stock phrases like "fingers itched" and "a mix of excitement and trepidation," which label emotions rather than embodying them. The core identity of a "portrait thief" is underdeveloped, feeling like an aesthetic choice rather than a driver of specific, costly actions.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian's motivation is clear but delivered through summary rather than dramatized need. The interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "a protective shell of ice" and "thoughtfully spirited nature" instead of showing contradictory impulses in scene. The character's transformation feels asserted rather than earned through a tangible struggle or a choice with a visible, immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's central contradiction—a phobia-ridden stunt double—is stated but not dramatized effectively. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("firmly adaptive nature," "fear of failure") and therapy-speak ("prove that vulnerability is power") rather than embodied emotion. The final transformation from "phobia-ridden" to "ready to take on the world" feels abrupt and unearned, triggered by a simple coded phrase rather than a genuine internal struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The oracle’s motivation is clear—an overwhelming urge to map the night—and her actions are consistent with this goal. However, her characterization remains somewhat archetypal, defined by an "otherworldly intensity" rather than specific, contradictory impulses. The use of "mildly obsessed" feels at odds with the profound cosmic act she undertakes, slightly flattening the character's internal landscape and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.5)
    Zeta's motivation is clear, but its characterization is delivered through declarative statements and diagnostic labels rather than embodied experience. The repetitive assertion that Zeta is "remarkably composed" acts as a substitute for demonstrating the trait under pressure. The final epiphany feels more like an intellectual summary than an earned, emotional shift, as the interiority consistently tells the reader what Zeta thinks and feels instead of letting those states emerge from its perceptions and actions.

    The registrar’s motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, reading more like a thesis statement ("to thaw mistrust with transparency"). Her interiority relies on abstract labels and stock phrases ("felt a sense of resolve," "sense of clarity and purpose"), and the final change feels like an unearned epiphany. The character functions as a vessel for the theme, lacking the specific, contradictory impulses of a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dresser's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization relies heavily on summary rather than embodied action. Intriguing backstory elements like the "mended deception" are introduced as labels but never dramatized, leaving the character feeling more like a beautifully rendered archetype than a specific individual. The internal state is described effectively but lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelin's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on emotional labels rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "felt a sense of satisfaction" and "felt a sense of awe" summarize her interiority without dramatizing it. Her perfect competence and the absence of any internal conflict or struggle make her journey feel frictionless and her ultimate triumph less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rachel's motivation is clear but her internal state is conveyed through labels rather than embodied experience. The story asserts she feels a "surge of inspiration" and a "sense of peace" without dramatizing the internal shift. The final change feels disproportionate to the on-page struggle, reading more as a convenient epiphany than an earned transformation with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria’s characterization is subordinate to the story's theme. Her motivation—"to find the weight of the swallowed truth"—is abstract and never grounded in specific, personal history, making her feel more like a vessel for an idea than a person. The interiority relies heavily on intellectual labels ("newfound clarity," "provisional and ephemeral") rather than embodied emotion, and the final change is an intellectual realization without a deeply felt personal cost beyond a stated "sorrow."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is stated abstractly ("to find the weight of a similar truth") rather than dramatized through action. The defining trait of being "religiously skeptical" is immediately undermined by the character feeling watched and using a psychic's radio show as a tool, creating an un-interrogated contradiction rather than compelling internal conflict. Interiority relies on summary labels like "curiosity was piqued" and "sense of clarity," which feel told rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation is consistently stated but remains an abstract label rather than a deeply felt, contradictory impulse. The character is more of a functionary for the story's mood than an individual with complex interiority. The singular choice to burrow is significant, but it feels more like a passive yielding to an external force than a decision born of internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on stock phrasing like "happy place" and "stresses of the world seemed to melt away." The characterization of Eli's change is undercut by diagnostic summary ("It was a cautious exuberance...") rather than embodied through his specific actions or perceptions. Aria's character is consistent but lacks the memorable specificity or internal contradiction expected at a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains functional rather than deep. We are told she is an "odd historian" and "sensitively perceptive," but these traits operate as labels rather than driving specific, costly choices on the page. Her interiority relies on stock phrasing like "fingers itched to probe," and she proceeds through her investigation without facing any meaningful internal friction or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.5)
    The characterization of "The Oracle" relies on labels rather than demonstrated action or nuanced interiority. Phrases like "accidentally prophetic nature" and "familiar enigma" are asserted repeatedly but not embodied in specific, contradictory choices. The pivotal change feels unearned because the internal mechanism is summarized ("intuited," "sensed") rather than dramatized, resulting in a character who serves as a mannequin for thematic concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.5)
    The priest's motivation is clearly stated but remains abstract and intellectual ("illuminate hidden assumptions"). There is little to no dramatized internal conflict or character-particular interiority; he functions more as a thematic vessel than a person under pressure. His actions are a performance of a role, and we get no sense of his flaws, contradictions, or the personal cost of the ritual beyond a generalized focus.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's motivation is stated but not deeply dramatized; traits like "cryptic fortune cookie writer" and "chronologically homesick" function as evocative labels rather than drivers of concrete, contradictory choices on the page. The internal state is described with a high degree of abstraction, summarizing the longing rather than embodying it through specific, conflicting impulses in the present moment. The final resolution feels like a declared epiphany rather than a change earned through a difficult, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a collection of titles and abstract goals rather than a character. Motivation is stated ("determined to unravel its mysteries") but never felt, and interiority consists of conceptual labels like "familiar tug of her periodically eternal existence." The central struggle is summarized away—"she overcame through her mastery"—which completely removes any sense of risk, flaw, or earned change, making the final transformation feel hollow and preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria’s motivation to overcome "emotional numbness" is explicit and consistent. However, her interiority is conveyed through abstract labels ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush") rather than through specific, embodied contradictions. The characterization is a sustained, lyrical state rather than a dynamic process of struggle; we are told of the numbness but don't see it actively warring with her desire for feeling in a concrete, choice-driven moment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on telling rather than showing, with traits and motivations stated as labels (e.g., "credibly curious nature," "driven to nurture integrity in solitude"). The protagonist's internal state is summarized in stock phrases ("mind began to whirl," "heart quickened") instead of being embodied through specific, contradictory perceptions. While a final choice is made, it feels like a logical endpoint to a declared personality trait rather than an earned decision forged from genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on labeling emotions rather than embodying them. Phrases like "felt a pang," "felt the familiar sting," and "felt a sense of awe" summarize her state without providing concrete, character-particular expression. The central arc from sorrow to peace is legible, but the process reads as a series of declared emotional shifts rather than a messy, contradictory internal struggle played out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet’s motivation is consistently stated and her actions align with it, but her interiority lacks specificity. Phrases like "ethically playful grin" are asserted rather than demonstrated, and the character reads more as a thoughtful archetype than a complex individual with contradictory impulses. The emotional progression is a smooth, linear discovery rather than a struggle, which limits the depth of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.5)
    The violinist's motivation is clear but her interiority is rendered in generic terms ("feeling an inexplicable connection," "felt a sense of hope") rather than through a particularized consciousness. She functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with internal contradictions or complex embodied emotions. Her primary action—playing music—feels preordained rather than like a difficult choice arising from competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation and professional stance are clear and consistent. However, her interiority is more described than embodied, relying on summaries of her emotional state (e.g., "learned to subsume her own emotions") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the present moment. This creates a compelling portrait of mastery but lacks the dynamic internal conflict needed for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization is superficial. Lena's profession as a "shrewd... broker" is an unearned label that has no bearing on her actions, which are entirely sentimental. Her motivation to start a major community project materializes instantly from a single conversation, lacking any internal conflict or plausible psychological grounding. Both Lena and Sophia are idealized archetypes rather than flawed individuals, leading to a frictionless and predictable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear but remains a static label ("longing to belong") rather than an active, contradictory force within a scene. The character's core trait, "boldly sympathetic nature," is asserted but never demonstrated in a way that forces a difficult choice or carries a cost. The final transformation from an "ache" to "peace" is a tidy summary of a change, not an earned emotional state forged through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra's motivation is established clearly (to find the place where echoes are born), but her characterization remains thin. Her interiority relies on stock phrases like "insatiable drive" and "deep sense of connection" rather than specific, contradictory thought. The change at the end is declared ("she was forever changed") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with a felt cost, which limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conjurer's motivation is clear but abstract, relying heavily on diagnostic labels like "ambiguous loss" and "deep-seated desire" rather than embodied experience. Her interiority feels more like an authorial summary of psychological states than a specific, lived consciousness. The pivotal change—the "spark of understanding"—comes across as an unearned epiphany, lacking a strong causal link to the specific actions preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's core motivation ("to become visible") is introduced far too late and feels unearned. The shift from a reclusive, methodical scrap-hoarder to a benevolent provider of wonder for others is an abrupt, sentimental turn not supported by prior action or internal conflict. The character reads more as a kindly archetype than a specific individual with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.6)
    Emilia’s characterization relies on abstract, diagnostic labels rather than embodied experience. Her conflict is summarized with phrases like "circuitously sincere nature" and the "need for control," which reads more like a psychological profile than lived interiority. The shift from reluctance to determination is asserted in a single sentence without dramatizing the internal struggle, making her transformation feel intellectually conceived rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but primarily stated rather than embodied. Interiority relies on abstract labels like "solace," "trauma," and "a sense of unease" instead of specific, character-particular thoughts or physical sensations. The key choice to trade art for information is present, but the asserted cost of "bartering away a piece of myself" is not dramatized with sufficient internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria’s character is consistent, but her internal journey lacks friction. Her shift from being "taken aback" to curiosity and full acceptance is seamless and lacks the embodied internal conflict of a truly compelling transformation. The change is described in summary ("her abilities expanding," "she found herself growing more attuned") rather than dramatized through a moment of difficult choice or doubt, making the final epiphany feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. Interiority is conveyed through labels like "reactively visionary" and broad emotional statements ("felt a sense of absence") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. There is no on-page struggle or internal conflict; she conceives a plan and executes it with perfect success, making her feel more like a benevolent archetype than a flawed, compelling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    Emilia’s character is defined by labels ("meticulous route mapper," "analytically artistic") that are never dramatized through her choices or actions. Her motivation is a series of told feelings—"inexplicable connection," "trembling certainty"—rather than a demonstrated internal conflict. The transformation at the end feels unearned as it bypasses any genuine struggle, resulting in a character arc that is asserted rather than proven.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s defining trait, skepticism, is introduced only to be immediately nullified by the magical tile, erasing the primary source of internal conflict. Her motivation remains vague beyond "piqued interest," making her feel more like a passive lens for the story's atmosphere than a character with compelling, contradictory drives. Phrases like "courageously kind determination" are asserted as labels rather than demonstrated through costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael's motivation is clear and drives the entire plot, and the shift from boredom to awe is earned by the climax. The characterization is strong, but interiority leans slightly on labels ("wonder and trepidation") rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses acting in the moment, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s motivation shifts from a vague internal search to decisive action a bit too quickly, catalyzed more by her father’s approval (“You’re a natural, kiddo”) than a fully dramatized internal struggle. Her father is a functional but familiar "charming con artist" archetype. The characterization is clear but lacks the contradictory impulses and specific interiority needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stationer's motivation is clear and consistent, but it is delivered through direct statement rather than being fully embodied. Her interiority remains somewhat abstract ("eyes sparkled with intensity," "deep satisfaction"), lacking the internal conflict or contradictory impulses that would create a more dynamic character. She functions effectively as a lens for the story's themes, but the characterization itself is more archetypal than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    The character is more of a thematic vessel than a person. Motivation is clearly stated but never tested or complicated; there is no internal conflict, contradiction, or embodied emotion. Interiority consists of abstract statements about their purpose ("a need to understand the texture of memories") rather than a specific, lived-in perspective, making them a generic stand-in for the story's concept.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. However, her primary emotional state, "gloomy cheerfulness," is stated three times rather than fully embodied. This labeling prevents the interiority from feeling character-particular, making her seem more like a functional vessel for the plot than a person with complex, contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    Ava's motivation is clear, but her character is a collection of labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive nature," "dual allegiance") rather than a person with embodied emotions or internal conflict. We are told she feels "hopeful desperation," but we never experience it through her perceptions or choices. The character serves as a functional vehicle for the plot, lacking the specific, contradictory interiority required for a high-level piece.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on summary and emotional labels ("felt a sense of satisfaction," "felt a sense of dawnlit melancholy") rather than embodied experience. Her curiosity about the sand grain adds a nice layer, yet her internal state remains somewhat generic. There's little sense of a flawed individual over a competent professional performing a sad task.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    Emilia's motivation is clear, but she reads as an idealized artisan archetype rather than a complex individual. She displays flawless competence and serenity without any visible internal conflict, struggle, or contradictory impulses. The story presents her skills but doesn't test them against meaningful opposition, making her an admirable but emotionally distant figure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.5)
    Emilia’s motivation is clear, but her characterization remains on the surface. Key traits like "dry-witted" are stated but not demonstrated, and her internal state is often summarized with generic phrases ("felt a growing sense of urgency," "mind racing") rather than embodied in specific, contradictory actions. The internal turmoil mentioned is an assertion that doesn't manifest as a visible constraint on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character is a functional archetype, not an individual. Motivation is explicitly stated ("restore a shared balance") rather than revealed through choice or sacrifice. The tuner's defining trait, "infinitely patient," is an unwavering label that permits the central action but generates no internal conflict, contradiction, or embodied emotional texture, rendering the character a symbolic catalyst rather than a compelling protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on stock phrasing like "steeled herself" and "overwhelming sense of purpose." Emotions at the closure are stated ("felt a deep sense of loss") rather than fully embodied. The internal conflict between duty and loneliness is present but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation—to "thread the labyrinth with his own story"—is clear but remains abstract and is stated repetitively rather than revealed through conflicting choices. His interiority is consistent but lacks contradiction; he is driven by a single, unwavering urge, which limits emotional depth. The connection to his father, the "cry wolf boy," is a compelling premise that remains largely unexplored on the page, functioning more as a label than a force shaping his micro-choices within the prison.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivations are explicitly stated rather than dramatized. The alchemist's journey is passive, as she is simply guided to the solution without facing meaningful struggle or making a difficult choice. The intriguing "lovingly venomous" trait is asserted but never demonstrated, leaving the ghost's internal conflict and complexity unexplored beyond the label of "mournful elation."

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but static and abstract. Her interiority relies heavily on repeating thematic labels like "hauntingly optimistic" and "orchid solace" rather than showing embodied, contradictory emotions. There is no internal conflict; she is a vessel for the theme, proceeding towards her goal without any dramatized struggle, doubt, or meaningful micro-choices under pressure, which flattens her characterization into an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is delivered through summary and emotional labels rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "felt a sense of cautious enchantment growing" tell the reader her state instead of letting them experience it through her perception. The lack of any meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses makes the character arc feel linear and overly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.5)
    Cipher remains a conceptual vessel for the theme rather than a character with agency. The interiority is abstract and declarative ("futuristic nostalgia"), lacking the contradictory impulses or embodied emotions of a lived experience. Motivation is stated ("to discover meaning") but never tested or complicated, resulting in a flat emotional arc without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization itself is thin, serving more as a function of the plot than as a complex individual. The key attribute of "disguis[ing] wisdom as foolishness" is asserted but never demonstrated, leaving a significant gap between the character as described and as shown. While the embroiderer's determination is evident, there is little to no internal conflict or contradictory impulse dramatized on the page, resulting in a flat portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on summary and emotional labels ("felt the weight of," "consumed by regret"). The final change is stated ("she knew that she had been changed") rather than fully dramatized through a difficult micro-choice on the page. While the concept of "fierce tenderness" is compelling, its embodiment in the peak moment is described rather than shown through contradictory action or thought.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but her interiority is compromised by abstract, diagnostic language. Phrases like "graft new meaning onto the old wounds" and "unknot the tangled threads" read like post-hoc analysis rather than an immediate, embodied experience. The character functions more as a vessel for a theme than as a specific, convincing individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s motivation is clear but overly articulated rather than embodied. The story relies on summary ("She had been feeling lost and uninspired") instead of dramatizing the internal conflict through contradictory actions or perceptions in the present scene. While her final choice is consistent, the internal journey to it lacks nuanced, on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motivation to overcome her stifling mastery is clear and her actions are consistent with it. The internal conflict is established, but the emotional resolution feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied. Lines like "her heart swelled with a sense of pride and accomplishment" verge on diagnostic labeling, slightly flattening the moment of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra is more of an archetype than a character. We are told she is a "charming rogue scholar" and "candidly cryptic," but these are labels not demonstrated through contradictory actions or difficult choices. Her motivation is clear but lacks interiority; her defiance is a static trait rather than a struggle we witness. Her actions are competent but lack the specified rogue-like quality or any visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization relies on elegant labels like "shyly unstoppable creator" and "photosynthesize [pain]" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The emotional progression is logical but linear, moving from turmoil to creation to peace without the friction of a deeply embodied internal conflict. The character reads as a beautiful archetype for the story's theme rather than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The caretaker's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is expressed through evocative but somewhat abstract labels like "foxglove regret" rather than through contradictory impulses shown in action. Her emotions are described more than embodied. The characterization serves the story's atmospheric goals well but lacks the deep, earned complexity needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation to restore trust is clear and serves as a solid anchor. However, her interiority is conveyed through abstract labels ("cautious exuberance," "sense of pride") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The story tells us about her complex methods ("interconnected promises") and feelings, but we don't witness them in a way that feels specific or earned, leaving the characterization feeling more like a summary than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelin’s motivation is clear but her interiority is expressed through cliché and emotional labels rather than specific, contradictory impulses. Phrases like "deep sense of connection" and "felt the weight of her task" summarize her state without embodying it. Her emotional progression is a smooth, unconflicted path to resolve, lacking the granular struggle that makes a character’s internal change feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Emilia’s motivation is clear—to find equilibrium amidst a life of secrets. However, the internal conflict between her "need for secrecy and the need for connection" is stated rather than dramatized through on-page choices or interactions. Her emotions are often labeled ("bittersweet sensation," "mix of joy and sorrow") instead of being fully embodied, which borders on diagnostic self-awareness and keeps the reader at a slight distance from her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but their interiority is conveyed through generic emotional labels ("I felt a sense of kinship," "I felt a surge of peace") rather than specific, embodied experience. The emotional progression is linear and lacks the friction of internal conflict. The character reads more as a thoughtful observer than an agent grappling with contradictory impulses, making the final earned peace feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is clearly stated ("luminous respite," "learn the rhythm of belonging") but lacks depth. The astrologer functions more as a lens for the atmosphere than a person with compelling internal conflict; their emotions are labeled ("a shiver," "quiet satisfaction") rather than embodied, and their success feels preordained rather than earned through struggle or a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is more of a title, "sea-foam recollectionist," than a character with demonstrated contradictory impulses. Her motivation is stated clearly but her internal state is conveyed through abstract labels like "cheerful gloom" and "transliterated emotions" rather than embodied action. The final emotional shift from "cheerful gloom" to "a deep sense of connection" is asserted, but the final sentence confusingly claims the gloom will "stay with her forever," undermining the sense of an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is explicitly stated but lacks depth because it is never tested. Elian is presented as a competent artist-philosopher who succeeds without any meaningful struggle or internal conflict. His interiority consists of abstract proclamations ("Elian felt a sense of harmony") rather than embodied, contradictory emotions, making him feel more like a vehicle for a concept than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire scene. The interiority, however, relies on somewhat generic phrasing ("let the tranquility of the surroundings seep into her bones," "lost in thought") and articulates her process with a self-awareness that feels more like authorial summary than embodied experience ("Her dance was a manifestation of this unity"). The change is earned within the story's mystical logic, but the characterization lacks deeper, contradictory impulses, reading more as a vessel for the theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    The characterization relies heavily on abstract labels rather than dramatized traits. Interiority is summarized with phrases like "a seeker of meaning" and "someone who reads between lines," which feels like diagnostic authorial intrusion. Emotional states are similarly declared ("she felt a sense of peace") instead of being embodied, and the repetitive "she felt a sense of..." construction flattens the character's voice into a template.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's characterization relies heavily on summary and stock attributes ("scarred," "world of pain," "fractured soul"). The transformation from pained firefighter to enlightened messenger feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with contradictory impulses. Interiority is presented through diagnostic labels like "translate the pain... into a universal language," which reads more like a thematic thesis statement than a specific, embodied emotional process.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear but highly abstract ("puzzle out new equations for hope"), which keeps her character at a distance. The story relies on labels like "logical dreamer" and diagnostic emotional summaries ("she felt a sense of excitement and wonder") instead of embodying her internal conflict through concrete, contradictory impulses in the scene. Her actions are consistent, but the characterization lacks the specificity and internal friction needed for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.5)
    The cartographer's motivation is clear, but their character is static and underdeveloped. Key traits like "sensitively perceptive" are stated as labels rather than demonstrated through contradictory actions or difficult choices. The emotional arc relies on summary, as in the declaration that a feeling "resonated deeply," which substitutes telling for embodied interiority and flattens the character's journey into a series of predictable reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The painter's motivation is clear but stated repetitively rather than shown through action under pressure. Characterization relies on recurring labels like "perceptively calm demeanor" instead of earned interiority or embodied emotion. She functions more as a vessel for the story's magical concept than a complex individual with discernible internal conflict or meaningful flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elian's motivation is repeatedly stated but never dramatized through a difficult choice. His interiority consists of abstract labels and diagnostic self-awareness ("rugged determination and vulnerability," "operatively gentle") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses in a moment of pressure. The character reads as a vessel for thematic concepts, not a person experiencing them.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character is built on labels ("amoral philanthropist," "secretly sentimental") that are stated but not dramatized through conflicting on-page choices. Her "amorality" is absent from her actions, which appear conventionally heroic. The interiority relies on summary ("pang of sentimentality," "deep sense of satisfaction") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion, making her feel more like an outline than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character’s motivation is clear but her interiority is rendered in abstract, diagnostic labels like "heart heavy with the weight of expectation" and "lullaby of conformity."

The story describes a change instead of dramatizing the specific, granular feelings of a unique individual undergoing it.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Amaranth's motivation is clearly stated but feels abstract and intellectualized. Her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("soothe her frayed nerves," "felt her creative juices stirring") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The connection between "urbane calligrapher" and "subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is asserted, not dramatized, leaving her character feeling more like a collection of interesting concepts than a cohesive individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains one-dimensional. She is more of a symbol for her stated purpose than a person with contradictory impulses.

    Akira's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on summary and labels rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Phrases like "She was technically gentle" and her pre-packaged backstory of self-forgiveness are told, not shown.

    Hindsight's motivation is explicitly stated but the character remains a conceptual vessel. Interiority is described with abstract labels like "weighed heavily" and "ethereal grit" rather than shown through embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The character serves the theme but lacks the particularity or internal friction of a fully realized individual; there is no dramatized flaw or micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    The astronomer's characterization relies heavily on labels like "frugal" and "empirically ironic," which are stated but not dramatized through meaningful choices or internal contradictions. The motivation is clear but grandly abstract. The final transformation, where their ironic nature is "subsumed by a sense of unity," reads as a convenient, unearned epiphany rather than a change earned through on-page struggle with their supposed skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's characterization is abstract and lacks on-page struggle. Her motivation is stated clearly but her defining trait, "scheming pacifist," is not dramatized; her actions read as a direct, unopposed magical display rather than a clever scheme. The interiority relies on philosophical labels ("shifting grace," "cycle of suffering") instead of embodied emotion or contradictory impulses, making her feel more like a thematic vessel than a flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    The mirror maker’s motivation is clear but presented more as a static label ("to capture a runaway dream") than a deeply felt, contradictory internal state. Her interiority is summarized with stock phrases like "eyes lit up" and "heart swelled," which lack specific, embodied texture. The core conflict between being "firmly grounded" and wanting to merge with a dream is a good premise, but it's resolved linearly rather than dramatized as a simultaneous, churning internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority feels overly articulate and thematic. She thinks in the exact terms the story wants to convey ("an act she believed would help bridge the generational wisdom"), which flattens her into a vehicle for the theme rather than a complex individual. The "endearingly feisty spirit" is mentioned but not meaningfully dramatized in a way that affects her choices or carries a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The curator's motivation hinges on a generic "curiosity" and their internal state is conveyed through repeated labels like "disquiet." The pivotal philosophical breakthrough feels bestowed rather than earned through internal struggle, making the character more of a passive vessel for the story's concept than an active agent whose change feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her climactic change of heart is an unearned epiphany, stated rather than dramatized. Her interiority relies on stock phrases ("heart swelled with excitement") and diagnostic self-awareness ("The experience had given her a new sense of purpose"), which flattens the character into a vessel for the theme instead of a person undergoing a credible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("chimera twin discoverer," "blissfully aberrant") rather than dramatized traits. Lyra's interiority is frequently summarized with phrases like "felt a thrill" or "felt a shiver," and her internal conflict is stated ("lost in the labyrinthine corridors of her own mind") rather than embodied in specific, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character motivation is repeatedly stated using diagnostic labels ("desire to translate confusion into clarity") rather than dramatized through choice and consequence. Both Emilia and the professor are functional archetypes who align immediately and work without friction or internal conflict. The character change is a sudden, unearned "jolt of insight" rather than a struggled-for transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains flat. She functions as a competent and single-minded agent to solve the plot's problem without any embodied struggle, internal contradiction, or flaw that complicates her choices, making the final satisfaction feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.5)
    The custodian is a functional vessel for the plot, not a compelling character. Motivation is declared ("to prove that coincidences have meaning") rather than dramatized, and the emotional journey relies on telling ("felt a surge of determination," "felt their heart lift") instead of embodied action. The absence of any internal conflict, struggle, or meaningful choice against resistance makes the final sense of purpose feel unearned and the characterization flat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies more on declarative statements about her purpose ("to sculpt her identity," "preserving the past") than on embodied, contradictory impulses. The emotional progression from feeling a "weight" to "peace" is legible but feels somewhat linear and frictionless. The story tells us she is shaped by experience rather than dramatizing a difficult internal negotiation with the memories she absorbs.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("hopelessness," "renewed energy," "serious playfulness") rather than embodied, contradictory experience. The emotional arc is a smooth, linear progression from a negative state to a positive one, lacking the friction of a genuinely difficult internal struggle. Her defining actions are observing and walking, which keeps her largely passive until the external discovery of the note resolves her conflict for her.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.5)
    The chronicler serves as a vessel for the story's concept rather than a compelling character in her own right. Her motivation is stated abstractly ("discover the texture of time") but isn't tested or complicated by any internal contradiction or external pressure. Characterization relies on labels like "warmly observant" without dramatizing the trait through a costly choice, resulting in a flat, passive protagonist whose interiority reads more like a philosophical essay.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eli's motivation is clear, but the internal conflict and its resolution are more summarized than dramatized. The shift from dread to peace feels unearned because the interiority relies on abstract labels like "their perception of the world expanded" instead of embodied, contradictory feelings in the moment. The character reads as a vessel for the story's concept rather than a fully realized individual grappling with a visceral fear.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.0)
    The character's motivation is clear but entirely abstract and lacks any dramatized internal conflict or contradiction. The gondola operator functions more as a serene archetype or a symbol for the story's theme rather than a person with discernible flaws or struggles. Her competence is absolute, and her interiority is stated ("fluidly logical mind") rather than embodied, resulting in a flat characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clear, but her characterization lacks depth. Interiority is conveyed through stock phrases like "steeled herself" and "heart quickened," which label emotions rather than embodying them in a particular way. There is no significant internal conflict; her journey is one of competence and determination without any visible flaws, contradictory impulses, or moments of genuine struggle that might complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    The keeper’s motivation is abstract and awkwardly phrased. The line "to teach suffocating to breathe" reads as a diagnostic label rather than an embodied goal, and its repetition at the end feels unearned. While the keeper's tenderness is mentioned, their actions are driven by external necessity rather than an internal conflict between tenderness and calculation, leaving the characterization feeling more asserted than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.3)
    Lyra's characterization is superficial. Her defining trait as a "pyramid scheme survivor" is stated but never meaningfully dramatized in her choices or perspective. Her internal state relies on generic labels like "felt a sudden surge of curiosity" rather than embodied emotion, and her repeated "virtuously mischievous grin" is an unearned character note, a label without an action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    The character is a passive vessel, defined by a role ("dynasty ender") rather than interiority. Motivation is stated but not grounded in any personal history or internal conflict, making the final epiphany feel unearned. The characterization relies on labels like "eloquently silent" without dramatizing how such traits create constraints or reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.5)
    The knight's transformation from "withdrawn" to "purposeful" is clear but feels more asserted than earned. Interiority relies on labels like "shivering bliss" and summaries ("withdrawn nature began to dissipate") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The motivation springs from an "inexplicable connection," which feels convenient and slightly undermines the agency of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s motivation is clear but her interiority relies on stock phrasing and emotional summary. The transition from "broken-hearted" to purposeful feels more like a declared arc than an embodied struggle. Her emotions are labeled ("heart swelled with a mix of sadness and curiosity") rather than shown through specific, contradictory actions or perceptions. The story asserts her change rather than earning it through difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear but entirely abstract and presented without internal conflict. Her characterization relies on telling ("underestimated rebel," "carefully resourceful") rather than showing through difficult choices. The interiority is generic, using labels like "turmoil brewing within her" without specific embodiment, making her a flat archetype for the theme rather than a compelling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The saxophonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains somewhat abstract. Phrases like "quietly vivid intensity" label an emotional state rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory internal details. While her actions align with her goal, her interiority lacks the particularity and internal conflict needed to elevate her from a well-executed archetype to a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for wonder rather than a character with discernible conflict or flaws. Her transformation is repeatedly stated ("emerges transformed") but not earned or embodied; it's a label applied to a flat archetype. The interiority relies on stock phrases like "heart filled with a sense of wonder," failing to render a specific, contradictory internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian’s motivation shifts from repairing the past (clocks) to navigating the future (compass), but this change is delivered through summary and epiphanic statements rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. The character’s interiority relies on stock phrases like "felt a sense of calm wash over him." The arc is conceptually sound, but the execution lacks the specific, contradictory impulses of a character genuinely under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to find a new purpose is clear, but her interiority is expressed through abstract labels like "luminous regret" and "kintsugi intentions" rather than embodied emotion. The character's change is asserted as an intellectual epiphany instead of being dramatized through a difficult choice or contradictory impulse felt in the moment. She remains a vessel for the story's theme rather than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    The collector is more of a functionary than a character. Her motivation ("to integrate laughter into healing") is stated very late and feels disconnected from the solemn, laughter-free scene on the page. Interiority relies on labels like "pang of curiosity" and "sense of satisfaction" instead of embodied emotion, making her feel distant and undefined.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the interiority relies on abstract, unearned philosophical jargon ("mathematics of mercy," "displaced rooted-ness") rather than specific, embodied emotion. The pivotal moment of understanding is summarized with label-speak ("she finally grasped the truth"), which reads as an authorial assertion rather than an earned character epiphany. Arin is a functional but one-dimensional supportive figure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s motivation is clear by the end, but its arrival is summarized ("motivation, long buried, began to resurface") rather than dramatized. The interiority relies on telling emotions with stock phrases like "felt an inexplicable jolt" and "felt a shiver run down her spine," which keeps the character at a distance and lacks specific, embodied feeling. While the final change in purpose is significant, the path to it feels more like a smooth intellectual exercise than a genuine internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ezra's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her stated desire to uncover hidden stories. The concept of the "weightless burden" provides a solid emotional anchor for her arc. However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary ("her skillfully observant nature") rather than fully embodied perception, and the story lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or a choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.5)
    The operator is a cryptic archetype, a functional requirement of the plot rather than a character. Motivation is delivered externally via the whisper, and the subsequent actions are executed without internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses. While the "quiet reverence" establishes a consistent persona, the absence of any meaningful micro-choices or visible struggle under pressure renders the characterization flat and the success feel preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, but her transformation is more asserted than dramatized. The concluding realization, "it was not just a civilization that she reimagined, but herself," is stated twice, functioning as a summary rather than an earned, embodied shift. Her internal conflict between revolutionary and archaeologist is a static premise, not an active, contradictory force within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Erebus is a consistent archetype, and his motivation to "restore balance" is clear. However, he lacks any internal conflict or contradictory impulses; he is a vessel for the theme rather than a complex individual. His reverence and precision are well-established, but his perfect competence and unwavering purpose flatten the characterization, making him feel more like a function of the plot than a person navigating it.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, and the interiority relies on stock phrases ("shiver run down her spine") and declarative summaries ("Her motivation, she realized..."). She functions more as a passive sensorium for the atmosphere than a character with tangible internal conflict, reading as a vessel for the theme rather than an individual.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    The character reads as a vessel for the story's theme rather than a person with discernible flaws or internal contradictions. Her interiority is composed of abstract, diagnostic labels ("Her goal was to scaffold complexity with simplicity") that feel imposed and unearned. Motivation is present but low-stakes, and the complete absence of struggle or a meaningful choice foreclosed by the ending makes her arc feel flat and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.5)
    Luna's motivation is established but her characterization is static and her internal change is summarized rather than dramatized. The story tells us her art and personality shifted from "vibrant" to "softer," but we don't witness any internal conflict, choice, or cost associated with this transformation. The epiphany feels unearned, a gentle slide into understanding rather than a struggle, which limits character depth and fails to show contradictory impulses acting in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    Naomi’s motivation to find "truth" is clear but abstract, and her core identity as a "civil-rights archivist" feels like an unactivated label. Her interiority is conveyed through summary and cliché ("felt a spark of understanding," "inexplicable connection") rather than through embodied, contradictory emotions. The pivotal decision to initiate a "parley" happens, but the character's internal calculus leading to it lacks specificity, making her feel more like a vehicle for the plot than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear but remains abstract, a vessel for the story's theme rather than a complex individual. Interiority relies on labels like "fierce intensity" and "fierce determination" instead of embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The stated rejection of "false comfort" is a promising start for internal conflict, but it's a told trait that rationalizes a single choice rather than creating ongoing tension in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.5)
    The scribe's motivation is clearly stated but their interiority remains generic. Key moments of change feel passive, as when their "hands moved with a life of their own," reducing character agency. Emotions like "trepidation" and "wonder" are labeled rather than embodied, making the scribe feel more like a vessel for the concept than a distinct individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character's core trait, "furiously tranquil," is an intriguing paradox stated but not dramatized; we see tranquility without the furious internal conflict. Her motivation is abstract and her interiority is described with generic labels like "overwhelming sense of purpose" rather than concrete, character-specific thought. The final acceptance of her role feels more like a passive reception of fate than a choice forged from visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ember's motivation is clear but stated more than embodied. The shift from a serious, diligent tester to a bell-ringing mystic feels more like a "sudden urge" than a choice compelled by escalating internal conflict. Her curiosity is labeled "credibly curious," an awkward phrase that feels like an external assertion rather than a trait demonstrated through costly choices. The final state of peace is achieved, but the journey lacks sufficient internal friction to make it deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.5)
    The janitor's motivation is clear but stated abstractly rather than dramatized. The interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels like "flourishing stillness" and "primal elegance," making the character feel more like a vessel for a theme than a specific individual with contradictory impulses. A single micro-choice (moving the glass) is present, but it's not enough to overcome the lack of embodied emotion and internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    The recluse's motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies on summary and stock emotional phrasing ("a jumble of conflicting emotions," "deep and abiding sorrow") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The character functions more as a vessel for the theme than a complex individual whose flaws complicate choices. The emotional progression is linear and lacks the specificity needed for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    The timekeeper is defined more by their role and task than by a particular interiority. Motivation is clear but lacks internal conflict or contradiction; the emotional progression is a linear path from confusion to understanding. Emotions are often labeled ("excitement was palpable") rather than embodied, making the final shift feel more asserted than earned through a difficult, character-revealing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The poet’s motivation is clear but her interiority relies on stock phrasing and unearned epiphanies, such as feeling "connected to the very fabric of existence." This diagnostic self-awareness and emotional summary flatten the character, making her more of a vessel for the theme than a specific individual. Her emotional progression is too smooth, lacking the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)
    The caretaker’s motivation is clear, but the characterization is flat and asserted rather than dramatized. Key traits like "brazen calm" and "gently systematic" are repeatedly labeled but never tested by on-page events or internal conflict. The character reads as an archetype of a wise, dying artisan, lacking the contradictory impulses or specific interiority that would make them feel like an individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character is defined by labels ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious") rather than through contradictory actions or specific, embodied interiority. Emotions are similarly declared with stock phrases ("mix of curiosity and doubt," "mix of excitement and trepidation") instead of being dramatized. The character reads more as a vessel for the story's concepts than a person with a particular, flawed worldview under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    The coachman is a compelling archetype, but lacks the interior contradiction or specific, embodied emotion required for top-tier characterization. His motivation is clear but his internal state is summarized with stock phrases like "his heart was filled with a sense of peace." The character reads as a vessel for the theme rather than a complex individual whose flaws or limits complicate his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and stated emotions rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "Lyra felt an surge of motivation" and "Kael felt a deep sense of belonging" are labels that substitute for dramatized interiority. While the bond between Lyra and Kael is clear, it isn't tested in a crucible; their relationship is static. Kael's backstory as a body-finder adds texture but doesn't seem to inform his on-page choices in a meaningful way beyond general sniffing ability.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clearly stated but her internal shift from confusion to determination feels more declared than embodied. The transition is triggered by an external, magical event (the glowing compass) rather than a difficult internal choice, making the character arc feel passive and somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    Moonwhisper is more of a functional archetype than a character. Motivation is clear (save the world), but interiority is generic, relying on stock phrases like "steeled themselves" and "a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over them." Key traits like "chivalrous thief" and "sacredly playful" are asserted as labels but not meaningfully dramatized through choices; the "thief" aspect feels particularly vestigial as the character acts with full authority. There is no internal conflict or difficult trade-off, rendering the character a passive vessel for the plot's success.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.5)
    The characters function as allegorical archetypes rather than individuals with concrete interiority. The crisis survivor's internal shift is legible but earned through symbolic progression, not psychological depth. The crisis actor's defining trait, "benevolently ruthless," is stated but never demonstrated, remaining a label without impact on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The seer’s motivation ("to understand the shape of home") is established but remains abstract. While the "pang of sorrow" provides a brief moment of embodied emotion that triggers the climax, the character largely functions as a vessel for the story's mystical concepts rather than a figure with palpable internal contradictions acting in the scene. Her competence is stated, but her choices feel preordained by the vision rather than emerging from a difficult, character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    The tutor's motivation is exceptionally clear, but the execution of his internal change lacks specificity. His guilt is established, but his journey toward forgiveness inside the labyrinth is summarized ("a journey into the depths of his own regret and sorrow") rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The final peace feels more declared than earned, reading like an emotional summary rather than the result of a specific, grueling internal battle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.5)
    The artist’s motivation is clear but her interiority remains abstract and declarative. She serves more as a vessel for the theme than a complex character with embodied, contradictory impulses. The final shift to understanding feels more like an asserted epiphany ("she knew that...") than a choice earned through dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelin’s motivation is clear but stated rather than demonstrated through complex choice. Her interiority relies on generic phrasing like "born of desperation" and labels such as "uncertain alchemist" that are not fully embodied in her precise actions. The mentor's influence is a strong anchor, but the character's final change is a tidy emotional shift to "peace" that feels more asserted than earned through a difficult internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    The painter's motivation to capture beauty is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on abstract labels like "intimately aloof" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her interiority is summarized with thematic concepts ("temporary eternity") instead of being shown through specific, embodied perception. The backstory of the "cracked mirror" provides a motive but feels more like a convenient explanation than a lived-in trauma that shapes her present-moment choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is clearly stated but lacks dramatized internal conflict. His interiority relies on abstract labels and summaries of emotion ("felt a surge of determination," "felt a sense of peace") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The character arc is a smooth, unconflicted progression from belief to confirmation, which lessens the impact of his final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    The navigator’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies too heavily on abstract labels ("raw solace," "sense of purpose," "sense of acceptance") rather than embodied, contradictory emotions. While the arc from grief to acceptance is earned by the physical journey, the character's internal state is often summarized. The "patchwork" nature is a strong concept but is stated more than it complicates her choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("rational," "involuntarily truthful") rather than dramatized choices. Interiority is summarized using diagnostic language like "cultivating psychological safety" and "confront the trauma," which flattens the character's experience into a case study. The central trait of "involuntary truthfulness" is never tested in a scene, remaining an inert piece of backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s motivation as an observer is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on summary and intellectual labels ("Kael realized," "Kael understood"). The emotional weight of the ending is asserted ("he felt the weight of the memories, a cumulative burden") rather than fully embodied, reading more like a thematic statement than a lived experience. His defining trait of eccentricity is stated but not demonstrated in his choices or perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    Emilia's motivation is clearly stated (the promise), but her interiority is summarized rather than embodied. Key actions are driven by "whimsy" instead of the asserted "empirically intuitive nature," weakening her agency. The emotional resolution relies on clichés ("Tears of joy and sadness mingled") and declarative statements of feeling ("heart swelled"), preventing a deeper, more earned character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    The queen's motivation is clear but her characterization relies heavily on summary and labeled emotions ("felt a sense of purpose," "felt a sense of trepidation"). Her core trait of "disenchanted" is stated but not embodied in her choices, and the shift to purpose feels abrupt. Her companion is a stock character who serves only to receive the queen's single line of dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    The alchemist's characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("scientist, but also a romantic," "scientifically romantic intensity") rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her motivation is clear but her internal state is described with conceptual jargon ("palette of resolve," "directed spontaneity") that feels more like an authorial thesis than character-particular interiority. The final change is an asserted epiphany, lacking the texture of a struggle or a choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the execution relies on abstract labels ("chronologically confused," "feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied emotion. Interiority feels more like a philosophical summary than a lived experience, with diagnostic self-awareness replacing the messiness of genuine internal conflict. The central change from confusion to clarity is asserted more than it is earned through concrete, contradictory impulses shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's character is a coherent concept, but her interiority is expressed through abstract, diagnostic labels ("map emotional terrain," "humanize the mundane") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The story tells us she has honed a skill rather than showing her struggle to apply it under pressure. Her journey feels less like a character arc and more like a philosophical summary, with a pre-packaged epiphany that lacks the messiness of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaito's motivation is clear—transforming scars into stories—but his interiority relies on summary and stock phrasing. Lines like "felt an inexplicable affinity" and "felt an overwhelming urge" tell us his state rather than embodying it. The transformation from burdened to serene is asserted as a result of the magical writing process, but the preceding internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses needed to make the release feel deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra's motivation to atone is clear, but her characterization feels somewhat abstract. Her profession as a "gossip-column exorcist" is a fascinating, high-concept label that remains disconnected from her on-page actions and internal monologue, which lean into a more generic mystical practitioner archetype. Her interiority tends to summarize her beliefs rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but her characterization is entirely abstract. Interiority is summarized with phrases like "delving deep into the recesses of her own soul" rather than embodied. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she is a flawless vessel for the plot, which makes her feel less like a person and more like a function of the story's concept.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.5)
    The shepherd's motivation is clear but one-dimensional, serving as a vessel for the story's theme rather than a character with internal contradictions. Interiority is described with abstract labels ("thoughts grew more introspective") instead of being embodied in specific, character-particular perceptions. The final "epiphany" feels unearned, as it arises from a summarized process rather than a dramatized struggle with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.5)
    The characterization of Lena is a collection of labels rather than a dramatized personality. Her profession, "intrusion detection specialist," and her "spatially gifted" attribute are stated but have no bearing on her choices or the story's outcome. Her interiority consists of over-articulated, abstract concepts like "the physics of letting go," lacking the concrete, contradictory impulses of a lived-in mind. There is no discernible internal conflict; she moves smoothly from contemplation to epiphany without struggle, making her less a character and more a vehicle for the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her interiority reads as overly analytical and diagnostic. Phrases like "a complex interplay of factors" and her contemplation of "lucid contradictions" feel more like an academic abstract than an embodied emotional state. The character's shift to resolve is intellectually coherent but lacks the visceral, contradictory impulses expected under such personal stress; it's a conclusion reached, not a struggle endured.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.5)
    The operator's motivation is clear but remains largely conceptual and is stated rather than dramatized through on-page choices under pressure. There is no significant internal conflict; the character exists in a state of placid purposefulness from beginning to end. While consistent, this lacks the depth of a character with contradictory impulses, resulting in a flat emotional progression without a sense of earned change or costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.5)
    The archivist is a static archetype, defined by labels ("walnut-ink," "gently thorough") rather than choices under pressure. Her interiority consists of declared emotions ("felt a pang of melancholy," "felt a sense of haunted euphoria") instead of embodied, contradictory impulses. Motivation is stated but never tested, making her commitment to preserving moments feel like a professional summary rather than a deeply held value forged in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Raven's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization relies on telling over showing. Interiority is often summarized with diagnostic labels like "deep-seated pain" and the repeated attribute "desperately jocular," which feel more like authorial assertions than embodied emotions experienced under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies on abstract labels like "a labyrinth of sorrow and loss" rather than dramatizing the conflict through embodied emotion or contradictory impulses in the present moment. The final epiphany feels more declared than earned, as the preceding struggle is summarized. The character's unique abilities are stated but don't consistently shape their specific micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clearly stated ("to thresh meaning from experience") but lacks embodied emotion or internal conflict. Her journey is described through diagnostic labels like "confidently uncertain" rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The character reads as a functional vessel for the story's concept, with an overly tidy and rational emotional progression that abstracts her state instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.5)
    The advisor and the old man are effective archetypes for this fable-like narrative, but they lack specific, contradictory interiority. The advisor's motivation is stated directly ("they sought to translate silence into music") rather than revealed through choices under pressure. While their actions are consistent, the characters serve the concept more than they feel like individuals with complex inner lives, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization is built on labels rather than demonstrated action. Elian is a "lending library arsonist," but this trait has no bearing on their choices within the archive. Similarly, their "analytically intuitive mind" is stated, but their process reads as purely emotional inspiration. The climactic feeling of "volcanic tenderness" is asserted, not embodied, representing a recurring issue of telling over showing interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is stated rather than dramatized, and her interiority relies heavily on abstract, high-concept labels like "auroral sorrow" and "collective unconscious." Aria feels more like a vessel for the story's themes than an individual with a specific, embodied emotional life. The crucial feeling of "auroral sorrow" is named but not earned through concrete sensory experience, reading as diagnostic self-awareness in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated ("to prove a point") but remains an abstract intellectual exercise rather than a deeply felt need. Her interiority relies on stock phrases like "heart beating with anticipation," and her key trait of identifying walks is asserted but not used to influence a choice. Character actions feel more like a sequence of discoveries than a series of meaningful decisions driven by consistent, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization remains archetypal and flat, which is a viable stylistic choice. However, motivation is delivered via a direct, unearned authorial statement ("driven by a desire to teach darkness the value of stars") instead of being dramatized through choice or action. Key emotional states like "spiralingly calm" are also labeled rather than embodied, leaving the characters as passive vessels for the mood piece rather than agents with discernible interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elian's character is a vessel for the theme rather than a person. His motivation ("plant forests of second thoughts") is abstract and his journey is frictionless, lacking the internal conflict or contradictory impulses that create depth. Phrases like "amplified quiet determination" are labels that substitute for dramatized struggle, making his ultimate success feel preordained and emotionally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on evocative labels ("gentle strength," "combative tenderness") than on dramatized, contradictory actions. The internal transformation feels more asserted than earned, particularly the climactic epiphany which is summarized rather than experienced through a concrete struggle. Her core traits are stated effectively but aren't sufficiently tested by on-page choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character of Echo is a consistent but thin vessel for the story's themes. Motivation and internal conflict are stated directly ("cultivating lightness in grief," "moral ambiguity") rather than dramatized through contradictory choices or actions. The characterization relies on summary and labels, preventing a sense of embodied, particular interiority from developing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies more on abstract labels ("turmoil within her own creative soul") than on the dramatization of specific, contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.5)
    The characters serve more as archetypes for the theme than as individuals with compelling interiority. The painter's motivation is explicitly stated ("to find beauty in the imperfect") rather than revealed through struggle. The glassblower's transformation is asserted ("She, too, began to see the world through his eyes") but feels too sudden and lacks the dramatized internal conflict that would make it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    The character is a passive observer whose motivation is stated but never tested. Interiority consists of abstract labels like "curiosity" and "deep sense of connection" rather than embodied, contradictory emotions. The bell ringer is more of a vessel for the story's theme than a character with agency or internal conflict, resulting in a flat and unmemorable presence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character’s motivation is clear but overly articulated, bordering on a thesis statement ("motivation was to teach withering to bloom again"). The internal journey from grief to hope is legible but proceeds with a tidy linearity that lacks the contradictory impulses of genuine emotional struggle. While the change is shown through action (crafting the brooch), the interiority relies on stock phrasing like "turmoil within" and "dark recesses of their soul," which keeps the character at an emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    The cartomancer's motivation is clear but one-dimensional, driven by a "steadily curious" nature that is repeatedly labeled rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Interiority is abstract, relying on summarized states like "sense of purpose" instead of embodied emotion. The character acts as a consistent vessel for the story's concept but lacks the internal contradiction or tangible struggle expected for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The historian's motivation is clear but her characterization relies heavily on labels like "steadily unpredictable curiosity" rather than dramatized choices. Her emotional state is repeatedly summarized with the diagnostic phrase "anguished joy," which abstracts her experience rather than embodying it in a character-particular way. The colleague is a functional but flat plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dusk noticer's motivation is clear but abstract, centered on "preserving the shape of hope." Her interiority is conveyed through labels like "luminous regret" rather than fully embodied emotion or internal contradiction. While her actions are consistent with her role, she functions more as a thoughtful observer and thematic vessel than a character with deep, conflicting impulses tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena’s motivation to find a new purpose is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic language (e.g., "shedding layers of assumption and expectation," "reconstruct her understanding"). The internal conflict is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The emotional progression feels more like a summarized therapeutic process than a visceral, earned change, lacking the texture of a character-particular crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character is defined by intriguing labels like "closure seeker with a penchant for opening wounds," but these contradictions are never dramatized. Motivation is abstract ("read the stories in scars") and interiority relies on stock phrases like "a maelstrom of images and emotions," making Elian feel more like a vessel for the story's concepts than a realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on telling over showing, with motivation stated as a generic mission ("uncover the secrets") and emotions described with abstract labels ("inexplicable pull," "felt the weight...lifting"). The protagonist is a passive recipient of a vision rather than an agent making choices under pressure. The final transformation is asserted ("energy now a part of their own being") without being earned through a difficult, on-page choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dreamer's motivation is clear but delivered as a summary ("trapped by the doubts and fears") rather than shown through embodied internal conflict. Her interiority relies on stock emotional phrasing ("heart beat faster"), and she functions more as an archetype for the story's theme than a character with particularized flaws or contradictory impulses acting in the scene. The final change feels asserted rather than earned through a difficult, on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Asa's motivation is clear but her interiority is more stated than embodied. She is a competent actor, but the story lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or a micro-choice that reveals a deeper hierarchy of values. The "dreamless" trait is a compelling label that is never paid off, leaving her characterization feeling functional rather than deeply specific.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.5)
    The philosopher is a passive vessel for the story's concepts rather than a character with tangible agency or internal contradiction. His motivation is stated repeatedly but never tested or embodied through a difficult choice. Emotions are labeled ("felt at home," "felt no fear") instead of being rendered through specific, contradictory internal experiences, making him read as a stock figure in a conceptual landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    The characters are archetypes rather than individuals. Eira is a functional "wise guide" and the travelers are a monolithic "they." Motivation is clear but interiority is summarized through labels ("felt a sense of resolve," "felt the weight of their quest") instead of being embodied through specific, contradictory impulses or choices, making the emotional progression feel overly smooth and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    The bellhop's internal conflict is clear but articulated with too much diagnostic self-awareness. Phrases like "the weight of their own unpardonable silence" and the neat epiphany, "they came to see that it was not just a price paid, but a choice made," read as emotional summary rather than embodied, contradictory experience. The character's journey from doubt to acceptance feels more like a philosophical argument than a visceral, earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael is more of an archetype than a character, defined by labels like "regally unpretentious" and "quiet confidence" rather than embodied choices. The motivation is clear, but interiority is summarized with stock phrases like "heart beat with a quiet excitement," which tells the emotion instead of dramatizing it. The pretender is a narrative function with no characterization, making the final confrontation feel hollow as it's a victory over a cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from data analysis to map-making. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into abstract labels ("periodically eternal") rather than embodied emotion, and her final shift from analytical to intuitive feels more asserted than earned through a visible internal struggle. The character is functional and sympathetic, but lacks the deep, contradictory impulses needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies on summarizing labels like "renewed sense of purpose" at key moments. The core trait of being "awkwardly confident" is asserted rather than tested in a way that complicates a choice, limiting the depth of characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's core identity—"feisty insurgent grandmother"—remains a label rather than a demonstrated reality shaping her choices. Her interiority relies on abstract declarations and stock phrases ("stirred something deep within her") instead of specific, embodied emotion. The motivation is clear, but there is no internal conflict or contradiction; she proceeds on a smooth, rational path to her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.5)
    Amira’s motivation is clear, but her interiority suffers from diagnostic label-speak. Phrases like "somatic markers" and "anchor optimism in realism" read as authorial summary rather than authentic, in-the-moment thought, making the emotional progression feel overly tidy and intellectualized. While her pain is established, the internal conflict lacks the contradictory, messy embodiment of trauma, resolving into a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.5)
    The artist’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies more on abstract labels ("fractured and disjointed," "crestfallen state") than embodied emotion. The transformation from despair to purpose feels more declared than earned through dramatized struggle. While the internal conflict is present, it's articulated with a diagnostic self-awareness that softens the sense of genuine crisis, reading like a summary of a psychological journey rather than the journey itself.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael’s core motivation to understand time dilation is a compelling premise, but the execution remains abstract. The "serene anger" is an interesting but un-dramatized label that dissolves into peace without a visible struggle or choice. The final shift to a "newfound appreciation" reads as an unearned epiphany, told to the reader rather than shown through a costly internal process.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but her core conflict is more labeled than dramatized. The transition from a "bravely conflicted heart" to one "at peace" is asserted in summary rather than earned through a visible internal struggle on the page. Key emotional beats rely on stock phrases, which keeps the characterization functional but prevents it from achieving genuine depth or particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clear, but her character is presented in a static state of resolution. The central conflict between her pacifism and her father's legacy is resolved before the story begins, making this more of a portrait than a crucible. The story lacks a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in-scene; instead, it describes a settled choice, which limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    The fisher's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her characterization remains surface-level. As a "cool-headed" protagonist, she lacks compelling internal conflict; her journey is one of competent execution rather than struggle. Interiority is often stated with labels like "excitement and reverence" rather than embodied, making her more of a vessel for the story's lyrical concepts than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    Adelaide's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, repeated labels like "orbits of regret" rather than concrete, embodied emotion. The decision to employ "proof by contradiction" feels like an intellectual gloss, lacking the grit of a character-particular choice made under pressure. While her arc from worry to resolve is legible, it feels more summarized than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.5)
    The tattooist's motivation—her old guilt—is clear, but her interiority feels assembled from a list of intriguing traits rather than a cohesive, embodied struggle. The connection between her guilt and her ability to translate baby cries is asserted ("To hush this inner turmoil, she had developed a unique attribute..."), not dramatized. While her actions respond to pressure, the internal conflict lacks the moment-to-moment contradiction expected in top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character’s motivation is clear, but her interiority is conveyed through abstract, diagnostic labels like "the unlearning" and "turmoil" rather than embodied emotion. She reads more as a symbol for a psychological process than a specific individual. The final emotional shift is asserted ("felt a sense of peace") rather than fully dramatized through a contradictory, difficult internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but her characterization remains a vessel for the story's theme. The interiority relies on abstract labels and diagnostic self-awareness ("aberrant mercy," "gentle radical") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The progression from observation to action is linear and lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict, making the final resolve feel more like a philosophical conclusion than an earned character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    Echo’s motivation is clear—to find peace by reordering her past—but her interiority is delivered through summary rather than embodied experience. The story relies heavily on declarative statements of feeling (e.g., "Echo felt a surge of memories," "Echo felt a sense of rising excitement"), which keeps the character at an emotional distance. While her actions are consistent with her goal, the lack of internal contradiction or specific, character-particular perception beyond labels makes her feel more like a vessel for the plot than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Luna’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on labels ("artist and a scientist," "affectionate skepticism") than on dramatized choices. Her interiority is dense but occasionally veers into self-analysis, such as when the narration defines "somatic markers" for the reader. The central process is more of a guided meditation than a struggle between contradictory impulses, which flattens the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth due to an absence of internal conflict. Emotions are frequently labeled ("felt a deep connection," "felt a sense of contentment") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The story affirms her pre-existing competence and desire without testing them, resulting in a flat arc where the final state of contentment feels more declared than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The hourglass turner is more of an archetype than a character with individualizing traits. Motivation is established ("to spin a prophecy into raw possibility") but remains an abstract label, never tested by a difficult choice or contradictory impulse. Interiority consists of statements of passion rather than embodied emotion or a tangible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    The spy’s motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels like “a sense of peace” and “a sense of hope,” which reads as emotional summary rather than embodied experience. The central change—reintegrating her "other self"—feels more like a sudden, unearned epiphany than a choice earned through struggle. While the trait "prudently daring" is stated, the on-page actions lack a clear trade-off between prudence and daring, reducing it to a label.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The coachman’s motivation, “to distill complexity into essence,” is clearly stated but remains an abstract intellectual concept rather than a felt, embodied struggle. His interiority is rich with poetic language but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses of a character under pressure; it reads more like a philosophical treatise. The young woman functions as a symbolic catalyst rather than a character, her arrival resolving the coachman’s internal state without any meaningful interaction or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    Akira’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on labels like "zen-minded" and "phototropic to kindness" rather than contradictory impulses shown in scene. Her interiority often slips into abstract, authorial summary ("grasp the intricate dance between time and place") instead of a particular, embodied experience. The final decision to take the glass is earned by the epiphany, but the character herself feels more like a vessel for the theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gardener's motivation is clear and evolves, but the characterization relies on labels like "wistfully pragmatic" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene. Key emotions are stated ("felt a sense of peace") rather than embodied through specific, character-particular perception, which keeps the interiority from feeling fully immersive. The shift in purpose is compelling, but the character feels more like a vessel for the story's mood than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra's motivation is clear but her interiority is more stated than embodied. Concepts like "brittle awakenings" are articulated with a diagnostic self-awareness that flattens the emotional experience. The character's internal conflict is described as a consistent state rather than a dynamic process of contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lena's motivation is clear, but her internal state is often summarized with labels rather than embodied. Phrases like "stirred something deep within her" and the self-diagnostic "prismatic quiet" lack specificity. The final epiphany feels more like an intellectual conclusion than a deeply earned emotional shift born from dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lyra's motivation is explicitly stated but remains one-dimensional. There is no internal conflict; her "cautiously hopeful" trait is a label that is simply vindicated without being tested. Her emotional journey is summarized with stock phrases ("felt a shiver," "surge of excitement," "sense of pride") rather than embodied, making the character feel like a vehicle for the plot rather than a person experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra's characterization relies heavily on labels rather than dramatized choices. Her "claustrophobia" is stated but only becomes relevant when it is conveniently resolved by the climax, feeling unearned. Similarly, her "prudently adventurous spirit" is told to us in the final paragraphs as a thematic summary, not shown as a genuine internal conflict that forces a difficult trade-off during the exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character motivation is overtly stated rather than dramatized. The artist's epiphany arrives as a diagnostic label ("a desire to lance the boil of her own emotional numbness"), a critical flaw that replaces embodied experience with summary. The kinship between the characters is asserted ("felt a sense of kinship") but not earned through specific, contradictory, or subtle interactions, leaving them as thematic vessels rather than complex individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s characterization relies heavily on repeated labels like "idealistic" and the oxymoronic "nervously confident" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her motivation to honor her ancestor is a clear starting point but feels static. The shift in stakes to her own identity is declared rather than earned through a specific, costly choice, making her internal state feel more summarized than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.5)
    The fiddler's motivation is clear but their interiority is expressed through abstract, declarative statements ("ashes of 'never' being reshaped into possibility") rather than concrete, embodied emotion. The character functions more as an archetype for the theme of artistic redemption than as a specific, flawed individual. While the arc is present, it lacks the texture of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear, but his character arc from "disillusionment" to "peace" is summarized rather than earned through on-page struggle. The interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak ("a testament to this fundamental human impulse," "part of a larger narrative"), which reads as an authorial summary of a theme rather than a character's specific, embodied experience. There is no moment of genuine internal contradiction; the progression to self-awareness is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear but lacks interior contradiction. Her character is defined by her noble purpose and unique skills, reading more as an archetype for the story's theme than a person with complex, competing impulses. Emotions are labeled ("heart swelled with a sense of purpose") rather than embodied, and her breakthrough feels like an intellectual exercise without a visceral internal struggle preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The druid's motivation is clearly stated but remains abstract. Interiority is summarized with labels like "trepidation and determination" and "warlike serenity" rather than embodied through specific, contradictory impulses in the scene. The character feels more like a vehicle for the thematic premise than a distinct individual whose flaws or limits drive the action; their key discoveries are presented to them rather than won through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear but primarily stated ("driven by a singular motivation: to find the intersection of dreams") rather than revealed through complex, contradictory choices. Her defining traits, "root-bound visionary" and "purposefully curious," function as labels that justify the plot but lack deep interiority or internal conflict. The emotions are named ("anxious elation," "surge of excitement") but not fully embodied in a character-particular way, reading more as a summary of a state than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is explicitly stated but her primary trait, "reckless," is an unearned label that never informs her actions. The internal transformation is summarized using diagnostic language ("to patch holes in her soul," "becoming more whole") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choices. Her change from despair to resolve feels abrupt and overly tidy, lacking the friction of a genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but his internal state is delivered through summary and labels ("confidently uncertain," "spark of determination") rather than embodied experience. The emotional progression feels rushed in the final paragraphs, presenting an unearned series of epiphanies instead of a dramatized, contradictory internal struggle. Jack's shift from suffocated to resolved lacks a compelling micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara's character is defined by labels—"kindly methodical," "gift for analogical thinking"—rather than demonstrated through action under pressure. Her interiority is almost entirely summary, reporting on her cognitive processes with phrases like "began to ponder" and "felt herself drawing closer." The story lacks any internal conflict or embodied emotion; her path to success is a linear, frictionless intellectual exercise, which undermines the claim that her ambitions "haunted" her.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.5)
    The librarian’s motivation is explicitly stated ("to preserve wonder in routine") but never tested. The character reads as a philosophical vessel rather than an individual with internal contradictions; their state of "harmonious blend" is declared from the start, leaving no room for struggle or earned change. Interiority is presented through abstract, diagnostic labels ("fluidity of identity," "migrating identities") instead of embodied, in-scene experience, which flattens the character into an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization is weak due to an over-reliance on abstract, diagnostic labels for interiority. Emotions are stated ("felt a sense of peace") rather than embodied, and the internal conflict ("confront the walls... built around her own heart") is summarized, not dramatized. Aria's transformation reads as an unearned epiphany, lacking the friction of contradictory impulses acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara's motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and drives the narrative. However, her characterization relies on labels like "truth-seeking river chronicler" and "daringly methodical nature" which are asserted rather than demonstrated through specific, contradictory actions. Her interiority often slips into summarizing the story's theme ("forgiveness was not a destination, but a path"), which feels more like an authorial conclusion than a character's messy, in-the-moment thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent, but their characterization remains abstract. Interiority is described with elevated labels like "cautious exuberance" rather than shown through specific, contradictory impulses. While the final change is significant, the lack of a concrete internal struggle makes the epiphany feel more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.3)
    The character's motivation is a collection of abstract labels—a "dream," an "empire," a "promise"—that lack concrete detail. Elian's final shift from passive contemplation to resolute action feels unearned, as it's triggered by an off-page revelation from the coffee stains. Interiority relies on stock phrasing like "simmering in her heart" and "depths of her soul," which tells the reader her state without embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aria’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on labeling emotions like "turmoil" and "sorrow" rather than fully embodying them. While the final emotional state is earned through her actions, the internal conflict could have been dramatized with more concrete, contradictory impulses in the moment rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    Aria’s characterization is built on labels ("kindly decisive") rather than demonstrated through costly choices. Her internal conflict is summarized, not dramatized; emotions are stated ("felt a sense of peace") rather than embodied. The major backstory element, "forgiving the unforgivable," is dropped in without anchoring to a present-tense choice, feeling like unearned depth. The final change is an intellectual epiphany, not a visceral, earned shift resulting from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character is built on an interesting paradox ("sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability"), but remains an abstraction. Motivation is explicitly stated rather than revealed through meaningful choice. The final moment of self-reflection in the mirror shard is a strong beat showing internal contradiction, but the preceding interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels like "complex web of fears," which flattens the character into a concept.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    The characters are archetypes of a serene master and a receptive student, lacking internal conflict or specific, embodied interiority. The researcher's defining trait, "backwards aging," is an ornamental label with no impact on her actions or choices. Motivation is clearly stated but never tested or complicated, resulting in flat characterization where success is assumed rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The skimmer's motivation is clear but its characterization is static and conceptual. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; it reads as a serene philosophical vessel rather than a character experiencing struggle. Its "weathered resolve" is asserted but never truly tested by a counter-desire, limiting the depth of its endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eira’s motivation is clearly established but remains abstract. Her internal state is summarized rather than embodied; the story tells us she fears withering away, but we don't feel the sharp edges of that fear in her actions or perceptions. The final epiphany feels more like a logical conclusion than a hard-won, contradictory emotional breakthrough, lacking a visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    The character's motivation is clear but entirely abstract, making Kael feel more like a narrative device than a person. His interiority is conveyed through stock phrases like "heart quickened" and "sense of wonder," lacking specific, embodied emotion. The final epiphany is asserted rather than earned through struggle or a difficult choice, making the character's profound change feel unconvincing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character is more of a function than a person, defined by a few evocative but ultimately un-dramatized labels like "quietly enthusiastic." Interiority relies on summary ("felt a thrill of excitement," "felt a sense of peace") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. While the motivation is clear, the character's journey lacks meaningful internal conflict or a choice with visible trade-offs, reading as a procedural fulfillment of a pre-ordained role.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.5)
    The reaper's motivation—grief for a lost love channeled into a cosmic task—is clear and consistent. However, the character's interiority relies heavily on summary and emotional labels ("heartbroken," "bittersweet ache," "deep desire") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses within the scene. The final shift to "peace" feels more asserted than earned, as the preceding action is a symbolic ritual rather than a crucible that forces a difficult internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization is thin, relying on labels like "lukewarm" and "earnestly naive" without dramatizing these traits through action or contradictory impulse. The mage's motivation to "right a cosmic imbalance" remains abstract and intellectual. The internal conflict of "brittle devotion" is a concept the character contemplates rather than a struggle they experience in the scene, rendering them more of a thematic vessel than a specific individual.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.5)
    The warden's motivation is exceptionally clear but entirely one-dimensional, stated repeatedly without any internal contradiction or complexity. The character acts as a vessel for the story's theme rather than a person experiencing conflict; emotions are labeled ("felt a sense of purpose") rather than embodied. Actions consist of walking and observing, with no difficult micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on summary and emotional labels ("felt an instant sense of wonder," "The touch of wonder was something Elara cherished"). The character arc is a linear progression toward insight without the friction of contradictory impulses acting in-scene, which makes the final change feel somewhat smooth and unearned for a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on repeating thematic labels like "watcher's burden" and "preserving the trust." The characterization lacks genuine internal conflict; she is presented as singularly competent and resolute, which makes her feel more like an archetype than a flawed individual. The emotional state is described rather than fully embodied, missing an opportunity for deeper nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaito's motivation is clear, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic labels like "ego death" and "emotional numbness." The transformation is summarized rather than dramatized through embodied, contradictory impulses. His epiphany feels more like a declared outcome than an earned struggle, as seen in the line, "the opposites within him began to reconcile," which tells us the result without showing the process.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The proprietor's motivation is explicitly stated ("a desire to safeguard space for innovation") rather than demonstrated through choices under pressure. Her interiority is a smooth, linear progression from mystery to solution, lacking the contradiction and embodied emotion of a character in a crucible. She reads more as a vessel for the theme of creativity than a distinct individual with flaws or competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Maestro's motivation is clear, but his characterization remains archetypal. Interiority is conveyed through generalized statements like "poured his heart into the performance" rather than specific, contradictory impulses shown in action. The core trait "mournfully eager" is stated but doesn't create a tangible internal conflict or force a difficult micro-choice; it functions more as a static mood descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    The guardian's motivation to "make friends with uncertainty" is clear, but her characterization remains abstract. Interiority relies heavily on conceptual labels ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") rather than specific, embodied emotion. The final shift to peace feels more like a declared epiphany ("She realized that the cultist's pendant was...a key") than a choice earned through a visible struggle with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's motivation is clear but delivered through summary rather than dramatized internal conflict. Phrases like "stoically sensitive to the world's suffering" and "deep-seated desire to interrupt a stifling destiny" are diagnostic labels, not embodied traits. The final change feels more like a successful plot outcome than a deeply earned internal shift, as the alchemist's core contradiction is explained rather than shown in action.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but remains abstract, lacking the specificity to drive compelling choices. Interiority relies heavily on labeling emotions ("felt serenely electric," "felt a pang of nostalgia") rather than embodying them through contradictory impulses or visceral reactions. While her actions align with her stated goal, she functions more as a passive receiver of cosmic information than an agent wrestling with a genuine internal conflict. The character arc is a simple, linear progression from seeking to finding, without the friction of flaws or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara’s motivation is a significant weakness, reading as a label rather than an earned drive. The leap from "ardent ferry deckhand" to being "driven by a deep-seated motivation to merge parallel timelines and restore balance to the cosmos" is vast and ungrounded by any on-page event or specific character trait. This core motive feels imposed upon the character to fit a high-concept plot, rather than emerging from her established personality or experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is more a conceptual vessel than a character with compelling interiority. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("searching for the texture of connection") rather than revealed through meaningful, contradictory choices. While her actions are consistent, the characterization remains abstract, lacking the specific flaws or internal conflicts that would make her transformation feel earned beyond a conceptual level.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.5)
    Lyra's characterization is flat and serves as a vessel for the story's theme. Her motivation is stated directly ("driven by a deep-seated motivation") but never tested or shown through choices under pressure. Her interiority consists of abstract, repetitive summaries of the theme rather than specific, contradictory thoughts, making her feel more like a symbol than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear but presented as a job description rather than a deeply felt internal need. Her character is defined by her function ("contact tracer for hearts") and a stated trait ("persistently curious"), but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotion; we are told she feels a "sense of responsibility" rather than experiencing it through her actions or perceptions. The woman is more of a catalyst for Aria's heroism than a fully realized character, serving primarily as a recipient of comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's characterization is built on a pile of declared traits rather than dramatized choices. The core descriptor, "claustrophobic spelunker," is a fascinating contradiction that the story states and then ignores, doing no work. Her motivation shifts from professional (codex), to survival (escape), to sentimental ("stand by the unremembered") without these layers creating authentic internal conflict; they are simply stacked assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    Akira’s motivation is clear but remains somewhat abstract. The shift from uncovering secrets to seeking wisdom is the central turn, but it is presented as a sudden realization rather than a choice born from embodied internal conflict. Emotions are described with labels like "midnight solace" and "quiet determination" rather than being fully dramatized through contradictory impulses or specific, character-particular interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    The storyteller's motivation is clear and consistent, but the character serves more as an archetypal vessel for the story's concept than a developed individual. There is no internal conflict or embodied emotion; interiority is stated ("felt an urgency") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The characterization is functional for this mythic, textural piece, but lacks the specificity and depth required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lena’s motivation to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a specific choice or action. Her internal journey consists of a passive sequence of "feeling" states rather than contradictory impulses or earned changes. Character traits like "gravitationally playful" and "quirky sense of humor" are labels that lack any embodiment in the scene, reading as unearned diagnostic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.5)
    Luna is a function, not a character. Her motivation is stated repeatedly but never embodied through a difficult choice or internal conflict. She has no flaws, contradictions, or personal stakes beyond her abstract mission, rendering her a flat archetype whose success feels preordained and emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.5)
    The mailman’s motivation, “to find where broken promises heal,” is an intriguing concept but remains an abstract label rather than a dramatized internal conflict. His interiority relies on stock phrases like “renewed sense of purpose” and the character-defining trait “respectfully rebellious” is stated but never demonstrated. The final emotional shift feels more like an authorial summary of a theme than an earned, embodied change, particularly in the line about unleashing a "tempest - one of hope and redemption."

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The carpenter's motivation is clear but overly stated ("To interpret silence as possibility was their motivation"). While their actions are consistent with this goal, the interiority relies on labels like "curiosity piqued" and "newfound sense of purpose" instead of embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The final choice to embrace ambiguity over certainty is a strong moment, but the character reads more as an archetypal vessel for the theme than a specific, flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The librarian's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains a static portrait. The "sanely eccentric" trait is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Interiority often summarizes her beliefs ("She believed that stories...") rather than showing a mind in the process of discovery, which limits the character's depth beyond her role as a guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear but abstract ("capture a runaway dream"), leading to a character who feels more like a vessel for atmosphere than a person with complex interiority. There are no contradictory impulses shown in scene; Elian exists in a single, sustained state of longing and artistic focus. While the motivation is consistent, it doesn't intensify or lead to higher-stakes choices, resulting in a flat character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The locksmith is more of a function than a character, an archetypal figure executing a task. Motivation is stated ("to free this idea") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final "surge of improbable longing" is a strong beat that provides a glimpse of interiority, but it feels somewhat unearned as it's the first moment of genuine, particular emotion in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority often relies on declarative labels ("chronically curious," "familiar thrill of excitement") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The conflict between her scientific and personal goals is stated rather than dramatized simultaneously. While her actions align with her motives, the emotional experience reads as summarized, lacking the specific, idiosyncratic texture needed for a top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong, anchored by the compelling contradiction of "combative tenderness" and the physical manifestation of anxiety ("walking backwards") that resolves as confidence is gained. The motivation to "mentor resilience" is clear, though slightly abstract. The archivist’s internal arc from anxious precision to quiet triumph is well-realized and earned through the process of their work, making the final "small, fierce smile" a potent moment.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's motivation is clear, but her characterization is static and archetypal. She acts as a flawless vessel for the story's magic rather than a person with internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her interiority is stated ("filled Aria's heart with peace") but not embodied in a specific or surprising way, and her success feels preordained due to her asserted wisdom and creativity, which are never tested.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is explicit and consistently drives her actions. However, her interiority feels abstract and is conveyed through labels ("quiet intent," "lucid unrest") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. She reads more as a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual with a specific inner life.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara’s character is defined by stated traits (“methodically curious”) rather than demonstrated through complex choices. Her internal journey relies heavily on label-only emotions like “unshakeable sense” and “sense of awe,” which abstracts her experience instead of embodying it. The pivotal shift from skepticism to belief is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized internal conflict or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the interiority relies on summary and diagnostic labels like "a sophisticated sorrow." While the intellectual journey is well-defined, the emotional arc feels more described than embodied, which slightly undermines the cost of the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    The balladeer's motivation is clearly stated ("to articulate unspoken needs") but lacks embodied internal conflict. Her character is defined by labels like "seldom-heard," "driftingly alert," and a "tinkersong" sensibility, which are asserted rather than demonstrated through contradictory choices. While her actions align with her stated motive, her interiority feels more like a thematic vessel than a complex individual grappling with a specific, personal need that drives the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Phrases like "warmly inquisitive," "affectionate detachment," and motivations being "to seek out the joy beneath the anguish" are told to the reader directly. The internal change at the end is asserted ("her heart was filled with a sense of peace") rather than earned through a visible struggle or a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra's motivation is clear, but her interiority feels more like a vehicle for the story's thematic keywords than an organic thought process. Her internal monologue, which uses phrases like "spooled wholeness" and "empty spaces remembered," reads as overly articulate and diagnostic, undercutting the authenticity of her experience. This is particularly noticeable in the final epiphany, which feels intellectually asserted rather than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)
    The artist's motivation is clearly stated ("to mirror the sky inside walls") but feels more like an assigned theme than an earned, internal drive. Characterization remains abstract; we see the artist's skill but not their specific interior contradictions or flaws. The "face blind" trait, a potentially rich source of conflict or unique perception, is an un-integrated label that never affects a choice or the way the artist sees their work.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, stemming from their "diligently curious" nature. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction; Eli's journey is a smooth progression of discovery without facing any difficult trade-offs or personal flaws that complicate their choices. The decision to keep the discovery secret is the only moment of friction, but it's resolved with little internal debate, making the character feel more functional than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation is explicitly stated ("to learn the rhythm of repair") but remains an abstract concept rather than a dramatized need. The characterization lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; Kael is a passive observer on a frictionless journey. The final epiphany is asserted ("felt a deep connection") rather than earned through a choice with a visible cost, reading as a summary of a change rather than an embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization is superficial, relying on labels like "altruistic" and "strangely trustworthy" rather than dramatized choices under pressure. Aria's motivation is stated directly but lacks any internal conflict or contradiction. The settlers, including the named Lyra, function as a monolithic, compliant collective without individual agency or voice, rendering them props for the plot's execution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character is a functional archetype, defined entirely by their cosmic role. Motivation is clear but lacks personal texture or internal conflict beyond a stated "burden of bruised awe." Emotions are labeled ("a sense of pride and accomplishment") rather than embodied, and the character's perfect execution of their task offers no moment of struggle, doubt, or difficult micro-choice, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.5)
    The caretaker's motivation shifts from "reluctant" to "determined" based on finding a nut, an unconvincing and abrupt turn. Her internal state is conveyed through summary and emotional labels ("felt an odd sense of connection," "felt a sudden surge of determination") rather than embodied experience or contradictory impulses. The final feeling of peace is earned only superficially, as the initial reluctance was never dramatized as a significant internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "worked through her emotions" and "loosened grief," which summarize rather than embody her state. The central epiphany, while pivotal, feels more like a convenient cognitive solution than a deeply earned, contradictory emotional shift. The transformation from grief to purpose is too tidy, lacking the messy, embodied struggle of a character genuinely grappling with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, and the internal conflict between the desire to "incise" and the "vendor's creed" provides a solid anchor for her choice. However, the final profound realization feels more like a sudden, unearned epiphany than a change earned through specific, dramatized struggle. Interiority occasionally uses stock phrasing like "unexpected sense of calm" and "overwhelming desire," slightly flattening the character's particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is more summarized than dramatized. Phrases like "turmoil in her mind" and the final "sense of resolution" are labels that abstract her emotional state. The central conflict is experienced, but her internal contradictions are not shown acting simultaneously in a way that would elevate the characterization beyond a functional level.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies on telling the reader traits through labels like "harmoniously choral" and "empathetically decisive" rather than dramatizing them through choices with tangible costs. Emilia's interiority is summarized with stock phrases ("felt a sense of kinship," "heart full of... hope") instead of being embodied. The result is a character who serves as a thematic vessel rather than a complex individual facing a genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but her characterization relies on abstract, unearned labels like "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" instead of demonstrated traits. Her interiority is summarized with diagnostic labels ("exhilarating and unsettling") rather than embodied through contradictory actions or specific sensory details. She reads less like an individual and more like a high-concept archetype designed to execute the plot without believable struggle or internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels like "prism-minded" and "latent blaze" rather than demonstrated, contradictory impulses. Her interiority is competent but lacks a specific, individual texture; she proceeds with unwavering determination and competence, which lessens the feeling of genuine struggle. The character serves the plot effectively but feels more like an archetypal vessel than a uniquely flawed individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is explicitly stated but remains one-dimensional. Interiority relies on abstract labels like "symphonically minded" instead of dramatizing contradictory impulses or a difficult choice. The sculptor functions more as a consistent, idealized vessel for the story's theme than as a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.5)
    The characterization relies heavily on labels ("thoughtfully precise," "seeker of truth") rather than demonstrated traits. His internal state is described with diagnostic clarity ("an overwhelming sense of hope amidst the melancholy"), which flattens the emotional experience. The final shift to a "seeker" feels more like an asserted epiphany than an earned transformation resulting from an on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is stated ("overwhelming urge," "deep desire to catalog") rather than dramatized through compelling internal conflict. The character trait "eclectic pacifist" is entirely ornamental and has no bearing on her actions. The story bypasses the central moral contradiction of a pacifist who values understanding violating a friend's trust; her emotions are described with abstract labels ("deep connection") rather than embodied with the complex, contradictory feelings such an act would entail.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra's motivation is clear but lacks depth. The defining trait of "ambitious" is stated but never dramatized through a difficult choice or sacrifice; her actions are passive and receptive. Her interiority is conveyed through generalized statements of feeling ("felt a sudden surge of energy," "felt an increasing sense of anticipation") rather than specific, contradictory impulses. The final state of serenity is achieved, but because no significant internal conflict was shown, it feels more like a placid arrival than an earned resolution with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, establishing her as a competent professional. However, her interiority is thin and relies on telling rather than showing emotion; phrases like "felt an inexplicable connection" and "felt a sense of wonder and awe" are labels rather than embodied experiences. The character lacks any meaningful flaw or internal conflict, which makes her success feel predetermined and robs the discovery of deeper personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.5)
    The investigator’s motivation is clear but delivered through abstract, declarative statements like "driven by a desire to cultivate foresight in action." The character feels more like a conduit for the story's theme than a person with a specific inner life. Emotions are labeled ("felt a shiver," "felt a sense of clarity") rather than embodied, and her interiority uses repeating, essay-like phrases ("hazy precision") that read as authorial intrusion rather than authentic thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian's motivation is clear but one-dimensional; she is a vessel for the story's concept rather than a character with internal contradictions. Her interiority is described in abstract, elevated terms ("kaleidoscope of colors," "essence of sound") but lacks embodied emotion or specific, contradictory impulses during the performance. The characterization is competent but thin, serving the theme without generating friction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is stated with diagnostic clarity ("To harvest insights from failure was her true motivation") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The character's transformation is similarly asserted ("She felt changed, transformed") instead of being embodied in a specific, costly choice or altered perception in the final beats. Her interiority reads more as a summary of a state than a lived, contradictory experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Echo's motivation is singular and clear, driving the entire narrative. However, the characterization remains somewhat abstract, relying on labels like "obsession" and "feverish intensity" rather than fully embodied emotion. The stated attribute of borrowing personalities is an interesting idea that remains entirely undramatized, functioning as a piece of inert backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eira’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on labels ("jittery," "quiet purpose") than on embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Her core mission is articulated as a thematic statement rather than emerging from a deeper, more specific internal conflict, which flattens her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mystic’s motivation is clearly stated but her interiority remains abstract. Emotions are labeled ("calming and unnerving") rather than embodied, and there's no dramatized internal conflict; she proceeds toward her goal with a lack of friction or contradictory impulses. The character reads more as a functional vessel for the theme than a person experiencing a difficult, transformative event.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The loom spinner's motivation is clear, and her internal journey from melancholy to resolve forms a coherent arc. However, her emotional state is often described with abstract labels ("wistful," "melancholic reverie," "turmoil") rather than shown through specific, embodied actions or contradictory impulses. The final motivation of "latent sacrifice" is asserted in the final act rather than being earned through a demonstrated choice or trade-off, slightly weakening the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies on abstract labels ("azure defiance," "comprehension and confusion") rather than embodied emotion. While the shift from solitary creator to mentor is a meaningful change, the internal experience reads as overly articulate and self-aware, lacking the friction of genuine internal conflict acting in the scene. The character serves the theme well but feels more like a philosophical archetype than a specific, flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is explicitly stated ("to discover the weight of a withheld truth") but remains an abstract label. Her interiority consists of summarized thoughts rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Phrases like "her thoughts turned to" and "felt a thrill of excitement" are generic and performative. The character acts more as a passive observer being pulled through events than an agent making choices, which weakens the final "earned" revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The skipper's interiority is consistent and his motivation to protect the lighthouse's safety is clear. The central contradiction—a reticent man with a deeply felt, observant nature—is established well. However, his internal state is articulated with repetitive, slightly abstract diagnostic language ("luminescent ache"), which lessens the impact of his earned stasis at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.1)
    The herald is an archetype, not a character. Her motivation is stated but her interiority consists of labels like "joyful expression" and "shadowed elation" rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. She experiences no internal conflict or meaningful struggle; she is a flawless functionary of the plot, which makes her feel distant and unrelatable.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaito's motivation is clear but his characterization as a "dye master" is not integrated; this profession never informs his specific perceptions or actions. His interiority relies on abstract labels like "iridescent caution" and "insatiable curiosity" rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The final epiphany feels more like a thematic statement delivered to the character than a discovery earned through internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character reads as a functionary for the magic system rather than an individual. Motivation is stated, not dramatized, and shifts without clear cause, from deconstructing sorrow to understanding trees. Interiority relies on generic labels like "a sense of wonder" and "a steady hum," lacking the specific, contradictory impulses of a compelling character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    The memory keeper is more of a role than a character with individualized depth. Her motivation is clearly stated but never tested by internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. Emotions are labeled ("felt drawn," "felt a sense of hope") rather than embodied, making her a passive vessel for the story's theme instead of a complex agent driving it.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elys's motivation is clear, but their characterization relies on labels like "compassionate" and "keenly empathetic" which are never demonstrated through action. The emotional climax, "Elys felt a sense of enlarged tranquility wash over them," is a classic example of telling instead of showing, a diagnostic summary that prevents the reader from experiencing the change alongside the character. The internal conflict is resolved too neatly by an external message, making the transformation feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to find "tenuous absolution" is clear, but her interiority is more summarized than embodied. Phrases like "felt a pang of recognition" label the emotion rather than letting the reader experience it through concrete perception. The character remains consistent but lacks the internal contradiction or difficult micro-choices needed to elevate her beyond a vessel for the story's mood.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. Her emotional journey from excitement to satisfaction is linear and lacks internal conflict or contradiction. Emotions are more often stated ("felt a thrill," "felt a sense of wonder") than embodied, which keeps the reader at a distance from her internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lena’s motivation is bifurcated and unclear; she seeks a watch fob for family secrets, but is also on a mission to "capture the sound of trust breaking." This second motive is abstract and never grounded in action, reading as an unearned label. Her internal state is described with stock phrases ("heart quickened") and self-diagnostics ("comforting unease"), rather than embodied through specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria's central conflict between skepticism and mystical curiosity is clearly established and drives the narrative. Her motivation is consistent, leading to the final choice to connect with the stranger. However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary labels like "felt a sense of futuristic nostalgia" instead of fully embodied emotion, and the final "surge of understanding" feels more told than shown, slightly weakening an otherwise earned character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies too heavily on abstract labels like "auroral sorrow" and "a newfound sense of purpose." This diagnostic language summarizes her emotional state rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory impulses in the scene. The change is earned through action, but the character's internal experience feels more told than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains thin. Her core trait—ink wilting near dishonesty—is a compelling hook that is unfortunately abandoned after its introduction, never constraining an on-page choice. The final change feels more asserted than earned, as we are told of her newfound purpose rather than experiencing the internal struggle that would make it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.5)
    Aria is a functional archetype, not a character. Her motivation to "preserve the color of wonder" is stated but never tested or complicated by internal conflict or external opposition. She proceeds from intent to frictionless success, making her journey feel predetermined and lacking in emotional depth or earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic labels like "inner static" and "fragmented wholeness." This prevents a genuinely embodied emotional experience, making her internal conflict feel summarized rather than lived. The final emotional shift is declared ("Aria felt a sense of peace") rather than earned through a granular, contradictory process, reading more like a solved equation than a character's complex resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    Emilia’s motivation is stated rather than felt; her drive "to prove that listening heals" reads like an authorial thesis, not a compelling personal need. Her interiority is composed of generic labels ("inexplicable connection," "sense of satisfaction") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The character functions as a vehicle for the plot and theme without a distinct internal life or meaningful flaw that complicates her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.5)
    Aria’s motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, relying on abstract labels like "calm defiance" and "encrypt her vulnerability as strength." Her interiority feels like a summary of emotions instead of an embodied experience with contradictory impulses, making her journey from entrapment to resolve feel smooth and unconflicted. Her actions, like the dance, are described but lack consequence or cost, rendering her a vessel for the theme rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character’s motivation is clear but stated rather than consistently embodied. The lighter functions more as a passive vessel for the plot's conceptual elements until the final act, lacking the internal conflict or contradictory impulses expected for a top-tier piece. The final change feels earned by the climactic event, but the character's interiority leading up to it is too thin.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.5)
    The summoner's motivation is clear but one-dimensional; they exist solely to perform the task. There is no internal conflict, contradiction, or meaningful flaw. The character reads as a competent functionary for the plot, lacking the specific interiority or embodied emotion required for a higher score; their state is described with labels like "serenity" rather than dramatized through complex choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    The characters are functional archetypes (wise mentor, eager student) whose motivations are clearly stated but lack deep interiority or contradiction. The student's motivation is revealed through direct questioning, and their internal change is asserted ("felt a shiver," "would never see the world in the same way again") rather than embodied through a difficult choice. The tutor's satisfaction is similarly declared, making the characterization feel more illustrative than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is stated rather than dramatized. The transition from "charmed skeptic" to resolved individual feels more like a summary of a change than an earned, on-page struggle. Her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels like "she realized now" and "the process was cathartic," which flattens the emotional complexity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The forger’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on elegant labels ("master of her craft," "wisely enduring") than on dramatized internal conflict. While her competence is believable, the absence of any tangible struggle or moment of doubt makes her feel more like an archetype than a person. The emotional resolution is stated ("sense of pride and accomplishment," "peace") rather than fully embodied in a contradictory or complex way.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria's motivation is clear, but her characterization remains archetypal. Her interiority consists of abstract states ("felt the webs...begin to vibrate") rather than specific, contradictory impulses. Emotions are labeled ("reed-blown melancholy") instead of embodied, making her more of a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual whose choices feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria's motivation is clearly stated but not deeply dramatized. Her interiority relies on declarative statements ("Her motivation was...") and generic emotional labels ("felt a jolt," "filled with a sense of wonder") rather than specific, embodied experience. The core trait of "weaves truth carefully" is asserted but never tested in a choice with consequence, making her feel more like a vessel for the story's concepts than a character with internal contradictions acting under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character is a consistent archetype, but her interiority is more stated than embodied. Phrases like "demure audacity" and "scintillatingly somber demeanor" are authorial labels that aren't dramatized through action or meaningful internal conflict. The final epiphany feels unearned because it's achieved without overcoming any tangible or psychological obstacle, making the character arc feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria’s motivation is clearly stated but her character remains a functional archetype rather than a specific individual. Her defining trait as a "debunker" is asserted but never dramatized as internal conflict; her shift to "wonder and awe" at the end feels unearned because her skepticism presents no on-page resistance. Interiority relies on summary labels like "her mind racing" and "curiosity was piqued" instead of embodied thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.5)
    The visionary is a passive archetype defined by labels ("lonely," "lyrically prophetic") rather than a character forged by choices. Her motivation is stated but never tested, and her interiority consists of abstract summaries ("lost in thought," "felt a sense of calm") instead of embodied emotion or internal conflict. The pivotal shift from observer to active "guiding force" occurs off-page, rendering her arc unearned and emotionally sterile.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet's motivation is clear, but his internal state is often conveyed through abstract labels ("gleaned redemption," "lonesome splendor") rather than embodied emotion. The shift from oppressive silence to a flowing river of words is a significant character change, but it feels more like a summarized epiphany than a fully dramatized internal struggle. The core contradiction between despair and purpose is present but resolved a little too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "logically emotional mind" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. We are repeatedly told about her internal state—a mix of logic, emotion, peace, and purpose—instead of experiencing it through embodied action or conflicting choices. This reliance on summary over scene prevents the characterization from achieving genuine depth or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mapper’s motivation is stated clearly but remains abstract. Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels (“restrained wildness,” “deep-seated motivation”) rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The central conflict of sculpting patience from impatience is a compelling idea, but it’s summarized as a past achievement rather than dramatized as an active, internal struggle in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.5)
    Maya's motivation is clearly stated but her internal transformation is summarized rather than dramatized. Phrases like "untangle the threads of entangled memories" and "shedding a skin that had been holding her back" are diagnostic labels that tell the reader about her change instead of showing contradictory impulses acting in the scene. Her primary trait, "watchfully calm," is mentioned but doesn't demonstrably enable or constrain a choice with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    The chaplain's motivation is clear, but his internal journey relies on unearned epiphanies and emotional labels. The shift in his perspective feels too easy, prompted by convenient external symbols rather than a dramatized internal struggle. Phrases like "he felt a sense of clarity wash over him" summarize the change rather than embodying it, lacking the contradiction and concrete embodiment expected for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.5)
    Zephyr’s motivation is clear but one-dimensional; her primary trait, "steadily curious," is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized through choices with costs. Interiority remains abstract, describing states like "irreverent awe" without specific, embodied emotion or internal conflict. The final transformation is an unearned epiphany, as the preceding struggle is summarized as "painstaking" but not shown, resulting in a character that feels more like a vehicle for a concept than a realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lena's motivation is clear but shifts due to an external prompt ("Don't lie to yourself, Lena") rather than an internal, contradictory choice made in-scene. Her obsession is stated more than it is embodied in specific, escalating actions beyond "scanning" and "poring." The final transformation into a state of "wonder and awe" feels more like an asserted epiphany than a change earned through a difficult, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is articulated in abstract, diagnostic language ("to map empathy onto action") rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. Her interiority remains generic, relying on labels like "calmly intuitive" and "courageous anomaly" without showing these traits through moments of struggle or contradiction. The resolution feels unearned as she encounters no internal or external obstacles, rendering her a competent functionary rather than a compelling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc from suicidal despair to fragile peace is legible, but the interiority relies too heavily on abstract labeling. Phrases like "I felt a sense of..." are repeated to announce emotional shifts rather than embodying them through specific, contradictory perceptions. While the motivation is clear, the final emotional state feels more declared than fully earned, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undermines the crisis's rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    The sentinel serves more as a thematic vessel than a character with compelling internal contradictions. Her motivation crystallizes into an abstract, diagnostic label ("to nurture intersubjective understanding") rather than an embodied, personal goal. This lack of specific, contradictory impulses acting in-scene flattens the characterization, making her feel more like a function of the theme than an individual experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the interiority is conveyed through abstract labels rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "felt a sense of stillness" and "acknowledging the turmoil" summarize the internal state without dramatizing the conflict. The key attribute, being "strangely honest," is asserted once as a label to justify self-awareness but doesn't manifest as a choice with a visible tradeoff, limiting character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Luna's motivation is clearly stated but remains an abstract concept rather than a compelling, embodied drive. Her characterization is consistent but flat; she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Phrases like "perceptively calm demeanor" are labels that are never tested by the story's frictionless, serene environment, making her feel more like a thematic vessel than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scholar's internal conflict between reticent isolation and a nascent resolve is well-realized and embodied. The motivation to decode the pattern is clear, and the final choice to testify feels earned by the external pressure applied. The shift from detachment to resolve is credible, with the cost—the loss of a safe, isolated world—made explicit and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prophet’s motivation is clear and her final shift in perspective is earned. However, the characterization is weakened by a key contradiction, "precognitive forgetfulness," which is introduced as a significant obstacle but resolved too easily to create genuine pressure. Furthermore, some interiority relies on abstract labels rather than fully embodied emotion, slightly flattening the character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eli's motivation is stated ("harness the ephemeral") rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. His character is more of a vessel for philosophical ideas than a person with embodied, contradictory impulses. The sudden shift from "camera repairer" to a physicist capable of reinforcing an entire observatory against seismic events strains credibility and feels unearned. His internal state is described with abstract labels like "sense of wonder" and "luminous ache" instead of being shown through specific, character-particular actions or perceptions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lena's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels like "decisively kind" and "deep compassion" rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. Her interiority is summarized, not dramatized, which flattens her into a functionary of the theme rather than a complex individual. Emma exists primarily as a recipient of Lena's care, lacking agency or a distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's characterization relies on labels ("quietly deliberate," "insatiable curiosity") rather than dramatized choices under pressure. Her motivation is clear but lacks embodied urgency, functioning more as a plot container than a deeply felt need. There is no internal conflict; her process is described as a linear, meticulous intellectual exercise without contradiction or struggle, which flattens her character into a functional scholar archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on labels like "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent" rather than dramatizing these contradictory traits through action or choice. Emilia’s internal journey is over-articulated with diagnostic self-awareness, as seen in phrases like "a cleft in certainty began to form." The epiphany feels unearned and intellectually summarized, lacking the messy, embodied struggle that would make her change credible; it resolves too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's motivation is clear but lacks depth or internal conflict. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("deep pools of contemplation," "reflectively vibrant") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses shown in scene. The character serves as a consistent vessel for the theme, but their progression is a smooth, unconflicted path toward enlightenment, which lessens their complexity and feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on declarative statements like being "quietly proactive" or determined "to graft new meaning onto the old wounds." These labels function as therapy-speak, summarizing her state rather than embodying it through contradictory impulses in the moment. The final paragraph over-articulates the character change, which should have been left to resonate in the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The novelist's motivation is clear, but her interiority is overly articulate and diagnostic, stating her realizations rather than embodying them. The transformation feels unearned, a passive reception of insight rather than a choice born from dramatized internal conflict. Phrases like "a manifestation of her own subconscious" read as self-analysis that flattens the character's struggle into a tidy psychological summary.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She is presented as a flawless, benevolent force whose success is never in doubt, which removes any internal conflict or compelling contradiction. Interiority is summarized with labels like "determination" and "deep satisfaction" rather than embodied through specific, contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on external description than embodied interiority. Phrases like "the turmoil of emotions within her" and "a mix of exhaustion and triumph" are labels that summarize her state rather than showing it through specific perception or action. Her defining trait, patience, is well-demonstrated physically, but the lack of internal conflict or contradiction makes her feel more like a vessel for the ritual than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, anchored by the excellent "cellar of reason" metaphor. However, his characterization lacks dynamism; his internal state is summarized ("he felt his mind expanding") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The resolution feels tidy, a competent fulfillment of a goal rather than an earned change forged through internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    The weaver's motivation is stated but remains abstract, and her interiority is serene without meaningful contradiction. She is an archetype executing a ritual, not a character wrestling with contradictory impulses. While her focus is well-depicted, the story misses an opportunity for a more earned change; her final state feels like a successful task completion rather than a transformation born of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.5)
    The widow’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies too heavily on emotional summary and diagnostic labels. Phrases like "to contain the swirling emotions" and feeling the pain "become something manageable" read like therapy-speak, abstracting the emotion rather than embodying it. The character arc is credible, but the lack of internal contradiction or flawed, irrational impulses makes the progression feel somewhat tidy and pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.2)
    The scavenger's motivation is consistently stated in abstract, diagnostic terms ("negotiate with their own ghost, to reconcile the eroded ambitions") rather than dramatized through concrete choices. This label-speak flattens the character into a vessel for the theme. While the final action aligns with the stated motive, the internal conflict lacks embodied, contradictory impulses in-scene, reading more as a summary of a past struggle than a present one.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Maya’s motivation is stated but feels abstract and unembodied. Her interiority relies on labels like "stoic wonder" and "sense of purpose" rather than concrete, contradictory impulses shown in scene. The transition from curious observer to determined restorer happens via a single, unconflicted epiphany, lacking the struggle or internal friction that would make her final sense of hope feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear, but his internal journey relies on summary and diagnostic labels ("The bear's presence was a catalyst, prompting Elian to confront his past..."). The pivotal change feels more like an unearned epiphany than a choice born from contradictory impulses acting in a scene. The "moment of mutual understanding" with the bear is a sentimental shortcut that bypasses the harder work of dramatizing a complex internal shift with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra's motivation is stated ("understand the architecture of lies") but remains an abstract intellectual concept rather than a felt need. The climactic epiphany—realizing the lies were her own—reads as an unearned, diagnostic summary. There is little sense of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in the scene; the character proceeds with a placid determination that undercuts the claimed "upheaval."

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but the execution relies more on stating traits than embodying them. Phrases like "she was infinitely patient, a quality that served her well" and "The collector's motivation was to preserve these ancient methods" are labels. While her actions align with these motives, her interiority lacks the specific, contradictory texture of a lived-in mind, reading more like a summary of a character concept.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation to "understand the geography of healing" is clear and consistent. The voice, shaped by the unique profession of writing obituaries for the living, is specific and compelling. However, the interiority occasionally slips into self-diagnosis, explicitly stating thematic intentions ("I felt compelled to explain these absences") rather than purely embodying them, which slightly lessens the emotional impact of the earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prince's motivation is clear, but his interiority relies on telling rather than showing. Emotions are frequently named using label-only phrases ("felt a pang of sorrow," "felt a surge of excitement") instead of being embodied in specific, contradictory actions or perceptions. His emotional progression is linear and lacks the complex internal conflict expected for this tier, reading more as a summary of states than a lived experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria’s core motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on summary and diagnostic labels ("felt a surge of determination to prove that scars can sing"). The central conflict—arsonist’s daughter versus firefighter—is a strong premise, but it is explained rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment. Emotions are named rather than embodied, which flattens the character's internal struggle and makes the final resolution feel more intellectual than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.5)
    The characterization of Aria is superficial, relying on a string of descriptive labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative," "sidereal patience") that are asserted but never dramatized. There is no internal conflict; her "defiant hush" dismisses doubts that are never given weight, and her competence is absolute. The shift from seeker to guardian is a declared vow rather than an earned transformation resulting from a costly choice, rendering her an archetype serving the plot rather than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The sentimentalist's motivation is clear and consistent, but the character remains a thin, abstract archetype rather than a specific individual. Interiority consists of repeating philosophical concepts like "troubling serenity" and "intricate patterns" without much embodied emotion or internal contradiction. The character functions as a vessel for the theme but lacks the particularity and flawed humanity expected at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    The carver's motivation is clear but stated abstractly rather than embodied. Her interiority trends toward diagnostic label-speak ("she had been searching for a way to understand the shape of collective grief"), which summarizes her emotional state rather than letting it emerge from contradictory impulses in the scene. The change at the end feels more like a gentle, unresisted epiphany than a choice earned through struggle against a competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("ethically diligent nature," "desire to restore shared balance") and summarized emotions rather than embodied experience. Elara’s internal conflict is stated, not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in the scene. The transformation from turmoil to determination feels unearned, triggered by an external message rather than a difficult internal process, making her a vessel for the theme rather than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The gardener’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains somewhat thin. The interiority relies on declarative statements ("a quest that had consumed their every waking moment") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The initial descriptor "blithe" feels disconnected from the obsessive focus that follows, suggesting a trait that exists as a label without complicating the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    The cartographer's motivation is clear but remains an abstract statement of intent rather than a felt, embodied drive. Interiority relies on labels like "groundedly imaginative intensity" instead of showing contradictory impulses or a specific perceptual signature. The character acts as a vessel for the theme, lacking the particularity or internal friction needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    Emilia’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks deep internal conflict. The brief flicker of fear from the "presence behind her" is a strong embodied moment, but it resolves without consequence, leaving her as more of a dedicated vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization is thin and serves the theme too directly. Lena is more of a passive observer than an active agent, and her "inexplicable connection" is asserted rather than demonstrated. Eli functions as a mouthpiece for the story's thesis, with dialogue that is expository rather than natural, robbing their interaction of genuine tension or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael’s character is built on repeating labels like "wannabe philosopher" and "rationally rebellious" rather than dramatized choices. His internal conflict between "competing narratives" is summarized, not experienced as a simultaneous pull of contradictory impulses in-scene. While his motivation is clear, it feels asserted, and the final smile, while a valid micro-choice, lands without being fully earned by a preceding struggle that alters his state on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Emilia's motivation is exceptionally clear but presented as a label rather than an embodied drive. The interiority relies on abstract summaries ("felt a pang of nostalgia," "felt the weight of her task") instead of dramatizing contradictory impulses in the scene. The progression from "resigned" to "determined" is a smooth, rational path, lacking the friction of a genuine internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aria’s motivation is clear but lacks texture due to the absence of internal conflict. Her character is defined by a single, unwavering positive impulse—the "gentle rebellion"—which is never tested or complicated. The story tells us she is "informally wise," but this trait is not dramatized through a difficult choice. The final realization about her craft being "healing" feels like an unearned epiphany rather than a change forged through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    The characters are archetypes rather than individuals. The toll keeper's defining trait, being "involuntarily truthful," is stated but never dramatized to create conflict or cost. The motivation, "to preserve wonder in routine," arrives as an unearned, self-aware diagnosis in the final act, functioning as a thematic label instead of an embodied drive that shapes prior choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.5)
    Eli's motivation is clear but lacks depth. She is more of a vessel for the story's conceptual exploration than a character with compelling internal contradictions. Her defining trait, "creeping normality noticer," feels like an imposed label rather than an embodied way of being. The final change is declared ("she had been forever changed") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or a tangible cost, making the epiphany feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    The statue's character is conceptually interesting, but its core trait, "incisively kind," is stated rather than dramatized through a costly choice. The internal journey from passive observer to active interpreter is clear, but the emotional resolution—a "sense of peace" and "deep sense of satisfaction"—is declared in summary form, lacking the embodied, contradictory texture expected in high-caliber fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is clear but overly reliant on abstract labels like "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" rather than demonstrating these contradictory traits through conflicting micro-choices. Interiority is consistent but verges on diagnostic self-awareness, particularly in its philosophical musings. The final choice to embrace the journey is earned within the story's logic, but the characterization lacks a deeper, more embodied complexity beyond its stated intellectual obsessions.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    The painter's motivation is clear but abstractly stated ("to prove that strangers could recall the gentle touch") rather than fully embodied. Her interiority relies on summary ("her thoughts began to wander," "memories swirled") instead of showing contradictory impulses in the moment. The transition to creative action is believable, but the character reads as an idealized archetype of an artist rather than a complex individual with specific, contradictory flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elena's motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through choice. Her character is defined by labels like "cultured" and "historically oriented" but lacks internal conflict or a meaningful contradiction. The final "sense of purpose" is an unearned affirmation of her initial state, not a change earned through overcoming a challenge, making her arc feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.5)
    The clock maker's motivation is clear but one-dimensional, driven solely by a "hunger to uncover secrets." His defining trait, "neatly inventive," is stated rather than consistently embodied in a unique way beyond the basic act of solving the puzzle. The story lacks meaningful internal conflict; his journey is one of linear determination with no moments of genuine doubt, struggle, or contradictory impulses that would reveal a deeper character.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated ("morbid curiosity," "trick fear") but feels more like a label than an embodied drive. The character reads as passive, consistently "goaded" or "guided" by the advisor's voice rather than making active choices born from internal conflict. Interiority relies on stock reactions like "I shuddered at the thought" and a "creeping sense of dread," which summarize emotion rather than dramatizing a unique psychological state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prophet's motivation is clearly stated ("to turn obstacles into instruments") and her actions are consistent with it. However, her characterization lacks depth; she functions more as an archetypal conduit for an aesthetic experience than a person with internal contradictions or flaws. The interiority describes her process rather than a conflict of impulses, making her feel somewhat flat despite the lyrical context.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively captured by the recurring "quietly driven" attribute. However, her internal state is conveyed through somewhat generic embodiments of emotion ("shiver run down her spine," "chill down her spine," "dread wash over her"), which feel more like labels than specific, character-particular interiority. The motivation works, but the emotional texture could be richer and less reliant on stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization is superficial and declarative. Emilia is defined by labels like "emotionally rational" and "fierce determination" rather than through demonstrated choices under pressure. Her interiority consists of summarized thoughts and labeled emotions ("a sense of satisfaction"), lacking the contradiction or specificity of a compelling character. She functions as a simple vehicle to advance the plot, without discernible flaws or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    The surveyor's motivation is clear but stated rather than dramatized. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("stoically sensitive," "hushed blaze," "interlaced absence") instead of specific, embodied emotions. The character functions more as a passive lens for the story's themes than an active agent whose choices reveal contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on recurring, abstract labels like "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve." These phrases describe her state rather than embodying it through specific, contradictory impulses in the scene. The change she undergoes is asserted in summary ("she had been changed by her experience") rather than fully earned through a moment of visible struggle or costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaito's motivation to process grief is clear and consistent, but his internal state is often conveyed through declarative labels like "luminous torment" rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The character feels more like a vessel for a theme than a specific individual whose internal conflict drives the action. While his actions (folding, polishing) align with his motives, the interiority lacks the specificity and concrete texture of a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.5)
    Amira's emotional arc is asserted rather than embodied. Her transition from a traumatized survivor to a focused researcher is psychologically abrupt and unconvincing. Emotions are described with diagnostic labels like "frazzled nerves" and "bleak exhilaration," which keeps the reader at a distance and flattens her interiority into a summary of feelings instead of a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lena's motivation is stated but remains abstract, lacking a personal or urgent anchor that would give her choices weight. Her interiority relies on labeling emotions ("thrill of excitement," "sense of trepidation") rather than embodying them through specific thought or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, escalating from unease to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The negotiator's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract, diagnostic labels like "untether the discussions" and "recycle their mistakes into wisdom."

Her competence is established, but the struggle feels summarized rather than embodied in specific, difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    Jack’s motivation is clear, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels and pre-digested epiphanies, such as needing to "realign his heart and actions." This therapy-speak flattens the character, making his emotional journey feel more summarized than experienced. The "merrily melancholic" trait is an interesting contradiction that remains a label, never fully embodied in his on-page actions or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena’s motivation is clear but largely articulated through abstract labels like "weight of her past" and a "desire to kindle empathy."

The final shift to "purpose and direction" feels more like a declared outcome than a change earned through a tangible struggle within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra's motivation to help is based on a single moment of "sensing determination," which feels thin for the personal risk involved. Her core traits, "reluctant" and "paradoxically steady," are stated as labels rather than dramatized through contradictory actions or embodied feeling. The internal conflict is asserted but lacks on-page friction, and her emotional arc resolves into a tidy, diagnostic summary ("not a destruction... but an expansion") that undercuts the terror of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation to understand lost time is clear and consistent. Her interiority is palpable, though it sometimes relies on declarative statements ("she felt an inexplicable connection") rather than fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aurora’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on labels like "steadfast pacifist" and "ghostly resolve" rather than demonstrated choices under pressure. Her internal state is described with stock phrases ("heart was filled with a deep sense of resolve") instead of being embodied, and the "perilous journey" of her shadow work lacks any visible struggle or internal contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's character is built on labels ("destitute philanthropist," "sensitive to subtle nudges") rather than dramatized choices. Her core motivation is passive receptivity, and her skepticism towards the prophecy is mentioned but dissolves without any internal struggle or contradictory action. The transformation feels asserted rather than earned through a difficult, character-revealing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    The sentinel's motivation is clear but shifts too easily. Her transition from "vigilant lock sentinel" to revolutionary happens in a single sentence ("With a surge of determination..."), lacking the internal conflict or contradictory impulses expected of such a profound choice. Her primary trait, "calmly inventive," is demonstrated in the code-breaking but her interiority remains summarized, relying on labels like "pride and belonging" rather than embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.5)
    The herder is more of an archetypal vessel than a character with distinct interiority. Motivation is clear but external ("a lingering promise"). Emotions are labeled ("reverent," "trepidation and awe") rather than embodied, and the "precognitively cursed nature" acts as a recurring label that "stirs" without demonstrating any specific, contradictory impulse or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("cartography of scars," "topography of her own heart") rather than concrete, embodied emotion. The characterization is functional but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aurélien’s motivation to "turn questions into destinations" remains an abstract statement rather than a dramatized, contradictory internal state. The character reads as a collection of intriguing concepts (mechanical arm, dueling philosopher) whose actions are consistent, but his interiority lacks the specific, embodied emotion of a person under pressure. The final epiphany feels more like an intellectual summary than an earned, visceral change.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The poet’s core motivation is clear, but the characterization relies on a collection of evocative labels ("vagrant penny poet," "molting personalities") rather than deeply integrated traits. The "molting personalities" concept, in particular, is an extraneous detail that has no bearing on the on-page choices or internal conflict. The emotional shift from contemplation to action is legible but lacks the friction of a more complex or contradictory interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pianist's motivation to overcome sorrow is clear, but her transformation feels more asserted than earned. The shift from wistful lament to "steely longing" is abrupt, hinging on the magical refuge rather than a deeply embodied internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict—the "luminous doubt"—is more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.5)

However, the interiority relies heavily on labeling emotions ("weight of regret," "sense of peace") rather than embodying them through contradictory impulses in the moment. The emotional progression feels more summarized than dramatized, especially the line "Kaito felt his emotions begin to untangle," which tells instead of shows the process.

Interiority relies on stock phrasing like "inexplicable sense" and unearned epiphanies, lacking embodied emotions or micro-choices under pressure. The old woman's brief appearance adds little relational crucible, and Aria's final transformation reads as abstract summary without visible cost. This vagueness peaks in the ending realization, diluting character specificity.

The single-POV focus shows consistent traits through choices, yet lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchies under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet's motivation to understand her scars is clear and intensifies through reflective choices, with embodied emotions like furious tranquility showing contradictory impulses in her stillness amid the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aurélien's motivation to duel and philosophize is clear and rooted in traits like his diplomatically fierce demeanor, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like pondering questions into destinations without embodied contradictions under pressure. The mechanical arm enables precise actions in the duel, revealing character through movement, yet relationships are underdeveloped as the opponent remains a cipher without crucible pressure. Flaws complicate choices minimally, with the ending's endurance feeling earned but lacking a visible hierarchy of values with cost in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation to forge beauty from anarchy is clear and rooted in traits like monthly personality molts, but interiority relies on stock phrasing without embodied contradictions or simultaneous impulses; the friendship reflection anchors purpose but doesn't force on-page micro-choices under pressure, as seen in the unchallenged shift to rebuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pianist's motivation rooted in lost love is clear and intensifies through her music and film immersion, leading to an earned shift to steely longing; interiority is concrete with embodied sorrow in the melancholy serenade, but emotions lean toward stock melancholy without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of pain feels credible with felt cost, as seen when she steps back into the arbor with a wistful smile, foreclosing endless lament. Relationships are absent, so no crucible pressure applies.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's motivation to protect memories is clear and rooted in her whimsical traits, but interiority relies on summary labels like "luminous doubt" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure.

The planting of the seed reveals character but lacks intensification to compel higher-stakes actions.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaito's motivation to diffuse sorrow is clear and rooted in regret, with embodied emotions shown through his lace-weaving and release of the compass, revealing contradictory impulses in his acceptance of cerulean regret.

    Interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract self-diagnosis ("weight of honesty," "freed by honesty") rather than embodied contradiction. The registrar’s single micro-choice—raising the lens—comes late and feels more symbolic than causally compelled. No visible cost is attached to her final stance, so the change reads as attitudinal rather than path-closing.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dresser’s devotion and the marbles-as-memory device are evocative, but interiority stays summary-level; no moment shows contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rachel’s interiority is vivid—her urge to “unravel the code” is embodied in micro-choices like tilting the program to let water reveal images.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The boy’s motivation to “thread the labyrinth with his own story” is stated but never dramatized; no micro-choice under pressure shows how this desire alters tactics or exacts cost.

    Lena’s curiosity vs. certainty is embodied in tactile choices—angling mirrors, humming to pigments—yet interiority drifts toward lyric abstraction (“bewitch the very fabric of reality”) that blurs contradictory impulses.

    Emilia’s interiority is vivid—her meticulous paper-trail habit and dust-mote ritual are embodied and specific—but the “reinvented past” remains abstract, never crystallizing into a single, costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)

The exile backstory is summary, not crucible. The earned stillness at the end carries felt cost, yet the obsidian grace is more label than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.7)
    Interiority is present but abstract (“felt a sense of peace,” “sense of wonder”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses in scene; choices are generalized (“she knew she had to…”) without visible micro-cost. Character functions more as observing consciousness than agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s interiority is rich and embodied (“eyes… seemed to hold a world of pain”), but his decisive turn—deciding to “translate pain into a universal language”—is stated rather than dramatized through a micro-choice. The porcelain box functions as a mirror of his soul, yet its handling never forces a costly action; the final stance crystallizes without visible forfeiture. Reflection dominates over present-moment pressure, softening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s interiority is consistent—“logical dreamer” and “lucidly watchful” recur—but her choices remain observational; no contradictory impulse or visible cost alters her stance. The final smile feels unearned because the vision changes nothing she risks or forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    The cartographer’s curiosity is stated but never tested by a concrete dilemma; interiority drifts into abstract “legacy” without embodied contradiction. No micro-choice alters tactics; the ending is acceptance, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The painter’s motivation—to coax mirrors into revealing futures—is stated early and reiterated, but her interiority remains abstract (“perceptively calm demeanor,” “borrowed heartbeat”) rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s interiority is present but generalized; “red-rimmed eyes” and “flawed beauty” are labels rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized—negotiations open because delegates “began to open up,” not via Elian’s active tactic. The ending’s “measure of peace” is asserted, not earned by a visible renunciation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interior monologue is vivid (“fractured grace”) and her suppressed sentimentality shapes the final beat of endurance; yet her amorality is asserted more than dramatized, and an abstract label (“amoral philanthropist”) dilutes specificity at the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “weight of expectation” and “lullaby of conformity” are told, not embodied. The bodily poetic form is asserted, not dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Amaranth's desire to challenge narrative ethics remains abstract; no concrete beat shows the cost of that desire on her choices. Interiority is more mood than contradiction; the puppet-show experiments are reported, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her “deep desire” is stated rather than embodied in contradiction. The moth-wing moment hints at motive but never forces a costly choice—she simply knots, builds, and leaves. No internal conflict is dramatized in scene; the final resolve feels foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Akira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers moved deftly,” “heart filled with peace”), but the trait “technically gentle” is asserted rather than tested; no moment shows its cost or contradiction. The forgiveness backstory is summarized, not dramatized, so the emotional pivot feels pre-granted. Closure is earned—she preserves the names and accepts solitude—yet the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Hindsight’s paradoxical gift is stated but never embodied in a concrete choice; interiority drifts into abstract “decaying directive” talk rather than felt contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“empirically ironic nature – a blend of skepticism and wonder”) and embodied emotion surfaces in the tremor when the tile’s glow merges with starlight. Yet the astronomer’s contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) are asserted more than dramatized in scene; no single micro-choice under pressure crystallizes the cost until the final beat, which softens the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s pacifist scheming is asserted rather than dramatized; her “subtle spell of persuasion” lacks visible micro-choices or contradiction under pressure, so motivation reads abstract. Interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“shifting grace…dynamic…release”) instead of embodied conflict. The final smile registers as performance, not earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear (capture the dream), but interiority stays abstract—“felt firmly grounded” is label, not embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure; the mirror simply completes. Endurance/renunciation is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her muttering to trees, tying the ribbon—but the breach-of-contract backstory is delivered in a single expository block that never tilts her present tactics, so the “deciduous vows” remain thematic rather than lived contradiction. Aria’s return is sketched rather than dramatized, muting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Curator’s interiority is vivid (“brightened disquiet”) and embodied, but the final epiphany feels slightly pre-packaged rather than wrested from struggle; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motives are declared—new knowledge and ego—but rarely pressurised by the story; she remains a seeker rather than a chooser. Traits stay external labels (“carefully resourceful”) until the one off-screen renegotiation; no visible flaw or mistake compounds stakes. The final insight (“seeker and guardian”) is stated, not earned through dramatized sacrifice or enduring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra’s motivation to find the Garden is stated early and her “blissfully aberrant” gift is shown guiding her pattern-seeking, but interiority drifts into summary (“she felt a thrill,” “she knew”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final peace arrives without a visible renunciation or cost that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Emilia’s curiosity and drive to “translate confusion into clarity” are stated repeatedly but never tested against a contradictory impulse; she simply complies with the professor’s plan.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is embodied and consistent; the mapkeeper’s tactile engagement with the echo chamber stone and ice cracks shows micro-choices under pressure. Motivation (“find the quiet in the storm”) is clear and intensifies, culminating in earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and the energy beings remain abstract, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; the custodian’s “desire to prove coincidences have meaning” is asserted, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s interiority is specific (“ambient awareness that guided her design process”), but her choices remain observational until the closing minutes, muting internal contradiction and micro­-choice under pressure; the Charged Poise lands but cost is inferred rather than dramatized on the page, so full 8.8 gate miss.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Chronicler’s warmly observant stance is embodied but internal conflicts stay diffuse; the jade cicada motivates reflection yet no decisive action alters the stakes for the figures she watches.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s claustrophobia and desire to taste silences are clearly rooted, but the interiority drifts toward lyrical summary (“flavors of silence began to sprout”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final peace feels more declared than earned by micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s curiosity and determination are clear, but her interiority is generic (“her heart quickened,” “renewed determination”) rather than embodied or contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is embodied (“melancholy mood,” “heart ached”) and the contradictory impulse—yearning to reconnect yet fearing the cost—drives the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyra’s survivor backstory is stated but never dramatized; her “virtuously mischievous” trait is asserted rather than embodied in choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dynasty ender’s interiority is rich and embodied (“ink-stained fingers,” “reverent touch”), but the decisive turn—accepting that their dynasty ends—arrives as an abstract epiphany rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the character simply receives visions passively.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The knight’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; “shivering bliss” and “sense of purpose” are labels rather than embodied contradictions.

Withdrawn nature dissolves too easily—no visible struggle or flaw that complicates the final embrace of possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Emilia’s interiority is textured and consistent, but her choices remain observational; the decisive shift to “guardian of memories” is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the emotional arc is summary-led.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Aria’s motivation is stated (resist erasure) but never embodied in a concrete micro-choice; the phone key is clutched but never used or risked, so no contradictory impulse or visible cost emerges. Interiority drifts into summary (“she felt the weight of her mission”) rather than specific perception under pressure. The final “smile” and “vanish” gesture lack earned cost; the story tells us she “held the line” without dramatizing what that costs her now.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear—she plays to neutralize the prophecy—but interiority stays abstract (“quietly vivid intensity” repeats without embodiment). No contradictory impulse surfaces; the music simply succeeds. The final smile and disappearance feel unearned because no flaw or cost is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    The seed sorter’s curiosity and decision to prod the speck catalyze the plot, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion remain lyric-safe rather than visceral; the arc from observer to interpreter is clear yet predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s interiority is tactile and embodied (“worn and weathered hands”), but the shift from passive tinkerer to active navigator is asserted rather than dramatized; the compass rose guides his hands without visible internal contradiction or cost, so the final stance feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the shift from disillusionment to purposeful experimentation is more summarized than dramatized; the “luminous regret” refrain edges toward label-speak. Micro-choices (handling the coin, setting up the new experiment) are present yet feel low-stakes because no concrete risk or cost is attached. The arc of self-redemption is coherent, but the final beat of “peace” arrives without a visible forfeiture that would make the change costly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The collector’s motivation to “integrate laughter into healing” is stated but never embodied in a choice; her actions remain purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s trauma responses and proprioceptive enhancements are named but never embodied in a choice that costs her; the “mathematics of mercy” remains an abstract label rather than a felt dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract “urge” and “purpose” rather than embodied contradiction; the moment she decides to “unfasten the anchors” lacks a visible, specific cost on the page, so the final stance feels announced rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ezra’s contradictory motive—repairing elevators while drawn by ghosts—is credibly embodied in her tactile handling of dust and barrel; final “weightless burden” earns the renunciation because her micro-choice to keep the logbook and mainspring forecloses another entry to this office. One slip: “gentle curves of metal” drifts toward catalog prose rather than embodied need.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.4)
    The operator is sketched as a mythic archetype rather than a person: “mystery,” “quiet reverence,” “deep understanding” are labels, not interiority. No contradictory impulses or micro-choices appear on the page; the release of the whisper is reported, not dramatized. The final stance (compressing eternity) is asserted rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“burnished sorrow”); contradictory impulses surface in the tension between revolutionary past and poetic present. Micro-choices (picking up shard, covering mirrors) reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of active revolution for chronicler role is earned, though the cost feels more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Erebus’s desire to restore balance is stated but never tested; he never chooses between competing values or suffers visible cost. Interiority is atmospheric (“coax music from the most lifeless of boxes”) rather than embodied under pressure. The single on-page character remains consistent, yet no contradictory impulse or micro-choice alters his trajectory. Closure is gentle stasis, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lush but abstract; the collector’s “inexplicable connection” and “quest” remain vague, so the final surrender feels pre-ordained rather than earned through visible contradiction or cost. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized—she simply follows the compass and dissolves into unity. Eccentricity is asserted, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Aria’s craving for pattern and connection is palpable, but her interiority leans toward summary rather than contradiction in the moment; the sculpture choice at the end feels more capstone than crucible because the prior beats are almost ruminative.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.7)
    Luna’s quest is driven and consistent, but her interiority trades in gentle abstractions—“umbral tenderness,” “reckon the mysteries”—rather than sharp contradictory impulses acted out in scene. The final understanding is declared rather than dramatized; we see only soft awe, no irrevocable choice or forfeited alternative. This flattens the arc: the cost is felt generically, never specifically on Luna’s body, social ties, or artistic freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Naomi’s curiosity is palpable, but her choices remain largely observational; the parley with Ada is the single active beat.

The ending’s sense of purpose feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Alchemist’s interiority is vivid (“mind consumed,” “fierce intensity”), yet choices remain abstract—“conceive a plan,” “begin to work”—without a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scribe’s motivation—to archive emotional patterns—is stated but never tested or complicated; interiority drifts into lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice alters tactics; the “accidental prophecy” happens to the scribe, not through a decision that costs anything. The field-trip memory surfaces but does not force a present-tense trade-off, so character change remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; “furiously tranquil” never manifests as embodied contradiction. The seed saver’s final insight—passing the burden on—reads as authorial gloss rather than earned character logic. No micro-choice under pressure anchors the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)

    Interiority is textured and embodied ("red-rimmed eyes," "trembling hand"), but the recluse’s contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to close the box feels inevitable rather than wrested from competing desires. Motivation is clear and sustained, yet lacks a visible cost that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    The caretaker’s “brazen calm” is stated but never embodied in a moment of visible contradiction; interiority remains generic (“they knew,” “they believed”).

Closure is a peaceful acceptance rather than an earned renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.1)
    Coachman’s interiority never rises above lyrical shorthand; bird translation is tell-only, lacks concrete choice; seed-sac cliché repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s embodied memories and twitching nose give interior texture, and Lyra’s riddle-solving beat lands with concrete agency, yet their partnership stays largely symbolic—final image shows belonging but without contradictions actively costing either character.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s interiority is vivid—her disconnection embodied in the “weight of her temporally stretched existence”—but the shift from confusion to resolve is more declared than dramatized; the final step forward feels lightly earned because the prior beats lean on lyrical summary rather than micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Moonwhisper’s interiority is consistent—curious, playful, dutiful—but never contradictory; no moment of simultaneous impulse. The pocket sundial is handled, yet its meaning is ornamental. The “sacredly playful” trait is asserted, not enacted under pressure. Closure is a success without visible cost, so no earned stasis or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract; the crisis actor’s “benevolently ruthless” trait is asserted rather than embodied in choice. The survivor’s shift from passivity to seeing “opportunities” is too compressed to feel earned. Relationships remain symbolic rather than crucibles of pressure.

    The seer’s interiority is evocative but abstract; motives (“to understand the shape of home”) are stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. The moment of touching the stone is vivid, yet the decision to “seed a new reality” arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Flaws and limits remain undramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)

    Interiority is lyrical but generic; the artist’s “defiance” and “mischievous glint” never translate into a concrete micro-choice that alters her path. The final “peace” feels asserted rather than earned by prior embodied struggle. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelin’s desperation and kintsugi ethos are embodied in her breath-hold micro-choices, but interiority drifts into summary (“her mind wandered back…”) rather than simultaneous contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “intimately aloof” is asserted rather than embodied in a single decisive choice. The promise to herself remains a told motivation; no micro-choice under pressure shows the cost of keeping it.

    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but his contradictory impulses remain abstract; the “purifying” belief is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels diffuse rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is evocative (“raw solace,” “open wound”) yet drifts toward summary; the censer foot and moon-phase trait are introduced early but never alter a present choice, so the final acceptance feels more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the truthful compulsion is dramatized through micro-choices like the stomach lurch when handling the eye. The final resolve is earned by prior causality, though the “psychological safety” motive is more asserted than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael’s interiority is abstracted; no contradictory impulse ever collides with an embodied choice. The one discernible action (lifting the wilted boutonnière) is reactive and carries no visible cost. His final “burden” is delivered in expository summary, undermining earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Emilia’s grief-driven vow is clear, but interiority drifts into summary (“thoughts turn,” “felt the weight lifting”) rather than embodied contradiction.

The final note from her father lands as external validation rather than earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid (“sense of lacy menace”), but her contradictory impulses are summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final step into the grotto feels inevitable yet the cost is only asserted, not embodied. Companion remains a cipher, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist’s curiosity is palpable, but her interiority drifts into generic wonder (“a sense of connection,” “scientifically romantic intensity”) rather than concrete contradiction or cost.

Secondary characters are atmospheric only.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)

Final renunciation of pain is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)

No contradictory impulse is enacted in scene; the “trembling calm” is asserted, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs her anything. The result is a static meditation rather than a character-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaito’s interiority remains consistent, with the crow-quill obsession supplying motive and embodied tension. The renunciation of past scars anchors the final image; however, his dialogue-free monologue leans slighty authorial rather than strictly character-voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her reverence and desperation are embodied in the way she fingers the embossed spines—but the estranged friend Astra never appears, so the relationship crucible is theoretical.

    Lena’s interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“physics of letting go”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values. The laser pointer and mushrooms never force a decision that costs her anything visible. Closure is a declared epiphany rather than an earned renunciation or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but her “theoretically rebellious” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page contradiction or micro-choice shows it constraining her tactics.

    Raven’s loneliness is stated but never embodied; the moon-rock fragment is a prop, not a crucible. The “desperately jocular” mask is asserted, not dramatized, so the final lifting of loneliness feels unearned. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—skin drinking scent, tattoos shifting—but motivation (“navigate uncharted emotional depths”) is asserted rather than dramatized until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s interiority is vivid—“confidently uncertain” is dramatized in her micro-choice to unbend the nib—but the weeds’ failure never loops back to complicate her later tactics, so the flaw feels ornamental rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The advisor’s interiority is abstract (“map of emotions,” “deep understanding”) rather than embodied; the old man’s signing supplies the only concrete micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s obsession and promise are stated, but interior contradiction is thin; the “volcanic tenderness” is asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aria’s quiet rebellion is stated but never tested against external pressure; her interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“auroral sorrow”) rather than embodied contradiction. The shared-dream motive is declared early yet never collides with a tangible obstacle, so the final peace feels pre-approved. No micro-choice visibly forecloses a path; the story ends in stasis rather than earned renunciation.

    Interiority is present but generic (“thrill of excitement,” “sense of satisfaction”) rather than embodied contradiction; the worker’s expertise in reading tracks is asserted but never tested under pressure. Motivation to prove whispers > shouts is stated early yet does not visibly shape micro-choices; the final whispered encounter feels coincidental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    Guardian’s interiority is diffuse; “teach darkness the value of stars” remains an abstract label never embodied in a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elian’s interiority drifts between generic mystic coach and cipher; no embodied contradiction surfaces until the final paragraph, and even then it’s summary.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“deep shade of indigo… thousand unspoken stories”), but her contradictory impulses remain stated rather than dramatized in scene; the detachment from past burdens is asserted rather than shown through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Echo’s blank mask and contradictory interiority are embodied through the compulsive whittling and narrated monologues; the final stillness shows a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is concrete (“glimmer of hope” inside “deep sadness”) without therapy-speak. The moral ambiguity is dramatized: Echo’s art both salves and traps them. Micro-choices (placing the bouquet, voice falling silent) foreclose the path of endless narration.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is lush but abstract; the “tremor of certainty” is asserted rather than embodied in a concrete micro-choice.

The glassblower remains a functional mirror rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation (“teach withering to bloom”) is declared early and recurs, but interiority drifts into abstract lyricism rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels lightly earned rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s “closure seeker who opens wounds” trait is stated repeatedly but never dramatized in a concrete choice; interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“a reminder of the wound they had reopened”).

Closure is an unearned arrival rather than a character-driven transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.7)
    The bellhop’s interiority is evocative but static; the “unpardonable silence” is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The single on-page choice—continuing to stand watch—does not visibly foreclose a path or incur new cost, so the arc feels circular rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the artist’s contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is felt more in mood than in concrete forfeiture. No secondary character pressure to test status or relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—eyes “unsettling pale blue,” hair “consciously wild”—but the final epiphany is delivered as summary rather than embodied choice, muting the cost.

The filial tension with the bounty-hunter father is off-stage; the sword is hung on the wall but never tests her. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“sense of purpose,” “engraved quiet”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure is a passive drift into sleep, not a renunciation that costs her anything visible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.3)

    Adelaide’s desire to “discover hidden truths” is declared repeatedly but never dramatized through a concrete micro-choice; the pen nib is handled, yet its emotional charge is asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract therapy-speak (“dissonance of old guilt”) and lacks a single embodied micro-choice that alters tactics; the guilt remains more label than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority is evocative but largely abstract (“brittle awakenings,” “sense of purpose”); no contradictory impulses appear in-scene.  The character’s choices after the memory remain internal summarization—no on-page micro-choice shows she alters behavior today because of it.  Reincarnation memory functions more as backdrop than active driver for present-tense motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid—her wonder at the lotus temple and the twig’s spiral feels embodied—but her arc from passive observer to active contributor is under-motivated; the decision to weave the twig into the installation appears as whimsical impulse rather than earned necessity, so the final “thread” insight reads lightly rather than as costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)

Interiority is textured but drifts into therapeutic phrasing (“awaken dormant empathy,” “lance the boil of her own emotional numbness”) instead of dramatized contradiction under pressure. Micro-choice is deferred; once the detective speaks, events flatten to observation. No palpable cost is registered in scene before the closing tableau—the handshake of recognition is graceful but untested.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Emilia’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; the “nervously confident” label is repeated without embodied contradiction.

    The librarian’s moon-phase mood shifts and titan-gear biology are evocative, but the piece never dramatizes a single, high-stakes choice; interiority stays reflective, not pressured.

    Kaito’s contradictory impulses (clone guilt vs. self-reclamation) are named but never embodied in a risky on-the-page action; the meditation stance reads identical at the end as the start, so the “change” is rhetorical not tactile.

Only the brain jar moment flashes interior contradiction, yet no consequential micro-choice follows.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is evocative but drifts into summary (“her mind began to flow with theories”) rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s interiority is warm and embodied—her humming and hand-holding feel lived—but the “decisively kind” trait is asserted rather than tested under pressure, and Emma remains a gentle cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s longing to restore communal ritual is clear, but her interiority stays lyrical and abstract; the vine’s pulse never forces a micro-choice that costs her anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—hands chiseling while “turmoil within” pulses—but the shift from grief to insight is narrated rather than dramatized; the mentor’s spectral nod is the only external pressure, so the final “shape of collective grief” feels more declared than earned.

    Aria’s memory-tasting gift and gentle-rebel stance are clearly motivated, yet interior depth stays mostly summary: “flavors of joy, sorrow, longing danced on her palate” tells rather than dramatizes contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
