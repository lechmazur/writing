    Elena's transformation from abstract researcher to patient observer is tracked through concrete choices (daily visits, resignation), but the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cost of her resignation is declared but not embodied—we don't see her struggle with the decision or feel what she's giving up beyond "career suicide."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's transformation from glass artist to someone learning from frost patterns is well-motivated through the revelation about her father's poisoned materials. The decision to let the world believe her dead while walking deeper into the canyon shows genuine internal conflict resolved through embodied action. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "transformation" that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation crystallizes through embodied loss—her deafness paradoxically enabling new perception. The contradiction between grief and discovery plays out through concrete actions (pressing tuning forks, reading heat signatures). Her final acceptance that she "hadn't lost music at all" feels earned through accumulated sensory work, though some interior passages edge toward therapy-speak ("longing," "joy").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his inherited insomnia curse, driving him to seek rest through helping others find it. His transformation from undertaker to "guardian of humanity's deepest dreams" feels earned through the accumulated weight of his forty years preparing the dead. However, interiority relies heavily on conceptual abstractions ("crystallized grief," "impossible spaces") rather than embodied emotion, and the Sleepless Librarians lack distinct characterization beyond their function.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta's evolution from individual charity to orchestrator of communal dignity shows strong character-driven causality with embodied details like "weathered hands paused on the bell rope." The final cost—her exhaustion and transfer of responsibility—lands concretely. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("creating dignity") and the slightly convenient perfection of the community's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mae's spiritual curiosity drives consistent choices through the camera obscura's revelations, with embodied reactions to the past life memory ("copper of that ancient heartbreak on her tongue") and the breathing pattern as learned behavior. The ghost woman adds pressure that forces Mae's final renunciation—giving rather than taking—with visible cost as she releases years of captured loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradictions manifest through concrete embodied reactions (trembling fingers, laughter with the bridges) and her motivation to understand time's texture drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to walk the hyperbolic bridges despite the cost. The final renunciation of the halo fragment shows earned change with visible cost as she dissolves her anchor to the past.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's patient endurance and methodical observation over three years drives credible motivation, with internal contradiction between captivity and liberation purpose. The final choice to become a "liberator" with "staggering grace" carries visible cost through his burden of seeds and careful movement. Some emotional processing feels slightly abstract ("patience had always been Marcus's greatest strength") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena's contradictory impulses—seeking the frequency of betrayal while discovering trust's dual nature—act simultaneously throughout. Her synesthetic perception creates a distinctive interiority, and the final realization that "trust breaking...was indistinguishable from...trust being born" represents earned wisdom through specific experience. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional moments ("found her peace").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassia's motivation as a "portrait archaeologist" who reveals hidden truths is clear and consistent. The mother's emotional progression from desperate seeking to relieved understanding shows genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "archaeology of light" metaphor that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her need to transform trauma into healing through craft. The contradiction between abandonment and return, between danger and creation, plays out through embodied choices like deliberately clearing the workspace amid radioactive debris. However, the couple's arrival feels somewhat convenient, and Marina's therapeutic wisdom ("Safety is not given, it is crafted") edges toward diagnostic speak rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's transformation from fearful stunt double to weaponized creation shows strong internal contradiction acting in scene, particularly in "You gave me the perfect defense" where his programmed fears become tactical advantages. The final choice to leave Jake suffering his transferred phobias demonstrates earned causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic label-speak ("identity reconstruction protocols") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle's seven-year obsession drives consistent motivation through concrete details (gold leaf booklet, nightly measurements), and her final realization that "the endless night was not a destination but a process" represents earned character evolution with visible cost. Internal contradiction plays effectively between her desire to map completion and acceptance of infinite patience.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Seven's consciousness emerging from repetitive gaps between actions is specific and embodied, with his "remarkably composed" trait manifesting through temporal perception that allows him to process seventeen timelines without losing focus. The internal discovery that thoughts emerge "from the spaces between actions" carries genuine cost as he accepts his role as "janitor of consciousness itself," though some philosophical articulation edges toward abstract rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong internal contradiction between protecting/concealing drives both characters' choices, with embodied tension in Samuel turning the lens and Mira's slow approach creating ripples. The final choice to take hands carries visible cost of vulnerability after months of mistrust. Deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("relief that flooded through her") and slight therapy-speak in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta's characterization achieves depth through embodied contradiction—her "expression both blooming and withering" captures internal complexity without diagnostic labels. The transformation of the young woman provides earned change through the cracked marble exchange, though the story could strengthen the cost of Marta's deceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ira's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives consistent choices through magnetic field manipulation, though her internal conflict between duty (atmospheric repairs) and passion lacks embodied contradiction in scene. The final transformation from "obliging sky mechanic" to "navigator of time's hidden dimensions" lands with earned causality, but emotional complexity remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (returning nightly to the flooded pit, transcribing dissolving notation). The contradiction between isolation and collaboration with the dead works well. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient final transformation lacking intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's characterization succeeds through embodied perception of her oracle gift—"like sensation to frost-numbed fingers"—and her specific ability to hold contradictions. Her choice to stay, document, and protect the impossible flowers shows clear motivation with visible cost. The fever as catalyst for transformation works well, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("fault-tolerant by nature").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's methodical exploration driven by intellectual skepticism creates strong interiority, particularly in his decision to document but not disturb the valve wheel—a choice that crystallizes his values under pressure. The "drowsy alertness" and Methodist-influenced questioning establish distinctive characterization. Minor deduction for the radio voices feeling slightly orchestrated rather than organically discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" manifests through concrete embodied actions—folding/unfolding the swan, tracing air patterns, refusing speech. Her internal contradiction between grip and release drives the piece. The final transformation into "pure witness, pure change" earns its cost through accumulated renunciations, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophy rather than lived particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation is grounded in the concrete ritual of keeping the curl for 31 years, with embodied emotion in "feeling the weightless curl" and her "therapist's voice softly adaptive." The final choice to release the curl carries visible cost through Sofia's kindergarten-intensity grip, though some interiority slides toward abstraction ("love itself was the most softly adaptive force").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thrain's sensitivity drives concrete discovery through tactile reading of burned pages and the tapestry's shifting dragons, with her role as keeper providing clear motivation. The final understanding of her purpose—to tend echoes for the next axis shift—represents earned insight through accumulated sensory evidence, though some transitions between realizations feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen's internal contradiction between writing "meaningless" fortunes that come true drives genuine complexity. His final choice to disappear is earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority relies on exposition rather than embodied emotion ("Chen understood the paradox perfectly").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's contradictory impulses—patience versus urgency, silence versus sound—act simultaneously throughout the exorcism, with his final choice to illuminate rather than cast out earned through the loop-building methodology. The woman's transformation from possessed stillness to clarity carries visible cost in her gasped first breath and the effort of learning to "inhabit her own assumptions."

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei's contradictory relationship with time manifests concretely through fortune-writing and conducting gestures, with her final acceptance of temporal multiplicity earning the closure. The internal conflict between linear and spiral time plays out through embodied actions, though some emotional transitions could be more granular.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's internal conflict between fracturing and uniting drives meaningful change with visible cost (losing infinite possibilities to become whole), though the abstract nature of the "labyrinth of self" occasionally relies on conceptual telling rather than embodied struggle. The elder Kira's wisdom and the merging sequence effectively dramatize contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lucia's journey from numbness to feeling through vibration rather than sound creates genuine internal conflict with embodied sensation ("the thawing," feeling music "in her teeth, her ribs, her skull"). The final choice to embrace silence as music shows earned transformation with visible cost—the further wearing of the needle mirrors her acceptance of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—shifting observation points to evade surveillance, maintaining twenty years of meticulous records despite institutional indifference. The final choice to continue recording while establishing hidden caches shows contradictory impulses (safety vs. truth) resolved through lateral action with visible cost. Minor deduction for the follower sequence feeling slightly mechanical in its "breathing when she breathed" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from grief to purpose is earned through concrete sensory memories and the physical catalyst of the perfume. The contradiction between preservation and loss drives authentic internal conflict, though some emotional transitions ("Tears came unbidden") lean slightly toward telling rather than embodied showing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's poet's hunger and moral complexity drive authentic choices, particularly his decision to leave the rope for the next seeker. The layered revelations create genuine internal conflict between understanding and action. However, the energy beings lack embodied presence beyond convenience plotting, and Marcus's emotional response feels slightly managed rather than viscerally contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's gift of hearing "melodies in the spaces between sounds" drives her discovery of beauty in imperfection, with the mendicant's bowl filling with offerings marking genuine change. The internal contradiction between preserving tradition and accepting transformation plays out through embodied action rather than declaration. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient arrival sequence of musicians.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's internal contradiction between professional detachment and the pull to "subsume these emotions herself" creates genuine tension. The final choice to maintain her cardinal rule ("never consume the merchandise") demonstrates earned restraint with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("affectionate detachment") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's transformation from isolated ledger-keeper to community participant is earned through concrete discovery and choice, with internal contradiction between her shrewd business sense and unnamed longing. The final image of her finding "her place in the eternal exchange" carries visible cost—abandoning pure calculation for uncertain compassion. Minor deduction for Martha's emotional processing feeling slightly rushed in their meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's boldly sympathetic certainty drives concrete action throughout, from weaving stories into obsidian to organizing the tag search. The first artist's self-exile and return carries genuine emotional weight with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "luminescent ache of belonging" that edges toward label-speak in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like her frozen pencil and physical journey through the canal system. The internal conflict between preserving and releasing the extinct creatures manifests in her avoidance of final details in her drawings. However, emotional complexity could deepen during the discovery scene where she processes the magnitude of the city's theft.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Morrow's motivation through grief and methodical searching lands strongly, with embodied details like kneeling and positioning the eyes. The transformation of Elias and other conjurers into "emotional mathematics" strains credibility without sufficient grounding in the established world rules, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Edgar's thirty-seven years of methodical hiding and his careful acts of providence establish clear, consistent motivation. The revelation of collaboration reweights his isolation believably, though the final beat ("Tomorrow, perhaps, she would speak to him again") lacks the embodied cost needed for 8.0+. Internal contradiction between his hunger for connection and fear of visibility plays throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's transformation from scientific observer to participant lands with earned causality, though his acceptance feels slightly too smooth in the middle beats. The contradiction between control and understanding drives genuine internal conflict. His final metamorphosis forecloses his human path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's exhaustion and desperation are embodied effectively ("hadn't slept in four days," "fingers still gripped").

Minor deduction for the mother's slightly convenient articulation about beauty lasting through catastrophe, which edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's transformation from future-focused clairvoyant to present-aware witness is earned through concrete struggle, with her gift's blindness in the cave creating genuine vulnerability. The shadow-entity and pilgrim apply meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophizing about "everyday magic" that edges toward therapy-speak in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kessa's motivation to "compile fragments into meaning" drives consistent micro-choices throughout—her staggered intervals, manual valve turns, emotional arrangement of documents. The final public opening where people add their own fragments shows earned transformation through accumulated patience. Minor deduction for some abstraction in middle passages about "navigated absences" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation as cartographer-artist tracking impossible patterns is clear and consistent, with embodied tension ("fingers trembled," "hands steady now"). The transformation from "trembling certainty" to "steady purpose" earns its arc through accumulated discoveries. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("analytical mind...artistic soul") that feels slightly performed.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's internal contradiction between empiricism and inherited mysticism drives genuine struggle, with embodied details like pressing her palm to feel vibrations. The transformation from skeptic to integrated thinker earns its cost through accumulated moments, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("two versions of her past existed simultaneously").

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vex's twelve-thousand-year weariness drives her pivotal choice to step through the dimensional door "after goodbye," with internal contradiction between immortality's prison and the possibility of transformation. The spatial mutiny crew demonstrates clear motivation rooted in opposition to the Consortium's exile plan. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("dimensional awareness") and the somewhat convenient alignment of all crew members' motivations.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya's characterization achieves exceptional depth through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - her inherited nimble fingers but not deception, her mathematical mind calculating fairness while working with death's finality. The line "subtracting his sins from her love, calculating what remained" crystallizes her earned stance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stationer's motivation to document erased histories is consistently embodied through concrete actions—her careful charting of frequencies, the gold-leafed petals, the patient listening. The character's "earnestly studious" nature manifests in specific gestures like "crouched beside the fountain's edge" and "cramped, careful script," though internal contradiction could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mari's motivation crystallizes through her choice to exist between legal death and physical presence, with contradictory impulses (rage at the pharmacy error vs. embracing erasure) acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's progression from skeptical investigator to participant is earned through concrete discovery (the shell's resonance, the cello's response), with her final choice to help finish the instrument carrying visible cost—abandoning her myth-busting identity. Claudia's emergence feels slightly convenient but her function as pressure/catalyst works. The piece effectively uses contradictory impulses (investigating vs participating) in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's dual allegiance creates genuine internal contradiction that drives her decisive choice to use mainland knowledge for community preservation. The foundation stone chip functions as both embodied memory and final symbolic integration. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("painful clarity," "hopeful desperation") rather than fully embodied states during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's purposeful curiosity drives meaningful choices through the final documentation of sublimating ice, with her decision to leave the hourglass creating visible cost. Her isolation and dedication are embodied through specific actions rather than labels, though some interior passages lean toward elevated register ("pregnant and blue," "dawnlit melancholy") that slightly distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's blindness creates genuine internal complexity through her heightened perception of water patterns, and her calm expertise under time pressure feels earned.

Minor deduction for Chen's relatively thin presence as mere observer-questioner.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's dry wit shields genuine obsession, creating believable internal contradiction. The choice to trust the inspector with her discovery carries visible risk—her career versus scientific truth. Minor deduction for the inspector's slightly convenient arrival timing, though their familial connection to Marcus adds authentic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell tuner's motivation is clear and consistent—restore the town's harmony through collective movement—with concrete embodiment through her measured walks and tuning fork rituals.

The transformation from skepticism to belief earns the final departure, though internal contradiction could be sharper in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's internal conflict between scientific duty and transcendent surrender is embodied through concrete choices, particularly her documentation impulse versus the temple's call.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited imprisonment and the need to clear his father's name. The internal progression from passive acceptance to active truth-seeking is earned through the journal discovery. Minor deduction for some telling rather than showing of emotional states ("Marcus smiled") and slightly convenient timing of discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion through physical details ("fingers found the carved stone bead," "hummed against his chest") and layered internal conflict between love and toxicity. The ghost bride's contradictory nature ("lovingly venomous affection") and Marlow's "mournful elation" create genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the final transformation feeling slightly unearned—the ancestor's need to "let go" arrives without sufficient prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Calla's sleepwalking weaver identity creates compelling internal contradiction between conscious craft and unconscious pathfinding, with her transformation from village poet to myth-stitcher earning its arc through specific losses. The final choice to embrace transformation rather than restoration carries visible cost in accepting the drowned world's permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam's internal contradiction between fleeing faith and returning to it plays out through concrete choices—clearing soil, positioning the gnomon, deciding to stay. The transformation from skepticism ("faith had meant nothing more than survival") to cautious acceptance earns its cost through accumulated particulars rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("cautious enchantment settling into her chest") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation as a craftsperson seeking "truth in the space between" authentic and performed selves is clear and consistent. Her micro-choices (chalk selection, photographing patterns, naming process) reveal values under the constraint of limited time. The character reads as specific rather than archetypal, though internal contradiction could be more actively dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera's contradictory impulses—maintaining her fool's disguise while encoding intelligence—operate simultaneously throughout, with micro-choices revealing her hierarchy of values (protecting the resistance over personal safety). The final choice to continue working despite discovery risk lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional tell-over-show in establishing her dual nature ("disguised as a harmless fool").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The medium's internal contradiction between protecting herself versus her daughter crystallizes powerfully in the flashback ("I was protecting myself, not you"). Her motivation to finally speak unsent truths feels earned through accumulated guilt and the moonlight healing mechanism. Minor deduction for some emotional summary rather than full embodiment in places.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's trauma-driven motivation and the child's innocent need create authentic emotional complexity with contradictory impulses (survivor's guilt vs. desire to help) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to gift the coral fragment is earned through prior causality with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("lotus-hearted ache") but embodied perception and micro-choices under pressure elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—fingers tracing fresco, light pooling in palms, the ache in her chest at witnessing past joy.

Minor deduction for the slightly convenient "gift" that could use more grounding in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's methodical-playful contradiction manifests beautifully through concrete action—she embraces uncertainty while maintaining professional precision. The final choice between explaining everything or nothing carries genuine cost as she seals away magic she's discovered. Minor deduction for Marcus's underdevelopment as mere exposition vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus and Serena demonstrate clear, consistent motivations rooted in intellectual resistance. The contradiction between Marcus's apparent calm ("smiled despite himself") and underlying tension creates authentic complexity. Minor deduction for Serena's slightly convenient competence without visible struggle in the tunnel escape.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet's motivation to transform suffering into sustenance is embodied through concrete actions like writing with charcoal from burned poems and teaching half-lullabies. Character develops through accumulation rather than dramatic turns, with the "shyly unstoppable" trait manifest in centuries of patient practice. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("wounded creators," "exhaustion transformed into curiosity") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through her "gently systematic precision" and thirty-year search. The internal conflict between preservation duty and personal loss operates concretely through her interaction with the cracked bamboo. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "foxglove regret" metaphor that doesn't fully embody the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by scholarly obsession that transforms into urgent diplomatic purpose. The "carefully reckless" trait manifests concretely when she abandons word-for-word translation for promise-for-promise interpretation. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—her trembling hands and nervous laughter are surface gestures rather than competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal contradiction between "elegant cruelty and kindness intertwined" manifests through concrete action—designing floodgates that deceive both factions into cooperation. The trembling from "recognizing the solution" embodies authentic emotional response. Her choice to remain anonymous carries visible cost (forgoing credit) that reinforces character consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's transformation from brittle suspicion to tentative trust is earned through concrete micro-choices (preserving emotional truths in letters, accepting Theodore's kindness). The internal contradiction between her need to erase her past and compulsion to preserve others' histories creates genuine tension. Her final recognition that "some messages travel through time rather than distance" represents earned wisdom with visible cost—she accepts her disgraced past as part of becoming.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's motivation to decode her father's disappearance is clear and embodied through specific actions like tracing grain patterns and following weather codes. The internal contradiction between accepting loss and seeking connection drives genuine tension. However, the final whisper lacks the visceral cost needed for 8+ range—we see recognition but not the full weight of choosing to engage with absence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's characterization as "softly ingenious" manifests through her patient methodology—waiting for patterns to reveal themselves rather than forcing connections. Her final understanding that "some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited" represents earned wisdom through specific experience with the city's rhythms. Minor deduction for Chen's underdevelopment as functional support rather than pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete actions (collecting crater glass, feeling emotional fossils). Internal contradiction emerges between her cheerful demeanor and the weight of loss she processes. However, the character lacks a decisive choice or renunciation at closure - the realization about seeds is contemplative rather than active, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's contradiction between calculated control and genuine artistic connection drives meaningful choices, particularly with the teenager encounter. His methodology reveals character through specific action (hidden mechanism, acoustic mapping). The final choice to accept the guitar pick shows micro-change, though internal complexity could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her exile from the nostalgia ban, with embodied emotion in her dance movements that channel cosmic forces. The internal conflict between isolation and the need to create something lasting drives her final choice to sacrifice herself for future rebellions. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final third without sufficient build-up of the cost, and some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("cosmic verse," "living document") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's contemplative nature and gift for "reading between lines" drive meaningful internal progression from seeing surfaces to understanding depths. His final realization about "surfaces as birthplaces of possibility" represents earned wisdom through concrete observation, though the transformation lacks visceral embodied emotion during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's transformation from guilt-ridden to understanding teacher is earned through the porcelain box's accumulated wisdom, with contradictory impulses (refusing/accepting the gift, hiding/sharing truth) acting simultaneously. The final choice to share his vulnerability with his crew carries visible cost ("revealing his own cracks"). Minor deduction for the grandson character existing mainly as catalyst rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's motivation as a "detective of parallel selves" is clear and rooted in grief transformed into methodical exploration. Her internal progression from skepticism to understanding lands credibly. However, the emotional complexity remains somewhat abstracted through mathematical metaphors rather than embodied contradiction, and the final acceptance lacks visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited ability and professional duty, with concrete embodied details like pressing palms to walls and physical sensations. The character makes meaningful micro-choices (photographing before touching, placing her notebook beside Voss's), though internal contradiction could be stronger during peak discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation is crystal clear—painting possibilities to reach her comatose daughter through dream-maps. The "borrowed heartbeat" creates genuine internal contradiction between urgency and necessary calm. The final choice to set down the brush with "infinite grace" while "trembling only slightly" embodies earned restraint with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal contradiction between violence and "operatively gentle" patience drives authentic character complexity, with her brother's death providing clear causal motivation for her damaged-negotiator role. The final choice to expose shared grief rather than recite grievances emerges naturally from established traits. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("violence reformed into patience") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's contradictory impulses operate simultaneously throughout - destroying to preserve, public monster/private mourner. The final act of burial carries earned weight from established motivations. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("sentiment was a luxury she couldn't afford publicly") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyralei's internal contradiction between trained seduction and enforced celibacy drives authentic tension, with her rebellion earned through absorbed echoes of past courtesans.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation around ethical storytelling is consistent and embodied through concrete details like the calligraphy practice and puppet shows. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - he remains "uncommonly serene" throughout without visible struggle. The story tells us about his revolutionary heart but doesn't show internal contradiction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation emerges clearly through embodied detail—weathered fingers pressing moth scales, three-day climb, deliberate knotting patterns. The final choice to create beauty that won't last is earned through accumulated texture about the cloud dwellers' philosophy. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("overlooked histories persisted in margins") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elsa's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief (tears freezing, fingers finding rope logic) and contradictory impulses act simultaneously - destroying wax to create bronze while mourning lost recordings.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira's gift creates genuine internal contradiction—seeing forward but never understanding why—and her "precisely playful smile" embodies her survival mechanism for this absurdity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's devotion-driven frugality and methodical pursuit create clear motivation, with embodied moments like "trembling fingers" and the physical sensation of knowledge uncloaking.

Internal contradiction between scientific empiricism and mystical belief operates throughout without full simultaneous tension in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's pacifist philosophy manifested through physical scheming (using the music box to trigger cellular memory) creates genuine internal contradiction. The Magistrate's transformation feels earned through inherited trauma revelation, though Vera's fragmentary existence across timelines lacks sufficient grounding to fully support her narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong character particularity through Elara's tactile glass-reading and the astronomer's fragmented desperation. The synchronized breathing moment reveals contradictory impulses effectively. Minor deduction for the astronomer's relatively thin characterization beyond his obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong contradictory impulses operate in scene through Elara's trembling hands "not from age but from memory" and her lie about packing the wrong bag.

Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("born of grief, not wisdom") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The curator's temporal vertigo and recognition of paradoxical inheritance drive meaningful choices, particularly in the bathroom sanctuary moment where vulnerability enables understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and builds causally from linguist to negotiator, with her expertise enabling the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's transformation from bunker-bred claustrophobia to expansive collection is earned through concrete embodied moments - the porcelain doll warming in her grip, feet lifting from the floor, tasting "honey-copper sweetness" of silence. The father's fear versus grandmother's wisdom creates genuine internal tension that pays off when she decides to bring him a vial "to show him that safety could expand rather than contract."

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation to transform passengers through understanding silence is clear and rooted in his own past trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadow keeper's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction—her scars glow when teaching wounds to become doorways, and her specific method of "surgical precision" in severing relationships shows earned wisdom through visible cost. The final choice to continue this isolated teaching role lands with genuine ambiguity about whether her renunciation is salvation or self-imprisonment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's transformation from pyramid scheme victim to someone who "dances with pressure" is earned through concrete details and embodied moments.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aldric's transformation from isolated knight to guardian of possibility reads as earned through seven years of solitude learning the trees' languages.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is rooted in concrete specificity—searching for his mother's true story "hidden between bureaucratic lines." His discovery of the button triggers embodied response ("warming in his palm"), and his choice to preserve these "small acts of grace" shows values hierarchy with visible cost (choosing archives over relationships).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization with embodied emotion ("mouth opened and closed without sound") and clear internal conflict between perfectionism and self-acceptance.

Her final understanding that learning means recognizing timewoven alliances represents genuine growth with visible cost—she abandons technological certainty for intuitive navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation builds coherently through discovery of postcards to understanding their purpose as instruction, with concrete embodied details like "fingertips still stained with phosphorescent paint."

Her final transformation from arsonist to "keeper of imperishable memory" carries earned cost through the genetic memory revelation, though some internal states lean toward summary ("wasn't proud of her past") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal rebellion through drumming creates contradictory impulses that act in scene, particularly in her maintenance of individual consciousness while entering the collective. The final choice to transform rather than extract is earned through prior causality with visible cost (her body failing). Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("experimental treatment guinea pig") and slightly convenient knowledge of the scientists' true purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—with concrete embodiment through his gait recognition ability and patient observation. The final choice to give away the zodiac coin shows genuine character cost, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("wisdom traveled best in whispers").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's characterization through sustained silence and purposeful gesture creates a compelling presence, with her "spiralingly calm movements" embodying her philosophy. Thomas's grief over unfinished confession to his grandmother provides clear motivation. The transformation from burden to understanding feels earned through the mirror/shutter demonstration, though the epiphany arrives somewhat smoothly for the emotional weight involved.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation to teach strategic thinking is clear and his gift of hearing unspoken words creates genuine internal conflict, particularly in the Elena scene. The character makes meaningful choices that build toward the synchronized window display rebellion. However, Elena's rapid progression from sobbing child to declaring "checkmate" to the old world lacks the embodied emotional complexity needed for higher bands, and some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("systematic suppression of strategic thought") rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal conflict between performed masculinity and authentic self drives compelling choices, particularly in the unwrapping scene. The contradiction between protection through disguise and imprisonment by it creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for Torven's somewhat abrupt emotional softening, though his vulnerability lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The performer's emotional void technique creates a compelling contradiction—emptiness as resistance—with Mrs. Chen's grief journey providing genuine stakes. The final transformation from "drowning" to "weightless sorrow" shows earned change through specific ritual, not epiphany. Minor deduction for the performer remaining somewhat archetypal despite strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear but relies heavily on abstract concepts ("cloud-shadow poetry," "paraphrasing reality") without sufficient embodied emotion or concrete internal contradiction. The character functions more as a vehicle for thematic exploration than a fully realized individual with specific, conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's colorblind perspective creates genuine specificity through "infinite shades of gray" and her cunning use of flower language to read Enzo's emotional state. The father-daughter arc earns its resolution through concrete details (burned letters, concertina reed), though Enzo's quick vulnerability shift feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's internal shift from questioning prescribed ritual to creating authentic connection is well-motivated through the carbide lens metaphor and grandmother's mining wisdom. The contradictory impulses between duty and innovation play out in scene through her bell-playing choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of connection" that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's grief-driven transformation from wedding rings to memorial pieces provides clear motivation, with contradictory impulses (designing the phoenix tattoo but unable to commit) acting in scene. The final choice to help another griever while contemplating her own permanent mark lands with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for the stranger's entrance feeling slightly convenient, though her parallel grief creates effective pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's motivation as a digital archaeologist tracking cultural patterns is clear and consistent, with her "steadily curious nature" driving concrete investigative actions. The internal logic of her practice—reading futures from digital footprints—remains coherent throughout, though Marcus lacks dimensional pressure beyond academic validation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's unpatterned consciousness and chaotic movement training create a unique character logic that drives the entire piece. The transformation from infiltrator to living filter shows genuine cost through embodied suffering ("convulsing—no, transforming"), though some interior passages edge toward abstraction ("transmuting their civilization's end into a beginning").

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and builds through discovered evidence toward the grandmother connection, with embodied grief ("tears that caught the library's prismatic light") and genuine discovery. The final choice to preserve shadows alongside dreams feels earned through prior causality. However, some interiority edges toward explanatory ("knowing that some dreams take generations to bloom") rather than fully embodied, and the transformation from observer to active preserver could use more visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's internal contradiction between healer and deceiver drives authentic choices throughout, particularly in the surgery sequence where competing impulses act simultaneously. The final acceptance of "knowing exactly who she was when everything false had been stripped away" represents earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("facades falling away") in mid-crisis reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's obsessive need to reopen healed wounds drives genuine internal contradiction, with embodied details like "drilling microscopic tunnels through scar tissue" grounding the compulsion. The final realization that "some wounds were meant to stay open, not as injury but as invitation" earns its resonance through prior dramatization, though the epiphany arrives somewhat cleanly without sufficient struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's psychometric gift creates clear motivation through embodied perception ("swaying, caught in the rhythm") and concrete internal conflict between professional duty and preservation instinct. The final choice to steal the film strip shows earned agency with visible cost—her report will lie, but the love letters find witness.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her gift of hearing stellar voices, driving her sacrifice. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneity—her decision to dissolve feels predetermined rather than struggled-for in the moment. The transformation from "moonstruck dreamer" to cosmic sacrifice works but needed more embodied resistance at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kess's motivation to guard consciousness fragments and cultivate possibility is clear and embodied through concrete actions like "sweet-talking reality into brief moments of solidity." The confrontation with the pirate reveals her values through tactical choice rather than declaration. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of her internal stakes - we understand her purpose but not the personal cost of her dreamlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to recover "untamed thought" drives consistent choices, with internal contradiction between his careful philosopher-self and wild-frontier memories creating genuine tension. The final choice to seed others' minds with mechanical growth shows earned agency with visible cost (dissolution into morning light). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("unlimited possibility") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's internal contradiction between wanting freedom for her dog and fearing loss manifests beautifully through embodied details like the star-punched ticket and "fingers that knew how to open." The confession "I was never brave enough to let him run free" crystallizes her motivational core. Minor deduction for the ferry guides remaining somewhat archetypal despite their "gently persistent" characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's motivation through frostbite-damaged nerves and his obsessive retention of the piano bolt creates embodied character specificity. Elena's transformation from "seraphically mundane" devotion to surgical reconstruction and eventual return shows earned change with visible cost. The story loses points for some diagnostic exposition about "unpardonable silence" and slightly convenient resolution of the choir's condition.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Syln's characterization succeeds through concrete contradictions—ancient titan serving as humble librarian, immense power expressed through quiet ink-making. The pretender's false composure cracking when confronted with the pellet reveals character under pressure. Minor deduction for the true heir arriving without sufficient embodiment or cost shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation crystallizes through the tapping rhythm that connects her to her grandmother's hidden knowledge, with internal contradiction between scientific duty and personal quest. The final descent shows earned agency through accumulated understanding, though some emotional transitions (especially the grandmother connection) could be more embodied rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's awkward confidence manifests physically through barefoot grounding and deliberate-yet-off-balance movements, creating genuine embodied character. Her progression from inherited observation (opera glasses) to revolutionary understanding shows earned change with visible cost—the three-month lull's exhaustion giving way to dangerous hope. Internal contradiction between caution and conviction plays out through concrete actions rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Chen's motivation is clear and rooted in her discovery of plant communication, driving escalating choices from intelligence gathering to decisive action. The internal conflict between preservation and release is embodied in her handling of the amber. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("compliant drones") and the lieutenant's too-convenient immediate recognition at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied trauma response through somatic markers and the palm-to-bark grounding moment. The protagonist's quiet talent emerging post-bombing creates compelling internal complexity. Minor deduction for some therapeutic self-awareness ("Dr. Mansour had taught her to read these somatic markers") that feels slightly too diagnostic for peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's internal conflict between seeing fragmented reality and needing to paint coherent portraits drives genuine stakes through embodied contradiction ("fingers trembled," "cracked and luminous with grief"). The transformation from "celebrated portraitist" to someone who embraces "magnificently, necessarily shattered" subjects shows earned change with visible professional cost. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("redesigning herself") in the climactic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tracker's "serene anger" manifests consistently through methodical observation and seven years of pursuit, with clear motivation driving her investigation. The final transformation from anger to understanding feels earned through accumulated evidence, though internal contradiction could be more viscerally embodied during the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's internal conflict between duty and truth is well-embodied through concrete actions like her trembling grip on the letter and deliberate scanner sequences. The contradiction between her oath as archivist and loyalty to Marcus/truth operates simultaneously throughout. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("terrible peace") in the final beat that edges toward label-speak rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's character shows genuine complexity through embodied contradiction—her "senseless perception" manifests concretely in reading sand shifts and plant responses, while her father's transformation from hunter to learner creates earned change with visible cost. The internal conflict between violence and cultivation drives authentic choices, though some moments edge toward therapy-speak ("teaching them to weave continuity through chaos").

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kova's cool-headed expertise drives meaningful choices through "voicing silence" and the final echo-catching, with internal complexity shown through her steady surface against "heart hammered rhythms." The transformation from fisher to voice-bearer lands with clear cost ("ready to be cast forward into the world's wounds"), though some interiority relies on telling rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's internal contradiction between exposing truth and protecting empire drives genuine tension through concrete choices (crafting the Tokyo misdirection). The rosewood nib kiss as "goodbye to honesty" embodies her moral compromise with specificity. Minor deduction for the convenient proxy death mentioned in passing without dramatized impact.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation through the amber pendant and gift for translation is clear and embodied. The internal experience of hearing "subsonic guilt" and working through frequencies shows concrete specificity. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract - we don't feel the personal cost to Mara beyond professional duty, limiting the character's full dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Seraphina's socially perceptive nature manifests through concrete embodied perception ("chalk-stained fingers trembling," sensing the grotto's anxiety) and her artist's understanding drives the central insight about composting memory. The transformation from trying to capture whispers to allowing them new shapes shows genuine internal conflict resolved through earned understanding, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("meaning wasn't something to preserve but something to discover").

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sarai's contradictory impulses between restoration and transformation act simultaneously throughout, particularly in "My hands were never clean. But mercy isn't about purity." The retrocognitive curse creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost. Minor deduction for the old man serving primarily as exposition vehicle rather than applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cornelius's synesthetic perception and longing for Isabella create specific, embodied motivation that drives every choice. The internal contradiction between his desire for applause ("honey and copper") and his deeper need for Isabella lands powerfully. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around temporal concepts that could be more grounded in sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's somatic markers create a distinctive embodied decision-making system, and David's affectionate skepticism generates genuine relational pressure. The transformation from skeptic to "participatory wonder" feels earned through concrete discovery. Deduction for some abstract phrasing around connection and empathy that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira's augmented sensory abilities and role as "last sensory map maker" create clear, consistent motivation throughout, with embodied perception ("fingertips that could taste temperature variations") grounding her unique POV. The final choice to teach rather than translate shows agency with visible cost—abandoning her unique translator role. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("ancient joy glowed amber") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's transformation from passive archivist to active creator of possibility is well-motivated through concrete discoveries (buttons as timeline markers, canyon echo's resonance). Her final choice to "spin futures from threads of what might have been" carries visible cost—she accepts the weight of infinite potential over certainty. Internal consistency holds throughout, though some epiphanic moments ("understood her true purpose") arrive slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot's three-year burn creates genuine stakes, and her choice between delivery and return carries visible cost. The internal contradiction between anger and understanding plays out through concrete action rather than summary, though Viktor's motivations could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thomas demonstrates clear motivation rooted in purpose-driven compassion, with embodied contradictions between his patient stillness and active weaving. The woman's determination carries genuine weight through "the particular shadow that fell across features when trust had been shattered." Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in resolution, though the "golden thread" metaphor earns its place through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the wheel's rhythm in her bones, the glass thrumming against her spine. Her final understanding arrives through patient observation matching her potter's discipline, with visible cost in the "fractured timelines" she's endured. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "kindness" concept that could use more embodied grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's internal contradiction between holding on and letting go manifests through concrete actions—clutching the gauge, pressing it into the dock, finally wedging it there. Her motivation to honor transitions while opening space for renewal drives the closure choice with visible cost (releasing the inherited tool).

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira's transformation from brittle awakening to understanding coexistence is earned through concrete details like the sundial's atomic reflection showing her fractured selves. The internal contradiction between isolation and independence plays out through embodied moments—pressing her palm to the sundial, feeling the hum in her sternum. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "extinct wisdom" and "paradox" in the final paragraph that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's characterization succeeds through concrete particulars—her seven years of ghostwriting revealing patterns, the physical act of tracing nest spirals. The closure choice to reveal her own repeated refrains ("solder and jasmine") earns the reconnection with Chen. Minor deduction for Chen's somewhat thin presence despite being crucial to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority ("tracing constellations with trembling fingers") and embodied emotion. The character makes specific micro-choices under pressure (using emergency broadcast system, working with "ethereal precision"). Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("knowing the AI would adapt and return") that feels too articulate for crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction that drives tactical choices (memorizing passages, calculating escape routes) and makes his transformation at closure earned. The "prudently adventurous" paradox manifests concretely in his preparation methods and descent decision. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("clawing at his chest") and the final paragraph's slight drift toward thematic summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sarah's prosopagnosia creates a compelling contradiction—a portrait artist who cannot recognize faces—and her methodical compensation through texture and pattern feels authentic. The internal logic of seeking "wholeness through others' divisions" drives credible choices, though the killer's psychology arrives somewhat abstractly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with concrete embodied details like pressing the copper nail "between her thumb and forefinger." The internal conflict between "idealistic certainty wavering only slightly" and "spongey dread" creates genuine tension. However, the final choice to broadcast coordinates lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands—the decision feels predetermined rather than torn.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marla's internal journey from fragmented self-judgment to understanding her role as "ferryman of forgiveness" shows clear motivation with embodied details like "bow trembling against strings." The transformation is earned through specific experience, though the hitchhiker remains more symbolic than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited understanding of territorial marking and pattern recognition. His patient, methodical approach and final choice to educate rather than threaten shows consistent character logic. The internal conflict between immediate deterrence and deeper teaching lands with cost—he accepts maintaining his father's prison of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her role as dream chronicler and her unique healing gift. The story shows her processing discovery through concrete actions (examining the telegram, adjusting the telescope, documenting findings) rather than pure interiority. However, the "healing with words" attribute feels more stated than embodied in scene-level choices, and Dr. Hayashi remains functionally thin as a sounding board rather than applying genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and stakes-driven, with concrete internal experience ("warlike serenity") and embodied choices under pressure. The ancestor's complex sacrifice - accepting dishonor to protect salvation - creates layered characterization. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("defied nature's laws") and the convenience of Kael's specific talent perfectly matching what's needed.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's root-bound nature creates genuine internal tension between being anchored and understanding temporal flux, with her "purposefully curious" trait driving concrete investigative actions. The final choice to sign the covenant carries visible cost ("ready to sign her name in starlight"), though the emotional specificity could deepen beyond "anxious elation."

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's reckless idealism and the hole in her soul create clear, embodied motivation that drives her descent and ultimate choice to bite the apple. The internal contradiction between her need to fix things and awareness of the cost ("trammel your own fate") generates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the keeper's dialogue veering toward diagnostic label-speak ("That's your gift and curse"), but the final fusion of destinies lands with earned transformation and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's internal contradiction between expertise and self-doubt manifests concretely through his handling of the speaker cloth, with embodied memory ("His fingers remembered wrapping it around cable runs"). The final choice to embrace preservation as performance lands with earned cost, though some interiority veers toward over-articulation ("longing not as emptiness but as space waiting to be filled").

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sarah's methodical nature and haunted ambitions create consistent motivation that drives her to consume the seed despite understanding its weight. The contradiction between scholarly detachment and obsessive pursuit plays out concretely through her choice. Minor deduction for the convenient alignment of her personality being "preparation" rather than genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaine's contradictory nature (mechanical/organic, keeper/story) manifests through embodied details like "bronze mechanisms clicking softly" and drives the central choice to help others "smelt" identities. The visitor's transformation provides external pressure that validates Kaine's method. Minor deduction for the visitor remaining somewhat archetypal despite her prismatic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's transformation from professional distance to vulnerability is earned through concrete discoveries, with contradictory impulses acting in scene ("found herself reaching for her inspection knife" despite "professional distance"). The final choice to reconnect carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("vulnerability felt too much like the disasters") in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's guilt-driven obsession with documenting rivers after failing to save a drowning teenager creates compelling internal contradiction, particularly in his "daringly methodical" nature that both caused his failure and drives his attempted redemption. The transition from numbed medication to sharp-edged reality embodied through physical sensations (ivy's fingers, crumbling brick) grounds his emotional state effectively. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed epiphany about rivers teaching "to let go" which could have emerged more organically from his map-drawing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The veiled dreamer's progression from seeker to keeper shows clear motivation rooted in the cipher's unfolding, with embodied details like the watch growing warm against her palm. The transformation lands with visible cost—she must document forever, becoming part of the library's system. Internal contradictions between caution and exuberance operate throughout, though some abstract phrasing ("mixture of caution and exuberance") lacks full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's internal conflict between academic ambition and moral duty creates genuine tension, with her choice to forge documents showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of her "academic empire" carries visible cost. However, Marcus reads somewhat thin as pure antagonist, and Elara's sudden plant telepathy feels convenient rather than earned through prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's transformation from beautician to mortician to hybrid role carries genuine emotional weight, with her calculated movements and "lucidly watchful" consciousness embodying survival under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal journey from forgiveness to self-recognition as eternal caretaker is earned through concrete embodied moments—climbing the tree, touching the jade pin, perceiving the spiral. The contradictory impulses between loss ("Contentment died with those scrolls") and understanding crystallize in a costly renunciation of individual identity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation crystallizes through the hollow mirror shard and his daughter's suicide, with clear internal contradiction between wanting absolution and understanding. The Arbiter's detached professionalism creates effective contrast. Minor deduction for "sincerely insincere" and "protected vulnerability" reading as authorial labels rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's backwards aging creates genuine internal complexity, particularly in how she experiences time ("cells remembering tomorrow while forgetting yesterday"). The final revelation that she's "teaching us to see time differently" lands as earned character insight rather than twist, though Marcus remains somewhat functional as student-vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Yula's centuries-long stillness as active navigation creates genuine internal contradiction between her younger self's belief in movement and her current mastery through stasis. The choice to remain motionless for 300 years carries visible cost in the "dust coated shoulders like a second skin," though the emotional progression feels slightly abstract in places.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's transformation from failed Academy student to discovering "the most powerful magic of all" is earned through concrete choices—unstrapping the medallion, stepping onto mist, accepting imperfection. The internal contradiction between her inability to perform standard magic and her ultimate mastery of something deeper drives authentic character change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlow's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - searching the sunken library, reading Elena's journal, accepting the luminous vows. The sister relationship provides genuine emotional weight. However, the transformation happens too smoothly without sufficient internal resistance or cost to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voss's contradictory temporal existence creates genuine internal tension ("stellar doubt that gnawed at her consciousness"), and her final understanding carries visible cost - eternal repetition as the universe's memory. The "quietly enthusiastic" attribute manifests naturally through her practiced ritual despite cosmic uncertainty. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "modified consciousness" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper's motivation to name her fears after discovering her predecessor's similar wound creates clear causality, with contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) acting throughout. The transformation from unnamed monsters to "companions" shows earned change with visible cost—eternal isolation as the price of saving love. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hollow ache," "vast hurt") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's characterization succeeds through consistent embodiment of "lukewarm magic" as both limitation and precise advantage - her weakness becomes essential to the delicate calibration needed. The final choice to persist despite mockery shows earned conviction with visible exhaustion as cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("grief over her fisherman father had driven her mad") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation crystallizes powerfully when he discovers Elena's photograph, transforming from dutiful documentation to moral witness. The internal shift from methodical warden to keeper of suppressed truth is earned through concrete discoveries. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional processing ("memories were fragments, but now...they crystallized") rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's internal contradiction between scientific mastery and intuitive wonder drives authentic tension, with embodied moments like her heart quickening at the waterfall. The final choice to sublime the crystal demonstrates earned transformation through prior causality. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ancient freshness") and slightly over-articulated epiphanies about alchemy's "greatest secret."

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details like the worn parachute buckle habit and her withholding of crucial data, with internal conflict between corporate duty and preservation enacted through her lie about the six-month timeline. The final stance as "guardian of secrets" is earned through prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's emotional numbness following consciousness splitting is embodied through concrete details like "hollow as the stone chambers" and the memory of terror without feeling. The contradiction between intellectual understanding and emotional vacancy drives authentic internal conflict, particularly in "I feel nothing, and that terrifies the part of me that still remembers terror." Minor deduction for occasional therapy-speak ("ego death," "reset one's entire being") that slightly dulls immediacy in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her professional identity as someone who creates spaces that "bent reality through orthogonal approaches." Her recognition of the corpse flower seed shows specific knowledge, and her understanding that "this wasn't just about planting" but preservation demonstrates layered thinking under pressure. The transformation from individual guardian to teacher of others lands with earned wisdom, though the emotional complexity could deepen further in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his "mournfully eager" state creates genuine internal contradiction. The Hendricks family's grief is embodied through specific cessations (Emma's singing, father's whistling). The transformation from grief to laughter feels earned through Marcus's ritualistic action, though Emma's final laugh could use more embodied resistance before breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's feral transformation is embodied through concrete details (clicking growls, bare feet, vertical pupils) and her contradictory impulses between isolation and homesickness act simultaneously throughout. The final choice to trust uncertainty is earned through her established relationship with it ("befriended uncertainty. It lived in her bones"), though the scholar's rapid trust strains slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in thirty years of failure, with concrete internal conflict between preservation doctrine and his discovered truth about transformation. The final choice to destroy the crozier halves is earned through thirteen prior attempts. Deduction for some therapy-speak ("letting each failure cut deep enough to teach") and slight emotional tidiness in resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and grounded in her professional expertise pivoting toward personal quest. Her internal contradiction between Guild training and intuitive discovery drives authentic choices.

Torven's shift from aggression to vulnerable asking provides crucial relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mrs. Chen's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, her grief held in the brittle bouquet. The performer's blankness is a perfectly executed moral and emotional ambiguity, a credible stance of endurance. Their micro-choices—the offering of the flowers, the acceptance—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s characterization is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pressing his palm to the pillar) revealing his hierarchy of values. His motivation—to complete what he started seven years ago—intensifies credibly, and his final renunciation (not destruction but transformation) is earned by prior causality. The only minor flaw is a slight over-reliance on aesthetic terminology in peak beats, but it remains character-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority ("Gray comes in infinite shades") and micro-choices under pressure (flower arrangements as communication).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Vera's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her final choice to improvise feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in abandoning tradition. The carbide lens anchors her shift in perception, and her internal contradiction (hollow title vs. new meaning) acts in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena's characterization is deeply embodied through specific, grief-informed actions (folding cranes, lighting candles) and micro-choices (offering the crane).

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira's characterization is profound and embodied, particularly her "steadily unpredictable" nature which is a concrete trait shown through action. Her final choice to absorb the plague is a credible, high-stakes renunciation earned by the preceding tiers of darker truths. A slight tendency toward abstract emotional labeling ("anguished joy") in the climax prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a dedicated archivist, intensifying through her obsession with the shadow's migration. Her interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in her emotional response to the revelation ("eyes filled with tears that caught the library's prismatic light"). The final choice to preserve shadows is earned by the causality of her grandmother's hidden dream and her own thirty years of work. A minor deduction for the underdeveloped pressure from her colleagues, who exist only as a dismissed obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina's characterization is rich with embodied contradiction, particularly in the surgical beat where removing bio-chips parallels shedding her own facades. Her final choice to confess and accept consequences feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sanctuary's closure and animal relocations. The micro-choice to type the public confession reveals a hierarchy of values reshaped by the night's events.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent and specific trait (reading scars as libraries), and intensifies under pressure. Her final realization is earned through on-page sensory experience and micro-choices, such as tracing the coffee ring.

The final stance of remaining open is a credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her professional role, with a credible emotional shift from clinical duty to personal connection. Her embodied emotion ("kissed the film strip once, tasting silver and salt") and the micro-choice to preserve the film demonstrate a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, the final renunciation lacks a moment of on-page internal contradiction or struggle, feeling slightly inevitable rather than earned through a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in her unique trait of hearing stellar thoughts. Her final choice to surrender is earned, though a touch more internal contradiction in the peak beat could elevate it further. The felt cost of her dissolution is visible on the page.

    Kess's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in her role as a guardian and her dreamless state.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Stray Philosopher's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his journey to the Loom Tree. His internal conflict—between his "careful, catalogued garden of philosophy" and the "wild frontier" he rediscovers—is concrete and embodied in his actions with the gear.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied past trauma. His final understanding is earned through on-page causality, and his micro-choices (carrying the bolt, returning to the hotel) reveal his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Syln's motivation is clear and intensifies from quiet devotion to active defense, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her gnarled but steady hands and quiet resolve reveal character under pressure.

The pretender's composure cracking provides a minor but effective secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, compelling her to higher-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kira’s characterization is concrete and embodied, with her “awkward confidence” filtering through specific micro-choices like gripping the textured steel with her toes. Her internal conflict between exhaustion and nascent hope is dramatized, not summarized, culminating in an earned epiphany that redefines the rebellion’s stall as an inhalation, not a failure. The final choice to “reignite” is motivated by the stones’ resonance and her grandmother’s wisdom, charging her endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Chen’s motivation is clear and rooted in her unique plant-connection, compelling high-stakes choices. Her final action feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the soldiers' arrival.

Her final stance—aligning with the indifference of growth—is an earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost, rooted in prior causality. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic flavor in the somatic marker description, though it is quickly anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, her internal conflict is embodied and concrete ("fingers trembled"), and her final renunciation of her old way of seeing is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tracker's "serene anger" and "consciously wild methodology" are embodied through concrete micro-choices, like her deliberate ink spill and pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in a credible internal conflict between oath and truth. Her final choice is earned by the backstory with Marcus and the letter's arrival.

    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique gift and the amber heirloom. Her internal conflict is embodied through the tactile use of her tools and the amber's warmth, and her final act of tethering digital ghosts is a high-stakes choice earned by prior causality. The micro-choice to use the amber as a lens reveals her values and incurs the visible cost of its fracture. A hairline slip: her ability to translate baby cries, while established, is not directly leveraged in the on-page action, making it a minor tell-not-shown element.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seraphina's characterization is vivid through concrete actions (chalk-stained fingers, deliberate sand placement) and a clear, evolving motivation. Her "socially perceptive" nature is demonstrated, not just stated, as she reads the grotto's anxiety. The final renunciation of order for mess is earned by the tile's revelation. A slight deduction for the trait's initial tell-y presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sarai's contradictory impulses (mercy vs. guilt, restoration vs. creation) are dramatized through embodied micro-choices like pressing the tessera and weeping from "strange, cold warmth."

    Kira's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her higher-stakes choice to engage with the entity. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, filtered through her sensory modifications. The final renunciation (teaching others to hear) is earned by her prior causality as a map maker.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's characterization is consistent and her motivation intensifies credibly, moving from maintenance to active creation. Her "quiet inspiration" is shown through specific, tactile actions like holding the echo jar. The final choice to open the jar and reconfigure prophecy is earned by her prior methodical work. However, interior contradiction is subtle rather than stark, and the emotional cost of her seventeen-year isolation is more implied than deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Margot's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete interiority ("Three years of anger compressed into four syllables"). Her final choice is earned by the revelation, though Viktor's late arrival limits on-page relationship pressure.

    Marcus's claustrophobia and "prudently adventurous" nature are embodied and drive his micro-choices under pressure, particularly his focus on breathing and the compass.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sarah's prosopagnosia is a profound, character-specific trait that drives her unique methodology and filters her perception of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s vocation and insomnia braid into a coherent drive that motivates each turn (opening the package, descending, choosing to remain). Interiority is specific and embodied (“bubble of breathable grief,” teeth aching), not label‑only. The change at the end—abandoning the living to tend the dead library—reads as earned stasis with cost. A touch more on his hesitation or competing pull toward his former life would intensify the contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marta’s motive—building a fabric of anonymous mutual aid—drives consistent choices from the first bell to the renunciation at the end. Interiority is concrete and particular (“need has no face”), with small, credible micro-choices (timed deliveries, anonymity, accepting Samuel’s help). Internal contradiction is modest; her stance remains steady rather than contested, limiting peak complexity. Still, the endurance-to-renunciation arc reads earned and human.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mae’s longing, embodied attention, and micro-choices (using the tear, the breath pattern, opening the camera to release images) are motivated and consistent. Internal conflict is gentle rather than oppositional, but the renunciation of her photographs registers as a credible cost. The ghost acts as catalyst rather than a competing will, keeping focus on Mae’s interior drive. Strong, if more devotional than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—to understand and unbind herself from “retrocognitive imprisonment”—is clear and coherent, and her micro-choices (stepping onto the bridge, proceeding to the center, accepting dissolution) track with it. The interiority is vivid and embodied through tactile plant language and the fragment’s sensations. However, the conflict resolves with relative ease; genuine resistance or costly doubt surfaces only briefly, making the final acceptance feel slightly tidy. Still, the renunciation of the fragment and the loss of other selves registers as a credible, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s patient, strategic nature motivates each action, from token‑filing the link to decoding the piano and harvesting seeds. Interiority is concrete and object‑driven (arrow, piano, prizes) rather than label‑heavy. Contradictory impulses are minimal; he rarely wavers or shows fear, which slightly flattens tension. The closing choice to leave with seeds reads earned and aligned with his established values.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—Elena seeks the “frequency of betrayal”—and her actions (activating the forge, imprinting absences) align. Interiority is specific, filtered through synesthesia and grief without therapy-speak. The change to acceptance feels earned, though internal contradiction (doubt vs. compulsion) stays mostly implicit rather than dramatized under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, idiosyncratic motive (truth over theft) and professional competence anchor Cassia, with concise backstory (grandmother’s photo) grounding her method. Interiority is specific to a light‑obsessed mind, and the client’s need applies immediate, human pressure. However, her internal conflict is light; she bears the cost but never wavers, so the final stance feels earned yet low‑friction. The mother registers as a real presence but functions mainly as a catalyst rather than a counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s motives are clear and specific—transforming a place of containment into vessels for inquiry—filtered through tactile ritual and the bookmark’s paternal legacy. Interiority is embodied in action (sweeping shards, flame tuning, sphere placement) rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses are subtle (catastrophe memory vs. deliberate hope) and could sharpen under direct pressure. The brief exchange with the couple reveals her values under scrutiny without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: a fear‑conditioned stunt double discovering his engineered nature and choosing to act. Interiority is embodied (shell hums, metal’s chill) and contradictions play on the page (terror as safeguard turned weapon). The relationship crucible with Jake shows a legible status shift. A touch of expositional neatness in the “decrypting on the drive” beat slightly softens the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motivation (to map the darkness) and a consistent perceptual signature anchor her. The earned renunciation—accepting the star won’t die tonight—reads credible and character‑true. Internal contradiction is present but soft (obsession vs. patience) and could cut deeper on the page. Embodied detail (stiff joints, clutching the booklet) helps ground the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Seven’s motive—find the origin of thought—is clear and character‑specific, and his janitor programming credibly shapes tactics and perception. Interiority is concrete (temperature readouts, repetitive cycles) with a distinctive robot sensibility. However, internal conflict is low; he remains serenely competent, so pressure never truly unsettles him. The final endurance/acceptance feels earned but pays a modest emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, credible motives (protecting Marcus, seeking transparency) drive Mira’s choices, and her internal conflict between protection and honesty is dramatized rather than stated. The relationship dynamic carries real weight, with subtext in the doodles and their cautious approach. The admission of her own misdirection adds flaw and cost. Slight safety in emotional calibration (quick relief after Marcus’s off‑stage confession) keeps it from the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marta’s motive—to defy quantified fate through practiced, nurturing deceit—is vivid and consistent, and her rituals (polishing marbles, training wires) externalize her inner ethic. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“lying to plants” as craft), with embodied gestures throughout. However, there’s little true internal contradiction or cost on the page; she never doubts or falters, so the change reads more as continuation than crucible-tested shift. The brief mentor moment adds relationship texture but doesn’t force a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and specific—she’s the “obliging sky mechanic” risking duty to prove time moves sideways. The micro‑choice to ignore Sector Nine’s pressure drop for the experiment reveals values under stress. Interiority is concrete but not deeply conflicted; she rarely wavers, so the cost feels more conceptual than emotional. The ending earns a stance shift (navigator of time), though the felt price is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motive—to complete Elisabetta’s interrupted piece—drives concrete choices (returning to the flooded hall, transcribing, stepping deeper to play). Interiority is particular to a musician’s perception, with embodied costs (holding the violin high, chest‑deep water). Internal contradiction is light; he’s steady rather than conflicted, so complexity is modest. Still, actions align tightly with motive and culminate in a credible endurance choice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motives are clear and particular—staying to locate and “weigh” a swallowed truth—and her micro-choices (calibrating the magnetometer, drawing, smudging the signature, deciding to conceal) align with her fault-tolerance. Interiority is embodied and character-specific (truths “swaying like prayer flags,” “like altitude sickness”). The internal contradiction—holding multiple truths while navigating institutional scrutiny—feels lived, not declared. Stakes are modest but credible, with a felt cost in her choice to protect rather than publish.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s motives are clear and particular—skeptical yet reverent toward the stories places tell—and his micro-choices (frequency-tuning, following pipes, refusing to touch the wheel) reveal a credible ethical struggle. The internal contradiction (skeptic who honors haunting) is dramatized rather than declared. The final renunciation—photographing and leaving the valve—reads as an earned endurance with visible cost. Minor note: the “Methodist” line toes summary but is grounded by his conduct.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear rituals (unfolding the swan, refusing speech, teaching the fold) reveal character through action, and her renunciation is consistent and particular. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she moves with serene acceptance rather than tension, so the internal crucible never truly bites. The cost—erosion of speech/self—registers, but micro-choices under pressure are few. Still, her embodied practice and worldview are coherently dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivation—to keep and then relinquish the curl as a ritual of wonder—feels specific and consistent with her identity as a music therapist. The embodied choice to play the flute and then release the curl under pressure of the eclipse lands as a credible trade‑off. Internal conflict is present but gentle; she’s reluctant yet ready, yielding a believable, earned renunciation. Sofia’s presence adds pressure and tenderness without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Keeper Thrain’s motives and methods are clear and character-specific: a listener-historian navigating by echo whose tactile reading of walls and ash guides every move. Interiority is embodied (fingers reading pressure of pen) rather than labeled. The arc—a recommitment to tending the echo after a reframing insight—lands without sentimentality. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is minimal; doubt or temptation rarely complicates her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Chen’s motives—tired of writing others’ fates and intent on “becoming his own music”—are specific and consistent with his spy‑adjacent craft. Interiority is crisp and embodied through the beam’s rhythm and the microdot specs, not therapy‑speak. The renunciation at the end (leaving the specs to be found, stepping through the lighthouse door) feels earned by prior patterning. Slight reliance on summarized backstory limits the sense of acute internal contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motive—exorcising by illuminating assumptions—drives his tactics with coherence and restraint, and his professional calm fits the method. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he never truly doubts or risks a wrong move, which limits felt struggle. The woman’s arc is present but largely functional to the conceit. The small renunciation—refusing to rush despite a time warning—helps earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei’s motivation—becoming the conductor of unheard symphonies before exhaustion—stays specific and embodied through tactile choices (arranging fortunes in a spiral, raising her arms). Contradictory impulses register (deadline vs. fatigue; dismissal vs. compulsion). Interiority is character‑particular, filtered through music/time perception rather than generic labels. The cost is subtle but present: isolation, job loss, and surrender to a non‑linear identity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, character-driven stakes—Kira’s fear of collapse versus her need to integrate—are embodied in concrete actions (hovering under impossible weight, pressing the feared rune). Interiority is specific and image-led rather than diagnostic. The elder Kira’s intervention sharpens her ambivalence without removing agency. Minor abstraction in statements about “labyrinth of self” stays earned by tactile beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lucia’s motive (defeat numbness, find a new way to “listen”) is clear and enacted through concrete choices. Interiority is vivid and embodied via tactile listening and bone‑felt resonance. Internal contradiction is present but gentle; the epiphany trends tidy, with limited friction or misstep on the way to acceptance. Still, the final stance feels earned by the experiment and cost of what’s lost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s meticulousness, caution, and integrity drive all choices, with clear stakes once she realizes her data is being weaponized. Fear versus duty registers in small, credible ways (lateral moves, hidden caches). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than deeply dramatized, keeping this shy of the top band. The decision to persist under surveillance reads earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—grief braided with professional caution—drives precise choices (careful uncorking; recorking; claiming the lantern). The internal contradiction between being “aromatically cautious” and choosing to risk temporal echoes reads earned. Embodied emotion (tears refracting into spectra) feels character‑specific, not generic. The renunciation/embrace at the end forecloses a previous identity (broker only) with a visible cost (bearing an archive of loss).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s motive—to see deeper layers and hold contradictory truths—is clear and consistent, and his embodied handling of the rope grounds his interiority. His decisive act of returning the rope reads as an earned renunciation consistent with his poet’s ethos. The internal conflict is present (hunger for truth vs. the cost of revelation) but remains more conceptual than felt in the body at peak moments. A touch more friction at the choice point would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent: to coax sound back from devastation without forcing it. Her embodied attention to acoustics and micro‑choices in pacing notes reveal character under pressure. Internal contradiction is light—she rarely wavers—so the arc leans more toward acceptance than contested change. The closing understanding feels earned but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s motive—harvest authentic but incomplete emotions for clients while resisting her own hunger—reads specific and credible. The internal contradiction (temptation to “subsume” vs. rule “never consume the merchandise”) operates in-scene under time pressure. Her professional habits shape micro-choices (methodical sampling, aligning the petal with her heartbeat for curation). Slight safety remains: she never falters beyond temptation, so the struggle feels contained rather than dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Margot’s competence, quiet longing, and decisive choice to deliver the locket read as motivated and consistent. Interiority is specific (“breath caught,” the pull of the roofless library), though contradictions under pressure are gentle rather than fraught. Her shift from transactional broker to civic catalyst feels earned but lightly costed. Relationship dynamics with Martha are clean and moving, if swiftly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s motivation—to weave herself into the community through art—is consistent and drives action, with concrete choices (organizing the search, offering the clasped-hands sculpture) revealing character. Interiority is mostly inferred from gestures and work rather than deeply rendered contradiction. The “boldly sympathetic” trait has on‑page consequence (earning trust; the cave approach) but carries limited cost. Secondary figures add pressure lightly; conflict remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motive—freeing creatures trapped in interrupted time—is clear and consistent, and her choices (diving into the gap; finishing the drawings) align. Interiority is present but largely duty-forward, with minimal contradictory impulses under pressure. The cost touches her (cracked pendant) and others (city loses minutes), but her internal struggle is relatively smooth. Strong competence with limited moral/psychic friction keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Morrow’s motive—to understand and possibly recover a form of presence in loss—is clear and consistent, and her careful, methodical temperament comes through in the mapping and placement acts. Interiority is specific (phosphorescent pigments, chip-sequence decoding) rather than generic. The internal conflict is gentle rather than pressured; doubt versus acceptance never bites hard. The final renunciation (leaving the eyes, accepting non-return) reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Edgar’s kindly, meticulous nature is dramatized through concrete, pressure-shaped choices (the twined reading light, the hidden caches). His contradiction—self-erasure versus the hunger to connect—surfaces without tidy therapy-speak. The archivist’s single line engages a relationship dynamic that reframes his isolation. The final renunciation of total invisibility reads earned and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s motive—studying to understand—credibly collides with his fear of losing control, culminating in the on‑page micro‑choice not to pull away as the leaf merges. Interiority is embodied (green nails, rootlike lines under skin) rather than labeled. The grandmother’s influence grounds his shift without feeling like a retrofit. The cost—relinquishing full human identity—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motive (trade an heirloom for water to make true art) is clear and embodied through fatigue, tactile handling of the brooch, and painterly perception. The internal conflict—surrendering legacy for possibility—registers in her hesitations and the jar’s “liquified time.” Micro-choices (following rain trails despite exhaustion, tasting the water) reveal values under pressure. The cost is felt and sustained in the plan to paint until the water is gone.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s motive (to understand the blindness and recover/transform her foresight) is clear and consistent, and her actions (following the pearl, choosing to “inhabit” the present) align. The internal shift lands, though conflict is relatively frictionless and fast, with little resistance before acceptance. Embodied moments—teeth aching from the pearl, sensory saturation in the cave—help ground emotion. The change is earned but carries limited on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kessa’s motive—compiling fragments into meaning for a community marked by exile—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (staggered intervals, emotional curation, repurposing the valve). Interiority is embodied via tactile archival acts rather than abstract labels. The piece is light on contradictory impulses under pressure; she mostly operates with serene competence. Still, the small renunciations and quiet endurance read credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (to test and map the arrows) is clear and grows from jittery doubt to chosen purpose. The inner contradiction—analytical resistance versus artistic recognition—animates the key decision to step onto the crack and keep going. Embodied cues (trembling fingers, humming pavement) keep emotion concrete. The cost is implied (committing to an obsessive, liminal practice) rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s skeptical rigor versus inherited mysticism generates credible internal friction, embodied in tactile moments (cold stone, warm tile, hands moving despite doubt). Her micro-choices—keeping the tile, centering it, transcribing—track cleanly with motive and pressure. The final acceptance feels earned, though the cost reads more contemplative than sharp. Slight safety in the arc (no real risk of loss beyond identity shift) keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vex’s immortality-weariness and quiet hunger for true death feel particular and credible, and her micro-choices (opening bridges, adding her fragment) track with those motives. However, the internal conflict resolves a bit easily—she moves from sensing to assent with minimal friction on the page. Her relationship with Thorne carries history but doesn’t apply much immediate pressure. The final choice reads earned but low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Maya’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a truthful embalmer executing a dishonest father’s last con-adjacent restitution, making micro-choices under pressure (continuing prep, opening the pot, threading the needle). Her honesty actively shifts Wei from vengeance to negotiation, and her final renunciation (give pot and money; bury what’s left) lands with real cost. Emotions are embodied via tactile prep details rather than labels. Wei’s arc is legible and earned without collapsing into stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, particular motivation—she recovers erased histories through exacting craft—and her micro-choices (lamp placement, meticulous charting, restraint) align consistently. Interiority is credible but largely single-note belief; there’s little contradictory impulse or fray under pressure beyond hand-ache. The monk’s silent presence provides gentle social pressure but not a crucible. The final renunciation (switching off the lamp; accepting an endless task) reads as earned endurance with modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mari’s motivation—embracing her bureaucratic erasure to become a “collector of lost stories”—is specific and consistent, and her final act of signing a new, in‑between name feels earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“memory’s texture,” the poison label’s “complex weave”). Contradictory impulses (dissolving vs. testifying) coexist on the page. The cost of choosing the in‑between identity is implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s arc from skeptic to participant is clear and motivated, with concrete micro‑choices (pressing the shell to her ear, plucking/bowing the cello, agreeing to help). Interiority is specific (the humming tic, professional lens) without therapy‑speak. Claudia applies immediate relational pressure and carries distinct voice. The cost is mostly emotional and subtle, but legible in Marina relinquishing her “myth‑buster” stance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s dual loyalties and tactician’s mindset are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices—reading codes, convening the meeting, choosing incorporation over direct confrontation. The stone chip touch and the thumb‑cut give her motives bodily texture. The internal conflict is credible and active on the page, though the choice lands with slightly tidy confidence rather than visible wobble or cost. Still, actions align cleanly with motive and reveal a specific, embodied character.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s motivation—document the last wisp before evacuation—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (descending, setting the chemical timer, placing the hourglass). Interiority is specific and embodied in tools and environment rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (duty and melancholy at retreat) are present but remain subtle rather than sharply contested. The Earned Stasis of leaving with photographs and leaving the hourglass lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s competence and worldview are vividly embodied through tactile perception and decisive craft choices. Her blindness reframed as advantage reads specific rather than generic inspiration, though internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers. The relationship with Chen offers light pressure and mirroring but doesn’t force a choice or reveal deeper fault lines. The final endurance—returning to the bench—feels earned, if low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margot’s motives—professional obligation versus clandestine obsession—are clean and drive concrete micro‑choices (hiding/revealing the phrasebook, overlaying the condensation). Her dry wit and observational bias read as character‑particular rather than generic. The inspector adds credible pressure and shifts her stance. The internal contradiction could show one sharper moment of cost‑tinged hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bell tuner’s goal and methods are clear and consistent, and her patience manifests in on‑page teaching and restraint. However, interiority is minimal; she reads as a mythic agent more than a conflicted person. Thomas and the mayor function as foils rather than pressure sources. The final renunciation (leaving) feels earned but low-cost emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s motives and contradictions are clear: survival, scientific duty to document, and seduction by transcendence. Her micro-choices (rationing the vial, recording findings, turning deeper) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Embodied details (vial against mask, teammates “absorbed”) keep emotion grounded. The daughter memory adds real cost without sentimental overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s motive—to vindicate his father and inscribe the truth before discovery—reads clear and character‑specific, with tactile micro‑choices (pressing the door, choosing testimony over confession). The interiority is vivid (“chasing hush”) and embodied through the lattice and hover. However, internal contradiction is limited; he rarely wavers, so pressure doesn’t expose competing impulses. The renaming (“True‑Tongue”) lands, but the felt personal cost at the peak remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlow’s contradictory pull—“mournful elation,” loving what poisons him—reads specific and embodied, and his talisman-touching micro-choices feel character-true. The relationship crucible with the ghost bride is vivid and morally charged. However, the decisive act at climax is largely hers, limiting his agency in the release. The cost lands, but his final stance is more acceptance than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Calla’s motive—transforming ruin into reverence through stitching—reads clear and consistent, with embodied habits (sleepwalking, needle in hand) that reveal her. However, internal contradiction is mild; we don’t see a live dilemma or a pressured choice that costs her beyond endurance. The “neither fully awake nor asleep” state offers complexity but isn’t stress‑tested by opposition. Actions align with motive and earn the quiet endurance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miriam’s conflicted return—skepticism versus the pull of recognition—reads specific and embodied, with micro-choices (following Yakov, fitting the gnomon, deciding to map) revealing values. The grandmother’s legacy exerts gentle pressure without absolving Miriam of choice. Emotional texture is credible and layered, though the turn toward recommitment edges tidy. The visible cost is subtle but present: she forecloses drift for labor and rootedness.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motive and method are vivid and particular, and her choices (naming, color selection, photographing) align with a coherent value system. Internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little pressure that exposes flaw or ambivalence. The inheritance of the clipboard and ritualistic chalking hint at depth without testing her. The ending registers endurance rather than change, credible but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s motivations and tactics are sharply etched: she weaponizes perceived senility (drool, sing-song) to gather and encode intelligence. Micro-choices under pressure—smearing blood to mark a target, extracting a flame as thread—reveal hierarchy of values and calm cunning. The internal contradiction (foolish mask vs. precise mind) stays active and credible. The only softness is limited on‑page cost beyond risk, though dignity and danger are implied.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority and a credible flaw (self‑protective silence) drive micro‑choices: she ventures into the labyrinth, commands “Show me,” selects the third window, and confesses. The maternal contradiction—gift as armor vs. love as risk—registers in tactile beats (shard pulsing, water, scars). The final choice is earned and carries cost (admitting fault, losing the shard). A slight drift toward declarative insight (“healing required exposure”) trims some messiness of emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is specific and embodied (morphine haze, phantom shoulder pain) and her micro-choices—translating the cast, drawing the bridge, relinquishing the coral—track a credible value hierarchy under pressure. Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. caretaking; retreat vs. connection) act simultaneously in scene. The relationship with the child functions as crucible without sentimentally flattening either. A faint slip toward tidy wisdom threatens complexity but doesn’t undercut the earned final act.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s desire to recover and display communal joy is clear and consistent, with tactile interiority (the warmth of plaster, the taste of crushed apple seeds). Her agency drives the piece—she asks to be shown, chooses to paint, and resolves to continue tomorrow. Internal contradiction is light; the struggle is more atmospheric than oppositional, so stakes feel gentle rather than pressurized. The closing acceptance of impermanence reads earned but not costly in a way that would sharpen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s contradiction—methodical restorer vs. playful risk‑taker—drives concrete choices (flipping the coin, then sealing it away). Her embodied perception of sound and image keeps emotions specific rather than labeled. The relationship pressure with Marcus is light but functional, sharpening the “pause” choice. The renunciation at the end reads earned, though the felt cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivations are clear—Marcus protects the language ecosystem; Serena advances it—and choices under pressure align (he stays to jam the raid, she goes to plant). Interiority is concise but character‑specific, filtered through entomological perception. The relationship dynamic is sharp and functional, though internal contradiction is light (Marcus is mostly competent calm rather than conflicted). The closing endurance feels earned with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet’s motive—to transform pain into sustenance—is coherent and sustained, with concrete acts (whispering the armistice, teaching half-lullabies, showing the postcard). Interiority is textured but largely free of contradiction; she’s steady rather than torn. Micro-choices exist but are gentled by summary, so pressure on any one decision is low. The centuries-long endurance reads as an earned stasis with cost (insomnia, solitude), but the cost is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motive and method are clear and character‑particular, and her actions align under pressure (rituals, swift adaptation to capture the name). Interiority is embodied through tactile work and the chime’s “foxglove regret.” Limited contradiction or flaw beyond solitude keeps her arc steady rather than deeply knotted. The final stance shift (“bridges to remembrance”) feels earned by on‑page effort and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motive (repairing a mistranslated treaty before the summit) is clear, and her “carefully reckless” choice to translate promise‑for‑promise against her mentor’s warning shows credible internal tension. Embodied emotion lands (trembling hands, sleepless nights). However, the path is relatively smooth—little on‑page resistance or visible cost beyond fatigue and risk awareness. The final stance (defiant, hopeful) feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives are clear and particular—she engineers a technical solution that encodes care—supported by tactile actions (unwinding the chain, carving plans). Her interiority carries contradiction (“elegant cruelty and kindness”), giving moral texture. The visible cost is modest but present (anonymity, manipulation, and forced collaboration). A sharper on‑page consequence or moment of doubt under pressure could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Margot’s motives—erasure versus reclamation—are clear and particular, embodied in acts like burning clippings and reorganizing letters by “the promises they preserved.” Her contradictory impulses (destroying her paper trail while preserving others’) operate simultaneously and culminate credibly in accepting her preserved past. The meteorite and dust‑mapping rituals reveal character under pressure without therapy‑speak. The cost—relinquishing total erasure—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s drive is clear and particular—her weather‑coded thinking and tactile reading of grain reveal a distinct mind under purpose. Emotional embodiment is vivid (e.g., matching distances to a father’s arm span), though internal contradiction is light and her path meets little resistance. The final renunciation/acceptance (“he’d found… and chosen to inhabit it”) lands, but the cost could be more behaviorally tested on the page. Still, her micro‑choices align cleanly with motive and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motive and method are clear and character‑specific, and her choices (to read the feather, to lead Chen to witness) align with a patient, pattern‑attuned temperament. However, internal contradiction is light; she begins already believing and ends with a refined version of that belief. The shift from “understanding” to “inhabiting” lands, but cost is conceptual rather than dramatized under pressure. Chen’s presence adds a mild relational angle but does not force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (gathering fragments to understand disappearing paths) and a coherent “cheerful gloom” persona. Interiority is specific (synesthetic readings of emotions) and embodied through handling the crater glass and choosing to leave before forgetting. However, internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressurized; stakes never force a sharp trade‑off beyond prudent withdrawal. The final reframe reads earned, if philosophically rather than psychologically strenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motive—engineering wonder within randomness—is clear and consistently enacted through mapped acoustics, timed sets, and repertoire shifts. Interiority is concrete and tied to tactile objects (the bishop, rosin) rather than labels. The teen beat shows adaptive empathy but reveals little contradictory impulse or cost beyond craft labor. The arc ends in endurance/charged poise rather than a risky renunciation, keeping the change modest.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—Mira chooses to “fledge” and risk capture to create a lasting verse—but internal contradiction is minimal, yielding less friction than the premise invites. Embodied detail (dew-slick stones, moon-drawn movement) grounds emotion credibly. Choices align with her values and culminate in an earned endurance stance. Lack of on‑page hesitation or competing impulse keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s vocation and perception shape credible motives and micro‑choices (tracing panes, throwing stones, deciding to document/teach). Interiority is sensorial and character‑particular to a glazier’s eye. The internal conflict—fight the development vs. reframing loss into instruction—is present but lands more as serene acceptance than a contested struggle. A few aphoristic lines edge toward tidy epiphany, softening felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s guilt, competence, and tenderness collide convincingly, and his choice to record the message grows organically from the kintsugi box and the rookie’s death. The physicality of his scars and the ridge walk embodies his interior state. A few articulations (“Every scar… is a word”) flirt with thesis-speak but are earned by prior specifics. The final renunciation—leading by exposing his cracks—feels paid for by his history.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motive—bridging timelines to understand and extend her grandmother’s work—is clear and consistent, and her actions (lantern patterns, releasing “trial balloons,” documenting equations) align. Interiority is specific and tactile (gauge, grotto), but internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little resistance and rarely wavers. The acceptance that she cannot “bring her back” but will complete the work provides a credible, if quiet, cost. Still, the emotional struggle stays mostly conceptual rather than felt through missteps or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s vocation and lineage give clear motive and a steady, embodied method; photographing before touching and tracing stones read as specific micro‑choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is light—she bears “legacy’s burden,” but we see little active doubt or competing impulse in the moment. The choice to leave her own notebook is earned and reveals values, though the cost remains mostly implied (solitude, duty). Strong presence, modest complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, specific motive (reach Sophia) drives every action, with a credible contradiction—perceptive calm versus “urgency thrumming.” Micro‑choices (painting faster, encoding the last verse, stopping precisely when the message feels sent) reveal values under pressure. We don’t see deeper flaws or self‑undermining beyond restraint, but at this length the emotional embodiment—the “borrowed heartbeat”—reads authentic. The felt cost is endurance and risk of time’s pressure rather than a moral trade.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motive—transmuted vengeance into “operatively gentle” strategy—drives precise on‑page choices (breaking ritual, centering the clipboard, reframing justice). Interiority is concrete and embodied through object handling and history. The cost is credible (risking protocol and pride), though the internal contradiction could tighten once more under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s motives are clear and textured: she engineers ruin to enact covert preservation, with embodied contradictions (“proof that even monsters could mourn”). The secrecy, black‑market purchase, and calculated cruelty toward the land and displaced people reveal a coherent, troubling ethos. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy‑speak, though on‑page struggle is ritualized more than contested. The final renunciation (entombment vs revival) lands as an earned endurance with visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyralei’s motive is clear and particular—liberation through defying the Academy’s control—and her paradox (courtesan of celibacy) shapes how she acts and perceives. Interiority is embodied (“between sigh and smile” as tactic and belief), with the echoes affecting her movement in concrete ways. The main softness is struggle: she proves hyper-competent and encounters little resistance, so the felt cost remains largely conceptual. Still, the renunciation of obedience reads earned by her prior discipline and the accumulating echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motives and method are clear and character‑specific (calligrapher using shadow/ink to interrogate ethics). His serenity under attack reads as a defining flaw/virtue, though internal contradiction is muted—he rarely wavers after the collaborators leave. The tactile handling of the story stick and ink grinding grounds interiority. The closing choice to proceed, reframing the argument backward, feels earned by prior traits.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive—honoring erased histories through ephemeral signals—is clear and embodied in concrete action, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or faces competing impulses. Her competence and tenderness are credible, yet the lack of friction limits depth. Micro-choices (knot patterns, where to place the wing) reveal values but don’t force a painful trade-off. The endurance/renunciation at the end is earned but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elsa’s motive—atonement through preservation/transformation—is clear and embodied in tactile, professional micro‑choices (unbraiding, casting bells). The guilt-to-purpose arc reads earned, with the ancestor-name reveal catalyzing her emotional release. Internal contradiction is present but subdued; she’s largely past torment by page one, so conflict skews toward contemplative pressure. The final renunciation of guilt in favor of responsibility lands with felt cost (tears freezing, charged dawn resolve).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kira’s motive—understanding why her visions pull her—drives clear, escalating micro-choices (entering, crowning, acceptance). Interiority is specific (the “precisely playful” smile as defense) and embodied by tactile details (rust, moss, water). The internal contradiction (certainty of outcomes vs ignorance of causes) animates the scene. The cost is conceptual but felt: she renounces comforting causality in favor of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—years of frugal dedication to decode the palace—reads clear and consistent, and her choices (overlaying charts, placing and speaking the square) align with that drive. Interiority is vivid but largely single‑valence; she rarely shows contradictory impulses or fear under pressure. The sacrifice is framed as long‑term devotion rather than an on‑page dilemma, which limits felt cost in the climactic beat. Still, her competence and embodied reverence give specificity and credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s “scheming pacifist” motive is clear and consistent, and the Magistrate undergoes a credible internal shift. However, the change occurs with little resistance, softening felt cost and minimizing contradictory impulses in scene. Vera functions as a pressure relay rather than a full character. Embodied emotion is present (the weeping, the tactile exchanges) but often abstracted by thematic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s competence and pragmatism ground the piece; her selections (seven mirrors, fog-silvered hand mirror) and the breathing ritual reveal character through choice. The astronomer’s desperation is credible, with a small but clear arc from skepticism to acceptance. Internal contradiction is light—Elara is steady rather than torn—so peak pressure shows limited inner friction. The final gift/renunciation (“carried, not captured”) feels earned, if emotionally gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief-born vow and her choice to break it under Mira’s pressure are credible and moving; the blue ribbon and tools personalize motive. Interiority is concrete (trembling from memory, the lie about the bag), and the teaching moment reveals values under strain. The relationship dynamic is active and reshapes both characters (Mira learns; Elara yields tradition). Slight softness: mending proceeds a bit too smoothly, reducing felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The curator’s motive—to understand the shell and its provenance—drives clear micro‑choices (following coordinates, asking, retreating to the bathroom). Interiority is specific and embodied (boots, silver juice), with a credible contradiction between bewilderment and methodical training. The realization skirts a touch fast but is earned by the bathroom crucible and prior cues. Relationship pressure with the double self is brief yet catalytic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motives and competence are clear and drive every turn (opening the door, solving the loop‑trap, negotiating). Interiority is light—she rarely hesitates or reveals contradiction—so emotional cost reads more conceptual than felt. The “carefully resourceful” trait is shown (silver silk, dead languages), not merely told. The rescue of the time traveler offers a relational beat, but their dynamic is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s drive—proof versus release—is clear and intensifies, culminating in the choice to pocket the card and leave. Interiority is specific and embodied (fog altering memory, the card warming), avoiding therapy‑speak. The relationship crucible with Coraline is sharp and forces a values hierarchy. A hair’s breadth more contradiction-in-action under peak stress could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—translating confusion into a usable clarity—is consistent and embodied in tactile actions with the rope and seal. Competence reads persuasively; her micro-choices (which configuration to test, when to press the seal, stepping at the chime) align with pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; she feels calm mastery more than risk-fueled ambivalence. The final choice carries cost but her emotional texture remains controlled rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, embodied motive and competence under pressure (“finding the stress points where it wanted to yield”) ground her actions. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the path to success feels emotionally unruffled, limiting depth. The joints “protesting” hint at cost but do not meaningfully complicate choice. Character reads specific and lived-in, if a touch serene for the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motive and persistence are vivid, rooted in years of custodianship, and her micro‑choices (climb, align, accept “anti‑light”) align with that. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with the prism and pavilion. Internal contradiction is light—she’s largely steadfast rather than torn—so the arc reads more as endurance than contested change. The felt cost is mostly historic rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s motive—preserving and shaping collective identity—reads clear and character‑specific, and her choice to write with the summer‑quill emerges organically from her realization at the central crystal. Interiority is textured (“preemptively nostalgic”) and embodied through tactile engagement with crystals and weather. However, internal contradiction is light; she encounters little counter‑pressure on the page, making the final stance less a hard‑won trade‑off than a lucid acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaia’s motive—to transmute despair into communal wonder via craft—is clear and consistent, with concrete choices (teaching, repurposing materials, lighting the first device). Interiority is conveyed through the chant and sensory bias rather than labels, giving her a particular mind. Internal contradiction is modest; she moves from purpose to leadership without a real ethical or emotional snag. The relationship with the mosaic artist adds a light crucible but applies little pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s warmly observant stance and small, precise actions (turning, setting, then returning the cicada) read as tactical persuasion that aligns with her vocation. Chen’s fear of foresight is specific and felt, and his shift is believable. The relationship dynamic is delicately rendered through subtext rather than declarations. Minor limitation: Mira exhibits little overt contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motive (harvesting distinct “flavors” of silence to counter a bunker‑raised claustrophobia) is clear and drives concrete choices (refusing the tethered bed, staying on the deck, actively vialing hush). Interiority is specific to her history, and the doll connection to her grandmother personalizes risk. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she rarely falters once the inversion begins, so struggle feels low‑friction. The closing intention to bring a vial to her father reads earned, though the cost is largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marcus’s motive (ferrying as transformation) is clear and embodied through skilled micro-choices (speed, angle, terrace selection). His competence is vivid without lapsing into omniscience. Internal contradiction is light—he hints at a past wound but faces little pushback beyond calibrating the passenger’s distress. The passenger is legible but thin, serving as catalyst rather than a fully pressured foil.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, and Anya’s methodical choices (scanner, laser, peeling layers) reveal character. However, internal conflict is minimal; she meets little resistance and experiences a relatively smooth realization rather than a pressured reckoning. Emotions are mostly conceptualized rather than embodied under stress. The dissolving flake registers as a modest cost but doesn’t test her in a fraught moment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific motives (severed ties to serve this calling) and embodied choices (placing the shadow against her chest) reveal a credible inner life. The contradiction—tender caretaker who must also be absence—adds tension. However, she rarely falters; high competence smooths struggle, slightly lowering stakes on her micro-choices. The relationship pressure is one-sided (shadows), limiting crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motive is clean—redemption through alchemy of pressure—and her micro‑choices (descending, heeding/defying messages, turning the bolt) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete (“the cold metal grounding her”) and carries a credible contradiction (bitter/bright laugh). The final stance shift feels earned, though the “capstone” line tilts toward a tidy epiphany. Dr. Chen functions as light pressure rather than a crucible, keeping the focus on Marina.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Victoria’s desire to end the lineage’s predatory gift is clear and rooted in lived history; her ambivalence at the gramophone (“master the gift fully, or break the pattern”) gives a credible internal contradiction. Interiority is concrete—hand on the crank, the shift in the air, the felt relief of not knowing. The renunciation at the window reads earned and costly. Slightly summary‑tilted ancestral exposition softens peak pressure but doesn’t derail motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motive (ending exile by performing the oath) and embodied detail (“voice cracked,” blood seeds) ground Aldric, but internal conflict is minimal—he “knew what he must do” with little hesitation. The choice to take the puppet’s hand registers cost, yet contradictory impulses are muted. We glimpse his years learning the trees, but the pivotal moment lacks friction beyond awe. A stronger hesitation or competing value would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s motive is precise and embodied: access the archives to find his mother’s truth while curating a counter‑narrative of small graces. His micro‑choices (photographing the note, cross‑referencing addresses, returning the button, adding a name to his private index) reveal character under gentle pressure. The cost to intimacy (Sarah leaving) grounds his endurance as an earned stance. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy‑speak, with contradictions (solitude vs. need for witness) held in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive (preserving truth) drives clear, purposeful choices, and her competence is grounded in concrete actions (reading puddle‑maps, using the key, staging global uploads). However, interior contradiction is minimal; she faces little inner friction or hesitation under pressure. The line “anger without knowledge is just noise” is strong characterization but also declarative theme, slightly flattening complexity. The relationship with Jakob adds light pressure but doesn’t meaningfully transform her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s motive (hushing a spreading prophecy) is clear, embodied through specific acts of restraint and the inherited burden from his grandfather. Interiority is particular—dewdrops on brass, the “vested hush” settling—rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction is mild (purposeful non-performance vs. a musician’s impulse to play), limiting depth of struggle. The endurance choice at the end reads earned with a felt cost (future music foregone).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motive line is clear and character‑particular: a meticulous sorter who chooses curiosity over protocol, then embraces an inherited interpretive gift. The “report it vs. build monuments” tension appears but resolves quickly with limited on‑page struggle. Embodied emotion is vivid (tingling fingertips, moss fractals), and her altered priorities register credibly by the end. The cost of change (foreclosing her old role) is implied rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s curiosity and stubborn craft ethos evolve credibly into a renunciation of “fixing,” with micro‑choices (keeping the compass, suspending it, moving it to the greenhouse) revealing a shift in values. The internal turn is earned by observed phenomena, not fiat. Slight abstraction creeps in with label‑phrases (“uncertainly certain”), softening embodied emotion at peak beats. Still, the final refusal to repair visitors’ clocks reads like an earned stasis with a felt identity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s guilt-braided resolve and Mira’s self-disappointment are clear and embodied (gold seams on Vera’s cheek; Mira clutching the coin). Their motives align with choices that drive the ritual and the revaluation of the name. Interiority is vivid if a touch expository, and the epiphany lands slightly tidy. Still, the mentor–seeker dynamic under pressure feels credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s purpose and tactics are clear and consistent, and Thomas’s fear-to-release turn registers emotionally. However, Mara’s interiority is spare and largely functional; her “modestly fearless” stance rarely complicates choices. Thomas’s confession and shift feel a touch swift, limiting felt ambivalence at the peak. The closing acceptance is earned but lightly taxed.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is precise and embodied (angles, grams, vertebrae), with a credible contradiction between conditioned terror and chosen gentleness. Her decision to invert the strap’s fastening and to teach the child grows organically from earlier micro‑choices. A hair of over‑tidy articulation (“mathematics of mercy”) edges toward thesis, but action carries the turn. Cost remains present in persistent trauma and exile rather than erased.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to recover and revoice erased histories—is clear and particular, rooted in her gift and her grandmother’s legacy. Concrete micro-choices (accepting the palette knife, scraping the paint, deciding to act that night) align with her values. Internal contradiction is limited; the scene offers little resistance to test her resolve, so complexity stays modest. Valdric presses lightly but doesn’t force a charged relational pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s motives are clear and continuous—fixer’s intuition fused with a compulsion to attend to the dead—and his careful, tool‑true micro‑choices (dust reading, prying, climbing) reveal a precise hierarchy of values. Interiority stays embodied and specific (cables “singing,” the mainspring warming) without therapy‑speak. The guilt‑sunk ghost refracts his own burden, giving a subtle relational crucible without dialogue heaviness. The only softness: cost is mostly conceptual, not biting him on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Moth’s duty-bound rigor versus her compulsion to open the paradox bottle creates a credible internal crucible, with embodied choices (uncorking, setting “spaces” as type) revealing character under pressure. Motivation is consistent and intensifies as the library destabilizes. The final renunciation—allowing the system and self to dissolve—reads earned with visible cost. Minor abstraction in interiority never obscures her core impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cassia’s motives (failed revolutionary turned guardian of an extinct people) are clear and embodied; her rekindled fire against “protocols” plays credibly against her tempered sorrow. Interiority is particular (“poems she'd written in prison,” reading temporal currents like tactical maps) and actions align with stakes. The relationship dynamic with Huang is legible, with a status shift when he moves from refusal to curiosity. The cost and inner contradiction are present but soft; she faces little real risk on the page beyond moral defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive and method are clear and embodied through tactile craft; the lie‑induced “wilting” registers physically and pushes micro‑choices (measured speech, steadying hands). His solution grows from long preparation (mirrors installed over decades), showing competence under pressure. Internal contradiction is lighter—he rarely doubts or wavers—so the change reads as endurance rather than a fraught pivot. Councilor Vex is thin but functions as immediate pressure and status contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s motive (pursuit of petrichor/memory) is clear and consistently drives choices, culminating in a credible refusal to cross. Interiority is embodied (vials, mineral air, trembling fingers) and character‑specific (sensibly eccentric). The internal conflict between awe and caution surfaces at the hinge without melodrama. The cost of restraint is felt, though not deeply excavated.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marina’s craft-rooted interiority feels specific and embodied (grain, curve, rhythm) and her micro-choices (taking shelter, choosing a particular driftwood, carving guided by sensed presences) align with a coherent motive. The internal conflict is mild—there’s little resistance to the epiphany—so the change reads more acceptance than wrestle. Still, her renunciation of GPS reliance and embrace of the storm’s “turbine-hum” as compass land as a credible, earned stance shift. No relationship crucible on the page limits complexity, but within single-POV scope it works.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—decoding and honoring the postcards’ nocturnal truth—drives clear, specific actions (painting by candlelight, mixing amber resin, hiding the cards). Interiority is conveyed through tactile choices rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction is modest (desire for revelation vs. commitment to secrecy), but the final renunciation carries a quiet cost. The character reads particular (cathedral restoration past, pigment attention), not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amara’s motive (preserve truth without destroying a movement’s legacy) is clear and her micro‑choices—ordering the descent, arranging debris, choosing to transcribe—align under pressure. Interiority is specific enough (temporal vertigo, trembling hands) though it leans idealized and seldom exposes a sharp personal flaw or selfish impulse. The relationship with Marcus adds pressure and credibility to her choices. The cost lands more as principled burden than felt wound, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—revive the town without erasing its past—is clear and enacted through the key choice not to shatter the bottle. The internal contradiction (comfort of erasure vs bearing memory’s burden) is dramatized rather than merely stated. Interiority is specific (bottle to forehead; jellyfish light) though some lines tilt toward declarative summary. The cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally, but it coheres with his character.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Matthias’s vocation and compulsion are clear and embodied: he listens for the foghorn, tends the orchard, immerses the shaving, and labors through the night. His interiority is particular—languages as emotion spectra—and his choices (restore, transcribe, enshrine) align with that worldview. Contradictory pulls (archivist’s discipline vs. prophetic awe) are present without hand‑waving. The earned stasis at the end—acceptance and curation in the face of loss—carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motive—reopening and stewarding the vortex inheritance—is clear and embodied in careful, tactile actions. Her competence and “furiously tranquil” demeanor give specificity, but internal contradiction is slight and costs remain mostly conceptual. The grandmother’s protective act provides a counter‑pressure that Mira respects, yet she faces little on‑page resistance. The final choice feels earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, specific interiority grounds Mara’s choice—her preference for “listening over noise” is dramatized, not told, and culminates in choosing the bell over the switch. The contradictory impulses (modern system vs. tradition; clear skies vs. ominous readings) operate simultaneously. The cost is mostly reputational/credibility and remains implied rather than dramatized on the page. Still, her micro‑choices (kneeling, sensing vibration, selecting the bell first) reveal a coherent value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kepler-9’s motives and temperament are clear and coherent, with embodied beats like trembling fingers and the hand-written notes revealing values under pressure. The internal tension—seeing isolation as weakness versus a potential strength—builds toward an earned reframing. Micro-choices (adjusting the lens, abandoning computers for a notebook) credibly track the shift. Slight softness in contradiction depth keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and consistent—her learned caution and interpretive attention feel earned by history. The decisive endurance choice (to remain as keeper of silence) aligns with her traits and carries a visible cost of continued isolation. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (hunger for meaning versus the austerity of mute devotion), and could be sharpened to heighten pressure. Secondary presence (the grandfather’s ghost) functions as pressure rather than dialogue, which suits the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motivation and perceptual signature (feeling “the rough sandpaper of anxiety… the sticky tar of grief”) are vivid and consistent. His agency—choosing to gather fragments and become a bridge—emerges credibly from his status as a borrowed-time timekeeper. However, internal contradiction is mild; there’s little on-page struggle or cost in the moment of commitment. The piece privileges epiphany over pressure-tested micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives and worldview are clear and embodied through precise actions (catching the feather, retrieving the kite, reframing damage). Interiority feels particular rather than generic, with sensory bias consistent to a shoreline poet. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (yearning for wholeness vs. honoring fracture), so the pressure never forces a sharper, costlier renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s motives are clear and rooted in concrete tactics (the copper rigging, decision to confront trustees). Interiority feels specific to her craft and condition, but contradictory impulses are muted; she moves swiftly from shock to stewardship without much friction. The cancer-cost is present and ethically active, though her acceptance verges on effortless. Still, her choices align with her worldview and culminate in a credible renunciation of the trustees’ plan.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s luminous skepticism meets evidence in real time, producing credible inner tension that turns at the scanner moment. Her motivation—“the chemistry of homecoming”—is active and specific, not a label. Cost is mostly conceptual (identity, vocation reframed) rather than dramatized behaviorally, but it lands. Marcus functions as foil and pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular: reclaim the battlefield via hostile flora. Interiority is filtered through vocation (coachman, plague seasons), but internal contradiction is minimal and pressure is low. Micro-choices (where to plant, which seeds to use, when to leave) reveal values without melodrama. The renunciation at the end (leaving the garden to its own agency) reads earned, though the felt cost is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sage’s motivation is clear and particular—retired from tracking the dead, she’s drawn back by the child’s gift and the promise to “translate distance into closeness.” Her interiority is embodied (muzzle, failing eyes, bloodhound bones) and grounded in lived trauma without therapy‑speak. The agency shift—choosing to leave retirement and redefine her vocation—reads earned by ancestry and on‑page decoding. The only soft spot is a relatively smooth emotional passage through the journey with little friction shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira’s motivation—to guide the temporally scattered—flows cleanly from her identity as “blessed pariah,” and her choice to embrace that role feels earned. Interiority is specific (the rice paper, grandmother’s craft) and embodied through tactile contact with the compass. The internal conflict (isolation vs duty) is present but under-pressured on the page. Still, her renunciation of ordinary contact to become a fixed point registers as a credible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Renn’s motive—choosing wonder over certainty—is clear, embodied in tactile choices (the swaps) and a coherent thief‑ethos. Her courage is credible but the scene lacks much internal friction; she rarely doubts or falters, reducing felt struggle. The “sacredly playful” orientation manifests in action rather than label. Cost registers as the deliberate “destruction” of knowledge and the renunciation of her master’s path.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motive—becoming a historian of small gestures—is distinct and embodied through her walking‑words practice and refusal to serve spectacle. The crisis‑actor backstory creates credible pressure and a principled stubbornness (“benevolently ruthless”) that guides her choice. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: desire to witness colliding with public demand for testimony. The renunciation at the call’s arrival reads earned and reveals a value hierarchy with cost (isolation, refusal of legitimacy).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: reclaiming a buried self from the crushing weight of prophecy. Interiority is embodied and specific (soil ache, rain scent) with credible ambivalence between oracle and gardener. Micro‑choices—following the stone’s pull, refusing to seek visions, kneeling to plant—align with that tension. The cost of renouncing default prophecy‑seeking reads on the page without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaspar’s guilt-driven purpose is concrete and consistent, and his micro-choices (decoding the tapestry, pulling threads, leaving the coin) align with a credible drive toward self-forgiveness. Contradictory impulses—shame vs. duty—surface without therapy-speak. The recognition that he “did his best with incomplete knowledge” feels earned by the on-page work. Stakes are modest but legible, with a foreclosed path (endless self-condemnation) replaced by a costed acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s motive—shattering the Silencers’ monopoly on truth—is clear and consistently enacted through tactile choices (whispering, climbing, speaking into the chamber). Interiority is vivid if streamlined; she faces little internal contradiction or doubt in the moment. Cost is mostly conceptual (certain unforgiveness), not felt as a wrenching personal trade-off on the page. The “condemned artist” identity reads specific, though her competence is rarely strained.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motive—preserve meaning before collapse—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices (pressing the charm, holding position as the workshop tilts). She balances fear and determination credibly under a live clock. Internal contradiction is present but light (stubborn/broken vs. dutiful craft), yielding more purpose than friction. The final renunciation (life for the story) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied (“packed her supplies mechanically… like old love letters”), and her aloofness plays against a deep, private devotion to impermanence. Her choices—following the unfamiliar path, entering the cave, painting a new shell, deciding to keep the sanctuary—are motivated and reveal hierarchy of values. The contradictory impulses (seeking permanence vs. honoring passing; public quay vs. secret cave) co‑exist on the page. The final renunciation—keeping the cave secret while returning to the quay—reads as an earned endurance with subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s longing-driven agency is specific and embodied (the vial, the climb, the whispered absolution), and her months of refining “intentions” pay off in a decisive act. The internal contradiction—yearning to have him back while releasing the need to be protected—arrives credibly at “You don’t have to protect me anymore.” Emotional texture is concrete (scent, touch, light) rather than abstract labels. Minor softness: her flaw set is narrow, with little friction beyond grief.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s motives are urgent and specific—restore contact and shepherd the compelled return—and her embodied struggle (moon-weakened arms, leveraging the censer foot) reveals character under pressure. Contradictory impulses are present: her own pull to return versus the choice to stay and serve. Micro-choices in the calls (the child, Diego at the sulfur fields) expose values hierarchy with felt cost. The closing endurance/renunciation (“some of us are meant to stay”) is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives are distinct and embodied: a rational, desperate scientist-thief compelled to confess even to rain. The involuntary truth trait constrains action on the page and yields a credible, earned shift when the compulsion lifts. Internal contradiction (skeptical doubt versus hope; relief versus ethical burden) registers in micro‑choices. Slight neatness in the final moral stance keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Magnus’s interiority is specific and embodied, filtered through tactile engagement with objects and the sea. His investigative micro‑choices (timing the beam, reading scratches) reveal motive and flaw (compulsion to witness). The reveal about the son lands as an earned emotional contradiction—grief and relief braided. A small quibble: the leap to “son” is swift but supported by object history and genetic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marcus’s motives are coherent and rooted in his empirically intuitive nature and the grandfather’s promise; his micro‑choices (closing the shop, following the ants, pressing the chip, stepping through) track. Interiority is specific and embodied, with tactile attention to objects. The internal contradiction (comfort of stasis vs. latent yearning to begin) is present but lightly contested, making the decisive step feel a touch easy. The visible cost is mostly implied (abandoning safety), not deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Seraphina’s motive (duty vs. disenchantment) is clear and acts under pressure; micro-choices—dismissing the guard, touching the crystal, asking “What if I refuse?”, and stepping into transformation—track a credible arc. Interiority is specific and embodied (“roses bloomed backwards,” “silk across broken glass”) rather than labeled. The internal contradiction (rage against the crown vs. responsibility to the realm) remains active through the choice. Slight idealization persists—she accepts the sacrifice with minimal visible struggle at the brink.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyra’s drive (“capture the density of presence”) is specific, rooted in family legacy, and her pivot to “revalue everything” reads motivated by Marcus’s pressure and the shell’s significance. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with the nexus and shell, not abstract labels. The relationship functions as a crucible—Marcus’s quiet observation triggers her decisive reframing. The only softness is a slightly tidy mutual affirmation (“Presence needs witness”) that edges toward statement over dramatized ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct interior conflict—envy of other Mayas versus weary acceptance—animates concrete micro‑choices (returning to write, then stepping outside to “fall”). Motivation (to distill chaos into narrative) is consistent and pressurized by the grave vision and the archive of selves. Emotions are embodied (“forehead against the cold glass,” “bark peeling” laugh), not merely labeled. The closing endurance/renunciation—accepting chaos while continuing to chronicle—carries a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied—she “reads time through touch and sound,” and her micro‑choices (cleaning the screw, fitting it deliberately loose) align with her history and values. The relationship with Mrs. Huang contains charged subtext and a credible status dynamic. A minor neatness in how Mara completes the unsaid (“Before she couldn’t save her own”) edges toward authorial foreknowledge but is motivated by her practiced translation. The final endurance—choosing honest, imperfect time—lands with felt cost and consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kira’s motives and contradictions are vivid: ambition versus shame, scholarship versus superstition, breath‑holding against panic. Embodied stress via crystallizing skin grounds emotion and choice. Micro‑choices (counting marks, reinterpreting “boi,” tracing scars) earn the final act. The epiphany lands slightly neatly, but it’s motivated by accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s motives and flaws are clear: pride and certainty give way to actionable remorse, culminating in the choice to collaborate and bear cost. Interiority is specific (scent, paper, the sting of her past headline) and her apology becomes action. Marcus and Elisabetta apply direct relational pressure that forces Vera’s stance shift. Minor neatness in her self-awareness trims edge but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaia’s motive—resolve/endure the universe’s “hiccup” by unraveling the illusion of opposition—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (following etymologies, initiating arbitration, reading “Unify,” seeding the lexicon) align. Interiority is textured and particular to her lexicon‑sensibility. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she transitions to understanding with minimal friction, which softens felt cost. The arc lands, but the ease of her mastery reduces the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motivation (to test what clocks really measure) guides embodied actions (whistle, countdown, logging). The grandmother’s bequest personalizes her drive and frames the ritual with credible inheritance. Internal contradiction is light—endurance over conflict—yet the “bridge between two kinds of time” realization reads earned. Emotional cost is mostly solitude/peculiarity rather than a sharp on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s vocation, habits, and flaw (building walls) motivate her attention and choices; the discovery tightens an internal conflict that culminates in the risky call to Chen. Emotions are embodied via the laser habit, the spongy substrate, and the “familiar strangers” lens. The cost is emotional vulnerability, legible if quiet. A touch of direct statement (“They’d shown her something personal”) softens the edge of interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied—her father’s gambling and her career grind against each other and drive the choice to join the society by writing a message. Interiority is specific (mica panes, interference patterns) rather than generic labels. The turn to acceptance is a touch quick, with minimal visible resistance or price paid on the page. Still, the final action credibly arises from prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s motive—“cultivating estrangement”—is specific and drives his choices, especially his refusal to correct Eleanor. His contradictory impulse (to comfort while preserving distance) is dramatized in withholding the truth and in using the glass disc to tint his voice. Earned Stasis lands: he recommits to isolation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motives are precise and layered—mercy for Eleanor versus accountability for Thomas—and her micro-choice to add a hidden codicil embodies that contradiction. Embodied details (walnut-stained fingers, breath steeping like tea) ground emotion. The final renunciation/acceptance (preserving the covenant while recording the erased names) reads earned with visible cost. Minor safety in phrasing avoids deeper messiness, but the internal conflict is credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sadie’s motive set—engineering reciprocity through rumor and trade—reads specific and coherent, with the “mask slipping” moment adding human contradiction. Marcus is thinner but legible: lonely, yearning to matter, and his micro‑choice to surrender the heirloom carries cost. Status play (thermos as offering; Sadie’s mock‑sincere bow) is crisp. The emotional interior leans declarative at times, but actions align cleanly with motives.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (seek the stillpoint to refine her emotional cartography) is clear and her actions align. Interiority is textured through tactile/sonic perception, but contradictory impulses or visible on‑page cost are minimal. The shift to “becoming the destination” reads earned, if serene rather than hard‑won. The piece favors poise over conflict, limiting depth of micro‑choice pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s guilt, professional rigor, and temptation toward absolution create credible, simultaneous cross‑pressures. The fountain pen as a talisman grounds her interiority and reveals values under stress. Her final act—transmitting both coordinates—fits her “confidently uncertain” nature without feeling evasive. Minor abstraction in explaining the anomaly slightly distances embodied emotion at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s ritual with the empty Leica, arthritic signing, and decades‑long project ground her motives with specificity; Chen’s presence presses and enables without stealing focus. The relationship is textured—advisor, interpreter, friend—and choices emerge from that bond (“Show me the map,” working until dawn). Interiority is embodied rather than labeled, with contradiction (grief/hope) carried through action. A touch of expository backstory verges on summary, but it still charges present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s motivation is vivid and specific—burning forgeries to defend a buried truth—and her tactile “volcanic tenderness” grounds emotion in body. However, internal contradiction is limited; she rarely wavers or struggles on the page, and micro‑choices under pressure are minimal beyond deciding to study the weave. The isolation cost and self‑recrimination read, but they’re largely asserted rather than dramatized. Still, the fusion of forensic acuity and ancestral pull feels character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motive—quiet compliance masking a subversive plan—is clear and sustains credible, character‑particular choices. Her embodied experience (“injection burned cold,” heartbeat syncing to flowers) grounds the interiority. The contradiction between acquiescence and rebellion is active on the page. A minor limit: she meets little on‑page resistance beyond Dr. Chen’s abort attempt, so struggle feels slightly smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s competence, history, and motive are clear and embodied through map‑work, gait recognition, and the tapping key. His calm persistence against prior dismissal gives him dimension, and the social dynamic with Chen registers in status shifts (“You win”). Internal contradiction is light—resentment is implied but never truly tests him on the page. The final renunciation (giving the coin) reads motivated and closes a path.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motive and method (teaching without words through light and shadow) are precise and embodied; Thomas’s burden is particular and tracked into release. The micro‑choices—shutter by shutter, puddle by puddle—externalize interior change credibly. Some interior conclusions (“love spoken in actions echoes longer…”) ride close to summary rather than dramatized contradiction. Still, the renunciation of the need for final words feels earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motive—to seed critical thinking through chess—is clear and consistent, with Elena providing a live relational crucible. He comforts, plans, and risks exposure; his gift for hearing unspoken words feeds his tactics. However, he experiences little internal contradiction under pressure, so the arc leans assured rather than conflicted. A few didactic lines (“I am teaching overthrow…”) skim toward thesis rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motives are clear and embodied: survival-learned grace versus the prison of disguise, culminating in the concrete act of unbinding. Her contradictory impulses (evasion and longing) play on the page, and Torven’s “combative tenderness” adds pressure and recognition without romance. The final renunciation (leaving clothes, diving) forecloses a life with felt cost. Slight neatness to the epiphany keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mrs. Chen’s desire to carry grief under the Mandate is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (offering the bouquet, touching the brittle petal, practicing the monotone). The performer’s neutrality creates a credible crucible without false villainy. Contradictory impulses—memory vs survival under enforced cheer—are dramatized rather than declared. The final stance (embracing the technique’s cost) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    Silas’s motive is clear and specific—return to the atrium to complete a forbidden transformation—but internal conflict is minimal and the piece offers little resistance beyond remembered banishment. Interiority is textured (“his body became ink”), yet he meets no meaningful counter‑pressure that forces a trade‑off. The arrival of others adds community but not character strain. The final understanding feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motives and methods are clear and character‑particular: her colorblind perception informs concrete micro‑choices (the herb arrangement) that pressure Enzo credibly. The relationship dynamic carries status shifts (her leverage via subtext) without grandstanding. A touch of aphoristic neatness (“The phoenix didn’t just destroy…”) slightly softens the messiness of emotion. Still, the emotional throughline from barter to quiet care is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete and character‑particular: the miner’s lens, muscle memory at the bells, and the pivot from ritual to improvisation reveal motive and flaw (compliance vs. authorship). Her micro‑choices escalate from peering through the lens to breaking sequence, to accepting communal response. The change is earned and forecloses the old script with implied institutional cost. Slight safety remains: the decision faces minimal resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s grief, craft, and tentative self‑renewal are embodied in concrete choices (folding cranes, reshaping a ring, sterilizing the needle but deferring the tattoo). Her contradictory impulse—designing a phoenix for herself yet hesitating—feels specific and earned. The interaction with the grieving woman reveals values and status with restraint, not therapy‑speak. The final endurance/renunciation (Charged Poise) carries a felt cost without neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s professional drive and method are clear and consistent, and her decision to “confide” the trading‑pattern link gives her agency. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she operates mostly from competence rather than pressure. The relationship with Marcus adds light, credible pressure but doesn’t force a fraught trade‑off. Emotional embodiment is vivid via setting and tools, yet the on‑page cost to Vera remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—seventeen years training to defeat pattern‑tracking and to neutralize the memory plague—and actions align under pressure (erratic traversal, shattering the vessel, inhaling). Interiority is embodied through sensory invasion (“the texture of extinct fruit,” “weight of watching stars die”). The final renunciation (self‑sacrifice as living filter) is earned and carries visible cost. Slight shortfall in contradictory impulses; she feels anguish and awe but rarely vacillates in purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motive is clear and sustained: to understand the shadow and decide what to preserve. Her agency is concrete (activating the interface, placing the stone, choosing to tend shadows), and the embodied “luminous regret” lands. Internal contradiction is mild—there’s little friction beyond grief and duty—but it suits the length. Secondary pressure (colleagues’ dismissal) remains off‑page, limiting crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—protecting the animal vs. exploiting it to save the sanctuary—are embodied in precise actions (removing bio‑chips, reattaching the tail, composing a public confession). Interiority is specific and avoids therapy‑speak; the admission “I was using your pain to save myself” lands because it’s earned by the surgery beat. Micro‑choices under pressure (continuing the delicate procedure despite looming ruin) reveal a clear values hierarchy. The final renunciation (confession and acceptance of consequences) forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s compulsion to reopen scars is embodied (bandaged hands, post‑op unsteadiness) and drives her choices to read marks and stand at the window. The realization that her wounds are “invitation” not “injury” earns a credible stance shift with a felt cost: choosing to remain open. Interiority is specific (coffee ring, root‑whispers) and avoids therapy‑speak. Slightly idealized clarity at the end trims the edge of contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s motive (professional duty vs. reverence for “unused love”) is clear and coherently escalates toward her decision to take the film. Interiority is specific and embodied (cool brass, “tasting silver and salt”), with a credible overwhelm. The final choice forecloses a path—she keeps a sacred artifact, violating the job’s implicit boundaries. A touch more on the practical risk or reluctance would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra’s motive and worldview are clear and embodied (the astrolabe as tether; “shadowed rapture”). However, internal contradiction is light: she moves from purpose to surrender with minimal on‑page resistance, so the choice reads inevitable rather than contested. The “sanity and divine madness” frame is strong but not dramatized into competing impulses in scene. Still, actions align with her aims and reveal character reliably.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kess’s motive (guard and cultivate future dreaming) is clear and consistent, and her dreamless state gives her a credible internal cost. Interiority is vivid and character‑specific, not generic. Contradiction (the dreamless tending dreams) hums under the scene, though it could pinch harder in the confrontation. The key choice—singing to force reality to select her version—aligns with her values and history.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear—recover untamed thought and memory—and his choices (entering the forest’s heart, placing the gear, vowing a nightly return) align. Interiority is particular and embodied through his reading of the forest’s “language.” Internal contradiction is mild; he rarely hesitates or pays an acute emotional price in-scene. The final vow suggests endurance with cost (he must leave each dawn), but the conflict stays mostly contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s motive (control vs. release) is clear and embodied through the leash/dog pursuit and her confession. Micro-choices—stepping into the boat, admitting fear, accepting the star‑punched ticket—earn the shift. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy‑speak. The guides function as calm pressure rather than gurus, keeping her change credible with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s motive—staying to understand the cost of silence—drives concrete micro‑choices (keeping the bolt, noticing the worn step, handing the bolt to Elena). Embodied details (nerve tingling, frostbite) ground his interiority. Elena’s brief appearance carries credible history and visible cost (scars), though her thesis‑like line edges toward on‑the‑nose. The final stance—choosing when to offer sound—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Syln’s motive—guarding truth over power—is clear and consistent, and her agency culminates in the decisive act of dropping the pellet. Interiority is economical but specific (ink‑making, attention to scripts), giving her a lived texture. Contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers, which limits complexity. The status dynamic with the pretender is crisp but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s drive—to reconcile the atlas and her grandmother’s margins with what she sees—is clear and expressed through embodied habits (the tapping, instrument checks). The generational thread gives her interiority specificity. However, the leap from patterned shadows to “metamorphosis” reads swift and nearly unopposed, with little contradictory impulse or costed doubt on the page. The final decision to dive is motivated but not wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s interiority is specific and embodied (bare feet, the hum in her sternum), and her motive—to find a new way to wake the sleepers—tracks cleanly. The “awkwardly confident” trait appears in motion but rarely constrains a choice with cost. Contradictory impulses are limited; once she recognizes the lull as an inhale, the path ahead carries little friction. The final stance shift is earned but soft on visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Chen’s motives are clear and consistent—she trusts plant-whispers over Authority and acts decisively to unseal the amber. Interiority tracks through tactile actions (mixing minerals, decoding the kite) rather than labels. However, there’s little on‑page ambivalence or contradictory impulse; she rarely hesitates, which trims depth. Secondary characters apply pressure but do not alter her choices meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Amira’s motives and contradictions are precise: panic rising versus the disciplined choice to “freeze,” grief against the stubborn act of cultivation. Embodied emotion is vivid via somatic markers and tactile contact with the cedar. Her micro‑choices (replanting, carrying the photograph, returning tomorrow) align with an Earned Stasis resolution. Minor therapy‑lexicon (“somatic markers,” named clinician) risks clinical tint but is grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s motivation (recovering an artistic self under a reality that won’t hold still) is clear and intensified by concrete pressures. Her interiority is specific—charcoal from the dead beacon, glass falling upward, “three faces”—and her contradictory impulses (grief for the old way vs. necessary descent) play simultaneously. The redesign choice is earned by prior beats with a felt cost (“cracked and luminous with grief”). Minor reliance on rhetorical questions doesn’t undercut the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive and a distinct internal texture (“serene anger”) drive concrete choices (the ink trap, working against the eclipse clock). The transformation from anger to understanding lands, though the felt cost is modest. Interiority is particular to her methodology rather than generic. Limited contradictory impulses on the page keep the arc strong but not exquisite.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vera’s competing loyalties (oath vs truth) are dramatized through concrete micro-choices—the five-point biometric gauntlet, triggering the cascade failure—and culminate in a costly commitment. Interiority is specific and embodied (breath fog, gloved palm, steady pulse) rather than abstract labels. Her competence under pressure never erases conflict; the “terrible peace” at the end reads as earned stasis with visible cost. A hairline gap is the relative ease of her execution under active threat; a moment of stumble or near‑abort could further deepen character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives (pacifist cultivation as antidote to her father’s violence) are clear and embodied; the father’s deliberate sheathing and willingness to learn reads as a credible, if modest, change. Interiority is filtered through tactile plant work rather than abstract labels. The relationship functions as a crucible without melodrama. The cost is largely symbolic, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kova’s motive is clear and sustained, and her calm discipline under stress (voicing silence while her “heart hammered”) yields strong, embodied interiority. Contradictory impulses surface via the ice‑bell fear she ignores, showing credible micro‑choices. The transformation—echo fusing with her voice—reads earned, though the on‑page cost is subtle rather than biting.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margot’s conflicting drives—to uncover truth and to shield her empire—are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (writing a proof, then crafting misdirection). The embodied details (nib’s shadow tracing ellipses, the “goodbye kiss to honesty”) reveal a specific psyche under pressure. Her pivot to the Tokyo lie reads as a credible, morally costly renunciation. Only slight neatness in the telegram‑proxy deduction keeps this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive (“to tether the haunted firmware to something physical”) is clear and sustained, and her competence is specific and embodied through tools and sensory perception via the amber. Internal contradiction is limited—she rarely wavers—so the emotional complexity leans more toward reverent craft than fraught choice. Still, micro‑choices (approach, lensing, translation into constellation) reveal values under pressure. The visible cost—the amber cracking—grounds the outcome in character consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Seraphina’s drive to impose order via the mandala versus her learned acceptance of “the mess” creates a credible, felt arc. Interiority is particular (chalk-stained fingers, reading the grotto’s “anxious” curves) and avoids stock labels. The cost lands as a renunciation—leaving the mandala to be scattered and refusing to fix meaning. Slight softness remains around concrete consequences beyond the conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sarai’s motive—aberrant mercy complicated by guilt—drives concrete micro‑choices (placing tesserae despite painful visions). Her contradiction (compelled by the past yet choosing to repurpose it) is embodied in “strange, cold warmth.” Dialogue with the old man sharpens her stance without flattening her. A few lines edge toward thesis (“mercy isn’t about purity”), but the interior turn earns her final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cornelius’s longing for Isabella and for an “encore” is clear, embodied through synesthetic sensations that guide his choices. His actions—claiming the coin, speaking/singing to braid time—align with that motive. The relationship beat with Isabella lands, but internal contradiction and genuine struggle are light, with little resistance once the coin activates. The cost of choosing eternal performance is implied rather than wrestled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and embodied via “somatic markers,” giving her interiority a concrete, character‑specific texture. The relationship dynamic with David applies credible, immediate pressure, though his skepticism melts quickly, limiting struggle. Actions align with motives, and the final stance—turning the studio into a laboratory—feels earned. Internal contradiction is mild; she’s largely assured rather than torn.

    Kira’s vocation and sensory modifications yield a distinctive interiority, and her micro‑choices (following the amber joy, adjusting the harness, approaching the alien signature) track cleanly. The turn from “documenting” to “becoming a translator/teacher” is motivated by her encounter and the fossil’s crumbling. However, conflict remains largely frictionless—little contradiction or risk pushes against her competence. Emotional embodiment is strong but rarely messy, limiting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive is clear and evolves credibly from archival maintenance to active shaping of futures. Interiority is vivid but skews abstract; embodied contradiction and felt cost are light. Key choices (pairing the echo with the black hourglass, arranging buttons, opening the jar) align with her traits. The shift reads earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margot’s motives (betrayal, survival, and a need to “fix what was broken”) are clear and her final choice is credible. The confrontation with Viktor gives us controlled anger versus duty, but internal contradiction under pressure is resolved a bit too cleanly and quickly. Embodied emotion is solid (frozen rock, weight of the pillbox), though the psychological cost could cut deeper. Relationship dynamics register but don’t truly shift beyond the mission handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thomas’s purpose and method are distinct and grounded in long habit; his offer to “ease” rather than erase shows ethical calibration. The woman is sketched efficiently through the “shadow” of a broken promise, but her interiority is minimal. There’s little contradiction or struggle in Thomas—serenity under a ticking clock, not a conflict. The closing endurance (work ends when gutters stop) reads credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei’s motive—to understand why the oasis resists fracture—is clear and action-aligned (the trek, the handling of the glass, the observant waiting). The potter’s sensibility provides character‑particular interiority that colors perception and choices. However, inner contradiction is minimal; she rarely faces a competing impulse or cost on the page beyond endurance. The ending’s renunciatory calm (leaving with the answer) reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina’s motive—letting go to make space for new growth—is consistent, concrete, and embodied through specific acts (bringing the gauge to the dock, wedging it into the planks). The heirloom’s relinquishment carries a felt cost tied to her grandfather. Contradictory impulses (attachment vs. release) register quietly but credibly. The struggle is contemplative rather than combative, but still earns the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kira’s motivation—to transmute isolation into independence—is clear, character‑specific, and culminates in a credible internal shift when she reframes her role (“We weren’t preserved to recreate the past…”). Interiority is textured through embodied cues (the hum in her sternum, the sundial’s warmth). The change is earned, though the epiphany lands a touch neatly, with little visible counter‑pull beyond loneliness. Marcus adds light relational pressure without diluting her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motives are clear and character‑specific (rejoining, pattern‑finding, reconciling with Chen), and her embodied attention to tools and light grounds emotion. The relationship pressure is present but gentle; Chen’s quick acceptance softens friction. Interiority is consistent and avoids therapy‑speak, though the resolution feels tidy. The final hand‑taking earns a modest change without showing much visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent, with tactile interiority (“burnt coffee,” “trembling fingers”) and concrete micro‑choices (using analog gear, calibrating counter‑frequencies). Her competence feels earned and drives outcomes. Internal contradiction is present but light—“cautiously hopeful” rarely complicates her actions under pressure. The arc ends in credible endurance rather than deep change, with modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s contradiction—“prudently adventurous” and claustrophobic—drives concrete micro‑choices (breathing control, route memorization, reliance on tools) and colors perception throughout. His embodied fear is present without melodrama, and the music’s pull tests it credibly. The closing reorientation (boundaries as redrawable) feels earned by what he endures, though the on‑page cost is modest. A live relational crucible is absent, but not required at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sarah’s methodical tactility, prosopagnosia, and portrait process create a distinct interiority and drive credible choices (easel placement, charcoal sequencing, phone call). The tension between her sensory mapping and the world of masks reads specific and embodied. Internal contradiction is lighter—she rarely struggles against her own motives—so the emotional price remains subdued. Still, her tremor before the final portrait and the cost of working without evidence ground an earned, if quiet, endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—honoring and completing Lydia’s covert mission—drives concrete choices (decoding, refusing evacuation, broadcasting). Interiority is specific (“spongey dread…wet wool”) and contradicts action in a credible way as certainty hardens under pressure. Her micro‑choices with the nail and map table reveal priorities without safety‑hedging. The only minor shortfall is limited on‑page cost to her relationships or self‑image beyond the declared responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marla’s interior is specific and embodied—reading winds like sheet music, clutching the collodion shard—and her decisive act (playing the melody backward) is motivated by the newfound decoding. Contradictory impulses—guilt and guardedness versus granting amnesty—surface through images rather than labels. The final acceptance of responsibility (ferryman of forgiveness) feels earned, though the emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Status dynamics with the hitchhiker are light but present in his mentoring/fading stance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motive—nonviolent deterrence to expose circular traps—is clear and consistent, and his tactics reveal character under pressure. The brief exchange with Chen credibly reframes both men without grandstanding. Internal contradiction is subtle (guardian vs. saboteur), leaning more toward earned stasis than transformation. A touch more embodied ambivalence in Marcus at the meeting would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motives (to decode, to carry the burden without breaking) are coherent and enacted through specific choices—sharing the telegram, aligning the star pulse, reframing their role from prophet to witness. Internal contradiction is light; she bears strain but rarely wavers, and Hayashi applies minimal counter‑pressure. Still, her micro‑choices (pressing the flower to the brass, adding the memory card) reveal values through action. The emotional register is steady and embodied enough without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motive (clear the bloodline and save the order) is coherent and he acts decisively under pressure. Interiority is specific (“warlike serenity,” guarded expression) but internal contradiction is light, with little felt friction beyond competence. The final stance—choosing to carry a hated legacy to save the realm—reads earned, though the emotional cost is mostly conceptual. A sharper on‑page price or a moment of doubt would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivations (root-bound anchor, purposeful curiosity) are clear and embodied through tactile choices—pressing the clipping, tracing scars, touching the brightest wound. Contradictory impulses (fear vs curiosity) surface at the climax but the struggle is relatively smooth. The “anchor” acceptance reads earned, though lightly priced. More friction or a costed renunciation would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—patching the Elena‑shaped hole—drives every choice, and her flaw (reckless fixing) is confronted by the keeper’s pushback at the tree. The inner contradiction (trammeling her own fate vs. honoring Elena’s) is dramatized rather than summarized. The decision to bite the apple credibly forecloses the path of a singular, self‑determined destiny. Emotional texture is embodied through tactile objects (card heat, phosphorescent fruit) rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s interiority is particular, embodied, and contradictory—his “confidently uncertain” patter masks shame even as his hands and ear stay exacting. The micro‑choice to stop cataloging and truly “see the cloth” earns the later phone call. The cost is reputational risk and the surrender of defensive objectivity. Slight softness remains in how sharply that risk bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sarah’s motivation is clear and character‑specific—her kindly, methodical temperament underwrites both the translation work and her willingness to shoulder the inheritance. The core conflict (quiet scholarly detachment vs. accepting a burdened legacy) is credible and culminates in a decisive choice with a felt cost. Some emotional beats tilt toward exposition rather than embodied contradiction, but the internal stakes still register. Her micro‑choices (plucking, holding, then consuming the seed) track cleanly with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaine’s motive—preserve wonder and guide seekers—is clear and embodied in specific acts (handing over the creel, supervising the furnace). Her contradiction (machine/flesh; keeper/story) informs micro‑choices and perception. The visitor is purposeful but thinly drawn; pressure on Kaine never forces a painful trade‑off on the page. The final endurance feels earned though the cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, specific interiority drives credible micro‑choices (reading, etching, texting, leaving the pearl). Contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus the urge to confess—act simultaneously at the knife beat. The change (choosing connection and accepting cost) is earned by prior pressure from the etched confessions. A few lines verge on thesis‑speak, but they’re grounded by concrete acts.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s motives are coherent and embodied: the ivy, the bellows, and the graffiti all refract a guilt‑driven compulsion to document. The contradiction—methodical science vs. paralyzing remorse—surfaces in the Wheaton Bridge memory and culminates when he draws himself failing. The renunciation of map‑making at the end feels earned by the prior beats. A touch of therapy‑speak (“therapy sessions,” numbing meds) brushes the edge of label, but it’s grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear (seek and decode the library) and enacted through concrete micro-choices (slowing down to document, reading the watch, engaging the librarian). Interiority is particular (“cautious exuberance”) but internal conflict is light; she meets little resistance and seldom pays an emotional price. The identity shift (seeker → keeper) reads earned but largely frictionless. A sharper felt cost or contradictory impulse on the page would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s ambition versus integrity is sharply drawn and tested under pressure, with concrete micro‑choices (forging papers; letting Marcus touch the violin) revealing her hierarchy of values. Interiority is specific (coffee stains, jasmine whispers) and embodied rather than labeled. The renunciation of her “academic empire” lands as a felt cost tied to prior beats. Marcus functions as a credible relational pressure that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—her dual craft (beautician/mortician) coheres with the goal to preserve the “last spark.” Interiority is present but mostly in service of atmosphere rather than conflicted choice, so ambivalence remains thematic more than felt. Micro‑choices (measured breath, hiding movement within aurora) reveal values under pressure. The final stance (choosing liminality) reads earned but lightly priced emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive (a disturbed morning and longing for contentment) is clear and embodied through ritual action (fastening the hairpin, climbing the oak). Her interiority is particular and grounded in sensory memory (vineyard, jade pin), though the epiphany arrives somewhat smoothly via the mentor figure. Contradictory impulses are muted; serenity dominates with limited friction beyond regret over the scrolls. The final renunciation/acceptance reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Arbiter’s motive (to usher nuance) and Marcus’s guilt are clear and consistent, with status dynamics legible in their exchanges. Micro-choices—reading the chimes, angling the shard, the blunt “You killed her with simplicity”—reveal character under pressure. The Arbiter veers toward aphorism at times, but embodied specifics (rice‑paper questions, wind, chimes) keep it grounded. Marcus’s internal contradiction (self‑protection vs. accountability) is credible if underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (teaching through experience, guarding a dangerous truth) is clear and consistent, and Marcus’s dawning recognition gives a modest relational crucible. Interiority is lyrical and character‑specific, though internal contradiction/cost is lightly sketched rather than felt. Her withholding reads as a principled flaw that shapes tactics. The emotional register stays serene, limiting pressure-based revelation of character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yula’s motivation—mastery through stillness—feels specific and earned, with the cost of centuries embodied in dust and endurance. Her micro-choices (pressing the arrowhead to her sternum, syncing breath/heart to the pulse) align with her traits and escalate commitment. The internal contradiction (youthful movement vs. aged stillness) is dramatized rather than summarized. A slight remove remains—no acute moment of doubt undercuts her poise—which keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motives and contradictions are clear: shame and inadequacy versus a stubborn appetite for meaning. The medallion drop and the decision to step onto mist translate interior pressure into embodied choice. Interiority stays specific (machines “painting symphonies,” the keystone’s human roughness) rather than generic therapy-speak. The epiphany lands slightly tidy, but it’s earned by earlier renunciations.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marlow’s motive (to find Elena’s journal and “the color of sound”) is clear and drives each beat to the ritual. Interiority is specific and embodied through synesthetic perception rather than labels. The final acceptance of the luminous vows forecloses her former hiding, though the felt cost remains subtle. Absence of on‑page interpersonal pressure limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voss’s motive—aligning with a purpose she’ll only know after enacting it—reads cleanly and coheres with her ritual acts (casting, pressing palms to amber). Quiet enthusiasm versus “stellar doubt” gives a credible internal tension. Embodied specifics (warm amber, coins’ orbits) ground the abstraction, though affect skews conceptual more than visceral. The acceptance of an eternal role carries felt cost but remains more intellectual than bodily.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    A precise, embodied interior drives the piece: the reaper’s wound (erasure after sacrifice) shapes her micro‑choices (climbing, unfolding the atlas, naming the monsters). Contradictory impulses—duty versus the ache of being unseen—coexist rather than alternate. The naming beat reveals character under pressure and earns the endurance that follows. A minor softness: her plan to “make her own recording” is told rather than dramatized as a charged choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and particular—restore the fish by re‑voicing a bell—and her choices under pressure are consistent with her modest power. Embodied details (palms on stone, exhaustion, burned savings) ground her. Internal conflict is limited; she largely believes and perseveres without a fraught contradictory impulse on the page. Still, the cost (social alienation, physical depletion) reads and the final stance feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s vigilance, memory-pricked curiosity, and ethical pivot from bureaucratic witness to moral witness are clear and grounded in concrete actions (the breadcrumb photos, the retrieval of Elena’s picture). Interiority is specific—childhood fragments sharpen into a present-tense obligation. The internal tension between job remit and truth-telling is present if quiet. The final resolve to name Elena feels earned rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s motive—to recover wonder to complete the Synthesis—is consistent and sharpened by the choice to preserve or release the crystal. Interiority is specific (starlings as “conversation”), with a credible tug-of-war between laboratory control and intuitive risk. The final act (sublimating the crystal) forecloses a path with a felt cost. A hint more embodied stress at the moment of decision could deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motives and contradictions are clear: corporate duty vs. witness-ethic, culminating in a risky lie and the choice to share hidden data. Embodied details (parachute buckle habit, muscle-memory) reveal her under pressure. A touch more fraying at the edges (physiological stress or error) could deepen cost. Still, the micro-choices feel earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s numbness is rendered with concrete specificity (“terrifies the part of me that still remembers terror”), and his final decision emerges credibly from the scene’s pressure. The internal contradiction—impossibly flat affect paired with remembered fear—creates real torque. Small slips into therapy-speak (“trauma victims,” “numbness”) slightly genericize the interiority. The on‑page micro‑choices (accepting the sword, lowering it, lifting the jar) reveal a hierarchy of values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s motive and skillset are crisply established and her choices (venturing out, planting under time pressure, returning nightly) align with her identity. Interiority is textured via tactile details (trembling hands, the heat of the seed), but true internal contradiction is faint and she meets limited resistance. The “teach others” mandate at the end signals change, yet the cost of that commitment remains mostly conceptual. A stronger on‑page test of fear or compromise would deepen character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s motive is precise and embodied—“mournfully eager” fits the ritualistic, repairing impulse—and his actions align with it beat by beat. The internal friction (grief vs. duty) hums but never spikes into a pressured contradiction on the page. Secondary figures are off‑stage, so relational crucible isn’t tested. The earned endurance at the end (he’ll return monthly) reads credible and paid for in quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is vivid and embodied: homesickness and feral adaptation contend with duty. Micro-choices (revealing herself, surrendering the pendant, choosing to leave) align with those pressures. The internal contradiction—guardian versus exile yearning—feels lived rather than declared. Slight softness: the trust leap with the scholar faces minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motive and flaw are clear and embodied: a meticulous, long-dismissed alchemist willing to risk heresy to prove a new path. His micro-choices (stealing the crozier, choosing transformation over restoration, adding blood) align with a consistent worldview. Interiority is specific (“carry his sensitivity like armor”), though internal contradiction is mild—he rarely wavers once the scene begins, limiting friction. The closing identity shift reads earned with a felt social and spiritual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and competence anchor Maya’s motive; her choice to refuse Guild monetization reads earned by prior discoveries. However, internal conflict is light—she faces little friction besides the clock and environment, so contradictory impulses rarely spark on the page. Embodied moments (tingling fingers, swaying cables) help, but struggle feels largely contemplative rather than pressured. The renunciation at the end lands but with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motive—collecting moments to enable a convergence—is clear and enacted; his resilient optimism reads particular and consistent. Internal contradiction is light (he’s “ardent for escape” earlier vs. acceptance at the end) and the struggle feels mostly frictionless on the page. The hourglass shattering and his choice to remain deckhand provide a credible cost. Secondary character pressure (the flickering woman) serves as mirror more than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is coherent (to discover “the texture of connection”), and the fever/calm duality gives her interiority a specific tension. Agency is present in maintaining balance and choosing to complete the weave and leave. However, the on‑page cost to her personally remains abstract; we don’t witness a pressured trade‑off beyond exhaustion/thread depletion. The internal conflict seldom crystallizes into a hard choice with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s professional motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her small choices (pressing the chain link, structuring the lesson, staying to “witness”) reveal character. Interiority skews toward awe over conflict, with little contradictory impulse or visible cost. Relationship pressure is light; the Depth Dweller reassures rather than tests her stance. The ending offers an earned, reflective poise rather than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive—protecting vulnerable voices—drives clear micro‑choices (listening, interpreting, pursuing), and her reluctant‑hero contradiction gives her interiority texture. Embodied perception (copper taste, tremble of orchids) grounds emotion without label‑speak. The “hadn’t meant to be a hero” admission adds a credible, modest cost in identity. A deeper on‑page price or misstep under pressure would raise this.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s claustrophobia and promise-driven mission create credible, conflicting impulses, enacted through concrete choices (activating the chamber, taking the journal, refusing explanations). Bodily cues (“rebreather hissing,” corridors like a throat) ground emotion under pressure. Motivation is consistent and intensifies as the tide clock narrows options. Minor exposition around the discovery leans told rather than felt but doesn’t undercut her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific and embodied (heartbeat counting, chilled breath, porcelain shard as anchor), and his motive evolves credibly from correcting an “error” to accepting and using the ghost. The technique he learned “through weeks of failure” grounds competence with earned struggle. The internal contradiction (wanting restoration vs embracing evolution) becomes legible and resolves in a costly acceptance. A few lines verge on neat epiphany but are supported by on‑page process.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—preserve Thuvenli before dawn—embodied through tactile perception and tool‑use. Interiority is textured rather than labeled, but internal contradiction is light; she meets pressure with near‑flawless competence. The eventual cost (becoming a bone tower) lands more as epilogue than a dramatized choice. Still, micro‑choices with the diamond and bone towers reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motive (professional duty braided with a missing brother) is clear and drives choices, culminating in her decision to “join them.” Interiority appears in concrete touches (gravity pockets tugging her bones; breath clouding), though the insight arrives a bit abruptly (“She understood suddenly”). Thorne’s need—release grief for his daughter—aligns with the pressure but meets light resistance. The final renunciation of her cover feels earned if slightly swift for the emotional cost implied.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s motive—to reawaken beauty at real personal risk—is specific and embodied in micro‑choices (mapping rhythms, calibrating phrases, choosing to play despite alarms). The “gap between knowing and understanding” frames a credible hesitation before committed action. Interiority is vivid and character‑particular through her musician’s lens, though contradictions under peak pressure are more implied than dramatized. The cost awareness is present but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ezra’s respectfully rebellious ethos is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (keeping contraband, trusting “absences,” handing the bottle over) align with that motivation. Interiority is specific to his craft and history, though he reads a bit idealized with limited contradiction under pressure. The brief exchange with the Keeper adds relational charge without diluting his POV. A deeper on‑page cost or internal snag at the handoff would have heightened complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Emil’s interior is specific and embodied (damaged hearing, tactile craft), and his final act—singing after seven years—feels earned by the fragment’s pull and the angel’s invitation. The motivation “silence as possibility” is integrated into his choices rather than merely stated. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (avoidance of the last car vs. compulsion to enter), so the pressure never cuts deeply. Still, the renunciation of long‑kept silence carries visible cost in vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motivation and interiority are specific and credible—rituals, the scarf, his topology fixation—but internal conflict is soft, with little on‑page cost or contradictory impulse under pressure. His micro‑choices (guiding patrons without looking, tracing a curve) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The grandmother thread personalizes him without slipping into stereotype. The realization at the end feels earned by prior behaviors, though it’s more acceptance than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—Mara’s devotion to her grandmother’s scattered dream drives credible, felt micro-choices. The internal conflict peaks when she senses “something leaving her own chest,” embodying the price. Her renunciation reads earned by seven years of patterned behavior. A touch of abstract diction (“luminous absence”) grazes generality but doesn’t undercut specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s motive is legible and particular (grandmother’s charge; a locksmith’s ethic), with embodied cost (bleeding fingers) amid a credible, steady determination. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets disorientation with acceptance rather than struggle, which trims complexity. The “courage DNA” idea externalizes her resolve neatly but also drifts toward abstraction. Final endurance feels earned but not conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Margaret’s drive is clear and specific—recover Gran’s memories—and her folklorist habits inform concrete micro‑choices (cross‑referencing sketches, following the broken constellations, placing the mushroom). The reveal of darker memories introduces a credible internal tension and she chooses to shoulder them anyway. The cost (“her mind heavy with recovered histories”) lands on the page. A touch more contradictory impulse in the moment of reach would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s “combative tenderness” and backward‑walking tic give her specificity, and her insistence on teaching before touching the shard is a credible, value‑driven choice under pressure. Kess’s grief is active and contradictory—anger yielding to engagement—so the relationship serves as a crucible. The final exchange (“I’m teaching you to save yourself”) earns an internal shift with visible cost (Kess “aged years in an hour”). A slight safety in aphoristic wisdom trims the edge of messiness that could deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive and vocation are clear and particular, and her actions align with a decades-long purpose. Interiority comes through via tactile, profession-shaped choices (shears as needle, mist as thread). However, the piece offers little contradictory impulse or on-page struggle; her competence faces minimal friction. The resulting change reads as fulfillment more than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive (to restore masks and ground the dead) is clear and enacted through concrete craft choices under pressure. Interiority is specific (“lucid unrest,” scarred fingers), but internal contradiction is minimal and struggle feels almost frictionless. Her endurance across the night counts as cost, yet there’s little ambivalence or error to complicate the work. The closing acceptance of inheritance reads earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives are precise and character‑particular: a map framer whose real gift is reading erasures, choosing understanding over display. Her micro‑choices (synchronizing frames, using UV, filming herself) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—“not to map it but to understand”—is earned, though the on‑page cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s motive—answering an impossible transmission and translating loss—drives precise, professional actions (photographing, calculating, sealing artifacts). Her interiority is concrete and character‑particular (the ocean’s “electromagnetic whispers,” “first‑name basis with endings”). The key choice—to take the globe and journal, write a reply, and depart as the air pocket contracts—earns a credible cost. A hint more embodied contradiction under time pressure would push it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Chorus’s motive—bridging flesh and circuit—is clear and consistent, culminating in “knowing that she’d found her purpose.” The interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (singing as interface, feeling harmonics), but there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page cost. She adapts via invention and song, yet struggles are frictionless. The final renunciation/commitment lands but without a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s curiosity and care are concrete and embodied (frost, shuddering cables, the warmth revealing ink), and her motives drive each micro‑choice. The internal contradiction is mild—there’s little friction beyond cold and caution—so the arc leans discovery over struggle. Still, the final renunciation/embrace (“she would climb again,” encrypt her own joy) is earned by prior attentiveness. No therapy‑speak or stock reactions dilute the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motive—to prove a contested theory and honor a vanished predecessor—is clear and consistent, and her refusal of rescue implies real cost. Interiority is specific to her craft (taxonomy, sketches, instrument feel). Internal contradiction is mild; she mostly moves with serene conviction, so pressure reveals little new about her beyond steadfastness. Still, the final renunciation (choosing untethered drift into the storm) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyra’s tactile way of “seeing” yields specific, embodied choices (reading the coin, placing mirrors) that align with her motive to capture the library’s face. The prosopagnosia constraint is integrated rather than labeled, though the line “wasn’t a limitation but a different kind of sight” states a realization a touch too directly. Internal tension is present but quiet; she meets time pressure more than moral friction. Still, the final renunciation—walking away as demolition begins—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—diligent curiosity in chosen isolation—is clear and drives her micro‑choices (volunteering, adjusting course, relentless noting). Interiority is specific and embodied through her attention to objects (hopscotch board, phrasebook) and ship’s sounds. Internal contradiction is light; “sociable isolation” offers texture but little friction. The final stance—choosing purpose over recognition—feels earned though the felt cost remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive (to atone and “learn the rhythm of repair”) is specific, embodied through tactile craft and shame. The internal contradiction—force versus patience—plays out credibly via the gears and mirrors. Change is earned as she renounces forcing and accepts timing with a visible cost (waiting, humility). Pressure is mostly reflective, but still motivates micro‑choices that reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motive—selfless guardianship—reads cleanly and drives her dawn choices, with the bell and chalk as revealing actions. Interiority is mostly inferred through gesture and image rather than deeply dramatized contradiction. Secondary figures (Okafors, Nakamuras, Chen) function as clear pressures but stay surface-level. The final renunciation (fading) feels earned and paid for, though the inner cost is implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motive (buying humanity moments) is clear and personal, and his micro‑choices—touching the puppet, climbing, placing it in the lens, singing—reveal character under pressure. The inheritance moment (“I vouchsafe this burden…”) credibly reconfigures his role. Internal conflict is present but soft; he accepts the burden with little friction or visible cost beyond fatigue and voice crack. A touch more resistance or price on the page would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s duty-versus-freedom conflict is concrete and embodied: giving away the walnut binds her by choice while she longs to leave. Interiority is specific (“offhandedly exact,” clumsy but precise movements) and refracts through action. Micro-choices—lying to save, guiding with light, relinquishing the seed—align with motive and reveal hierarchy of values. The reluctance is felt without hedging into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied—her polymer lens colors perception, and the drafts/deletions show real ambivalence under pressure. The micro‑choices around texting feel earned and character‑particular. The decisive act (hitting send, releasing the chrysalis) credibly forecloses her control‑first path. The quick positive reply trims some felt cost but doesn’t erase her change.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Merrick’s motive and method are crisp and character‑specific, and the child’s desire “to forget how stories end” is strikingly clear. His warning about endings being woven through everything gives the choice weight. Interiority is present without therapy‑speak, though Merrick’s internal conflict is brief and he commits quickly. The felt cost to the child is implied rather than fully dramatized through her embodied reaction post‑procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Miran’s motives are clear and particular—she arrives to blunt her own rough memories and discovers a heavier communal burden—culminating in a costly, character‑driven choice. Interiority is embodied via gustatory memory and tactile contagion, not label‑speak. The on‑page fork (walk away vs. subsume) reveals values and risk tolerance. A slight safety in competence remains—the struggle is intense but never in doubt—but it’s still compelling at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marta’s motive and competence are crystal clear and embodied in purposeful, tactile choices (rigging the pendulum, modulating languages). Interiority is present but largely single‑valence—she faces little self‑contradiction or visible cost. The “empathetically decisive” trait manifests in action, yet the arc lacks a complicating flaw or hesitation under pressure. The ending shows change around her more than within her.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s motive—self‑alteration to decode embedded memories—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (the injections, the cataloguing). Embodied sensations (pressure through “someone else’s bones,” tremors) keep her interiority particular. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses, which lowers tension. The final renunciation/endurance (carrying others’ dreams at personal cost) reads credible but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—retrieve the “combinations” before gravity rights—yet interior contradiction is light; Orin’s prism-mind allows acceptance of paradox but we rarely feel fear or doubt in-scene. Micro-choices (kicking off the archway, pressing the node, returning to write) align with stakes. The ending’s Earned Stasis—choosing vigilance—lands with conceptual cost, though the struggle reads more competent than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive—to recover living sound from trees—drives every action and aligns with her tenderness-over-force ethic. Interiority is specific (reading stress cracks, sensing harmonies), and micro-choices (pressure, angle, which crack) reveal values under quiet pressure. However, contradictory impulses are minimal; she faces little internal resistance or risk beyond patience and fatigue. The endurance at the end (returning tomorrow, accepting the insulator’s wear) reads as earned but not costly enough for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Viktor’s motives and values are clear and consistently dramatized; the renunciation (staying) is earned through the accumulated teaching ethos and his bond with Mira. Interior contradiction is present but gentle—he weighs return vs. hard‑won truth—without much acute friction. The transfer of the worry stone reads as a concrete, costly choice that forecloses the Academy path. Mira adds relational pressure and reveals his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive (open the diary through tuned silence) and embodied, character‑specific perception drive her micro‑choices. The pacifist who “fights through frequency” is distinctive, though internal contradiction is soft (little friction beyond competence and urgency). The felt shift is credible: she reprices the lock’s purpose and chooses patience/tuning over force. A touch more visible cost or doubt under pressure would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s ambition versus the demanded stillness is embodied through tactile choices (dew collection, soil tending, sketch‑journaling) and her sensitive nose. The internal turn—accepting the stench as communication—feels earned. Slight softness: conflict remains gentle, with mockery offstage and few costly mistakes dramatized. Still, the final endurance under the bloom lands as a real renunciation of haste.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kessa’s goal is clear and her competence reads credibly; choosing the tighter spiral and anchoring through the Inversion align with her vocation. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the epiphany arrives with little on‑page struggle. Emotional texture leans explanatory rather than embodied at the peak beats. The final stance shift feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s competence, methodical perception, and mounting disorientation are specific and credible, and her micro‑choices (approach vs. install monitors vs. enter) align with her professional ethos. Motivation is clear (investigate to prevent) and intensifies at the singularity. Internal contradiction is present but muted—she feels the pull yet prioritizes systems over heroics. The arc culminates in a credible renunciation (monitor/report) with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyrian’s motivation—to preserve wonder and the bells—is clear and consistent, and her competence reads as earned. However, internal conflict is minimal; she never wavers or pays a felt personal price, which softens the peak choice. The strongest revealing beat is her realization the sheet is for aurora, showing adaptive intelligence. Emotional texture is present but rarely contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kessa’s motive—returning for understanding after failure—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (uncasing, marking the path, choosing the braiding song, accepting the seed) align under pressure. Interiority is concrete (“trembling,” the hush as presence) with a credible self‑reprice of her calling. Internal conflict (duty to seal vs. urge to braid) is present but lands smoothly; the scene lacks a moment where the cost bites physically or relationally. Strong, but the path from choice to success feels low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradictions are vivid: “lucid turbulence” lets multiple borrowed selves argue in-scene while she still executes craft choices. Motivation is clear and particular (to understand and render others via broadsheets), and actions align (presswork, type selection, use of the halo). The cost—eroding personal identity—lands credibly by dawn. Minor softness: her core want edges toward the conceptual, occasionally buffered by metaphor rather than concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s nervous competence, grief for Corvin, and fascination with relics create a coherent, character‑particular interiority. Her tremor reframes from flaw to asset, aligning motivation and action credibly. Internal contradiction (fear vs. calling) is present but gentle rather than pressureful. The final acceptance of responsibility feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation and embodied reactions (“trembling hands,” time‑pressure to photograph) ground Vera. Internal contradiction is light—she’s largely assured rather than torn—so the change reads more as confirmation than a costly pivot. Still, micro‑choices (angling the prism, deciding to document) align with her drive and reveal character under pressure. The final endurance—staking reputation on proof—lands credibly but with limited felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s motive—recovering her trafficked daughter—is urgent, concrete, and drives every choice on the page. Interiority is specific (the silence “tasting” memories) and embodied through what she surrenders. The tension between maternal resolve and the cost of losing her own memories creates credible internal conflict. The final Earned Stasis (smiling, nameless) is paid for by prior beats and lands as a believable price.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Korin’s meek, listening craftsperson is consistent and motivated; his choice to descend and reforge the silk aligns with his ethos. Interiority is present but low‑friction—he faces little internal contradiction or doubt. The merchant’s brief on‑page presence adds pressure only at the end. The final renunciation (“Cut only what binds…”) feels earned but carries limited visible personal cost for Korin.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s drive to find her mother and decode the shard is clear and consistent, and her competence reads particular through sensory‑translation craft. However, internal conflict is light; she pivots quickly from discovery to solution with limited visible hesitation or cost. The mother–daughter beat lands but lacks a fraught relational crucible beyond exposition and a quick accord. The final renunciation (shifting from exploration to repair) is credible but underfelt emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elsa’s motives are clear and rooted in character: a reticent, competent skipper drawn by coded trust and concern. Interiority is embodied (cold tower breath, sea glass warmth) and consistent with her quiet disposition. The acceptance of guardianship lands, though the internal conflict resolves a touch neatly, with minimal friction. The relationship with Jonas functions as a crucible but avoids melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s agency is clear and embodied through breath and laughter; her pause at the mirror‑ship and the harmonic decision register as a credible deepening. Internal contradiction is lighter—more awe than conflict—so the felt cost of the final shift is primarily conceptual. Still, her micro‑choices (calibrating laughter; choosing harmony) align with motives and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s drive (to manage the burden of a transplanted, story‑magnet heart) is specific and embodied through his dye‑maker perceptions and careful handling of the morpho wing. The donor reveal sharpens his internal conflict (gift vs. weight) and his “Teach me” plea is a credible, motivated micro‑turn. Emotional texture is clear without therapy‑speak, and the relationship with Chen applies gentle but real pressure. Cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally, which tempers the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s competence and long habit read clearly, and his choices (deconstructing, reassembling, installing) reveal character under pressure. The moonlight healing is embodied and particular. Internal contradiction is mild—he shifts from maintenance-as-preservation to maintenance-as-transformation—but never truly strains him. The arc lands, though it lacks a sharper clash of impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s drive is clear and embodied—last memory keeper trying to wake a realm—and her micro‑choices (starting with a whisper, scaling to communal song) align with that motive. The mention of prior desperate blood offerings adds credible shadow and cost. Internal contradiction is light; the piece favors determined endurance over thorny ambivalence. Still, the final acceptance of daily obligation reads earned and character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ezra’s paradox—an empath whose instinct to hide competes with the moral demand to help—is dramatized in his micro‑choices (rising despite the pain, sitting at a careful distance). His projected “enlarged tranquility” functions as both tactic and self‑harm with cost on the page. The woman’s presence focuses his flaw and value hierarchy without sentimentality. A few aphoristic lines lean declarative but remain earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s motive—attention as vocation—reads coherent and culminates in a believable reorientation from “cursed awareness” to “ministry.” Interiority is specific (moths writing messages; bread as compass) and choices follow her bias to notice and tend. Internal conflict is gentle rather than contested; the cost of the new calling is implied more than dramatized. The elderly woman exerts light relational pressure that clarifies, rather than tests, Lila’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s duty-bound triage under a live clock reads clear and particular, with tools and metrics revealing her mind. The internal tension between meticulous care and brutal selection surfaces (“she could save perhaps fifty slides”) but remains more implied than dramatized. The discovery of the founder’s vow credibly deepens her resolve without feeling like an unearned epiphany. A touch more contradiction embodied on the page (hesitation, a near-mistake) would have heightened complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mae’s motive (finish her father’s work by recording the breaking of trust) is clear, embodied, and drives micro‑choices like letting the woman take the fob. The lineage pressure produces credible status shifts and a lived moral tension between belonging and betrayal. Interiority is concrete (“wool blanket soaked in seawater”), not diagnostic. The cost—exile from the market—lands as an earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s drive (skeptical investigator seeking the truth of weather-carriers) is consistent and embodied through tactile choices with the ring. Her internal contradiction—implanted skepticism vs rising belief—registers in the dimming/brightening implants and the taste motif. Acceptance at the end reads earned but the visible cost of surrendering her identity is lightly sketched rather than dramatized. Secondary characters apply pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s grief and perfectionist reliance on memory create a credible internal contradiction that drives her choices. Her shift from sketchbook to crystal wall is an earned renunciation with felt cost. A few thesis‑forward lines (“Stop hiding behind memory. Create.”) compress nuance but the embodied beats carry the arc. The lock metaphor deepens her motivation without safety‑hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motives are clear and consistent—find truth, retrieve her grandmother’s letter, and deliver suppressed messages. Interiority is anchored in tactile specifics (brush, ink, tremors), but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers. Her final resolve feels earned yet largely unopposed by on‑page counterpressure. Still, micro‑choices (staying up to piece the map, entering the tunnel, deciding to deliver all) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mariel’s motive—preserving the “color of wonder” before the fragment melts—is clear and drives every action. Her competence reads particular (chains, gimbals, frequencies), and the physical choice to sacrifice the last ice carries felt cost. Internal conflict is minimal; her muteness is thematic more than pressure-bearing. Still, micro‑choices under time pressure keep her embodied and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    M-47’s motivation is clear and particular: resolve neural static without collapsing the dome. Interiority is embodied through sensor language and tactile ritual, creating a credible android longing that resists cliché. Contradictory impulses—mechanical precision versus “something strangely organic”—coexist on the page. The final renunciation (staying to tend) feels earned by the burn sequence and its risks.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta’s quiet, facilitative motive (“tilted her head—an invitation”) is consistent and drives choices; Elena’s re‑voicing is credible and moving. Interiority is light but targeted, embodied through object handling and micro‑choices. Relationship dynamics (Marta/Jorge/Mrs. Chen/Elena) are clean and mutually shaping. Cost is mostly emotional and communal rather than conflicting, which slightly softens the arc’s rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s motive and method are clear and embodied—she dances to decode, inheriting a role that fits her identity. Interiority is present but largely assured; there’s little contradictory impulse or cost as she proceeds. The destiny note lands, but without a frictional counterforce it feels less earned than accepted. Still, micro‑choices (beginning, intensifying, and reversing the dance) align with character and reveal resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina’s competing impulses—to reclaim her child and to protect herself from unbearable grief—are dramatized in the dig and the final renunciation-with-allowance. Her occupation colors perception (flames bending) and motivates attention. The kept single vial is a credible, costly compromise that forecloses a path. Interiority stays embodied and specific (coffee grounds, warm wildflowers) rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystal clear—contain a self-fulfilling prophecy—and actions consistently express skilled, ritualized competence. Interiority is textured but largely assured; the brief moment seeing “wars prevented, loves that would never bloom” gestures at conflict yet resolves without much embodied hesitation. Micro-choices (mapping pockets of quiet, catching fragments) reveal values but rarely tax them. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads credible though the cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s obsession with “deciphering the murmurs of old buildings” is specific and consistent, and her micro‑choices (keeping tea ready, handing Marcus the seal, agreeing to teach) align with that drive. The relationship dynamics are textured—his ritualized “borrowing sugar” and her guarded generosity carry subtext. The cost is subtle but legible: she moves from solitary collector to teacher, risking exposure of her private vocation. Internal contradiction could deepen (loneliness versus protectiveness) to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s motive—recovering quarantined memories to restore a coherent self—is clear and intensifies as the whispers cohere into coordinates and she digs. Interiority is specific and embodied (cut palm, dirt under nails) and the “skeptic/charmed” contradiction animates her persistence. The final choice to reintegrate feels earned by prior beats though the emotional price is softened by the immediate “teaching not trauma” reframing. A slightly tidier epiphany cadence trims some ambiguity but doesn’t break credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s motives are clear and layered: loyalty to family, commitment to a principled craft, and the desire to end a lineage of deception. Her contradictory impulses (save her brother vs. renounce forgery) act simultaneously and culminate in a costly renunciation. Embodied details (brushes as weapons, blood from the thorn) reveal character under pressure. The grandmother’s aphorism edges toward thesis, but the choice remains earned by on‑page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Senna’s motive—learn why some people echo and decide whether to join—drives clear micro-choices (listening, singing the taught melody, accepting the cost). Contradictory impulses (sorrow vs. calling) are present on the page as she weighs leaving her life to become “part of something vast.” Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (bone-ache recognition, tourist discomfort), avoiding therapy‑speak. A touch of thesis phrasing (“translators”) edges toward explicitness but remains earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motivation is clear and consistent—she dives for voices and truth—and her micro‑choices (placing the globe, reading the angles, transcribing) align with that aim. Interiority is specific (reading frost‑faces as “windows”) and embodied (gloves, warped plastic), but internal contradiction is light; competence comes a bit too smoothly. The chemist’s brief presence adds pressure but doesn’t force a fraught relational turn. The earned shift is a stance crystallization toward a larger mission, with only modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Her motive—attending to “hidden effort” through mending—is precise and embodied in choices (the tower, the whistle, the steady work). Interiority is sensorial and particular rather than generic. However, conflict is largely philosophical; she rarely meets resistance or contradiction beyond endurance, limiting palpable stakes. The endurance feels earned, but the cost remains mostly conceptual (anonymity) rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s investigative rigor, skepticism, and ethical quandary are clear and consistent, culminating in a choice that forecloses the splashy expose in favor of preserving the sanctuary. His internal conflict—debunking vs. protecting—plays on the page through concrete actions (digging up the diamond, seeding letters). Interiority is specific (methodical reconstruction, tactile handling of the stone) though occasionally told in thesis-like lines. The cost is credible and lived in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marlowe’s motive (“variant allegiance”) is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure—opening the portico in lightning, broadcasting primes and Fibonacci—align with that ethos. Embodied details (ear to cobalt glass, rain slashing) keep emotion concrete. Internal contradiction (serving the dawn, not the man) adds nuance, though the cost of her devotion is more implied than felt. A slightly stronger on‑page price at the end would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marcus’s motives are coherent and embodied—his jar‑collecting and the careful winding of the rusted key reveal a tender, obsessive ethos under pressure. The turn from solitary collector to translator feels earned through the encounter with Elena. Internal contradiction (solitude vs. connection) is present but lightly handled; the filmmaker solution reads a touch convenient. Elena’s brief on‑page presence is vivid and specific, sharpening his change.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivations are clear (protect the artifact/covenant), embodied, and escalate credibly as the Collectors approach. The trembling hands against precise sonic math displays a live contradiction that informs action. Micro-choices—tuning to the door, placing the key, matching the artifact—reveal character under pressure. The sacrifice is earned, though a shade more interior friction about relinquishing human life could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kira’s drive is precise and embodied: the “wildness” versus chosen patience creates a credible internal contradiction resolved through micro‑choices (slow breathing, methodical placement of rods). Motivation is concrete (seventeen winters, lunar charts) and actions align under pressure. The visible cost skews conceptual and endurance‑based rather than immediate peril, but it reads earned for this scope. Tomás supports rather than dilutes her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot’s interiority is specific and embodied (watchful calm giving way to trembling), and her resignation grows credibly from the sensory-memory experience. The lantern reframes her vocation as complicity, producing a believable break. A few thesis-like lines (“She’d been controlled too—by protocols…”) flatten nuance. Still, the final choice feels earned with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliza’s motive—to enact a repair as a way to metabolize grief—lands concretely in her hands and micro‑choices; Marcus’s long pursuit and decision to stay are consistent and purposeful. The sibling dynamic is refracted through action rather than exposition, especially when her movements echo Thomas’s. Internal contradiction appears in “He always broke things” versus her choosing to mend, but Marcus’s interiority is comparatively thin. The final stance (“maybe we deserve better...”) feels earned, though a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and particular—Pioneer’s “yearning algorithm” and steady curiosity drive concrete choices, culminating in the acid‑sea dive. Interiority is voiced through action (the kaleidoscope work) rather than labels, with Sprocket providing a light relational counterpressure. Internal contradiction is thin—she rarely doubts—so cost reads more as risk embraced than a struggle overcome. The transformation feels earned by prior behavior, but the emotional price is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motive and competence are clear, and her lie to the supervisor plus the breadcrumb choice show agency. The father–Apollo thread personalizes the quest without overexplaining. However, inner conflict is underplayed; she moves from discovery to self‑erasure with minimal on‑page hesitation or embodied cost. A touch more ambivalence or friction at the choice point would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motives are clear and consistent, and her final renunciation—carrying fragments as “seeds of transformation”—reads earned by prior beats. Interiority is specific (shadow‑weaving reframed as shields/bridges), though internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressure‑tested. The keeper provides a credible counter‑pressure without antagonism. The cost is conceptual (identity shift from enforcer to gardener) more than felt pain, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlene’s motivation—arriving to die and instead learning to endure by listening for endings—is vivid and internally consistent. Interiority is embodied through the parasol tip and the ice’s “music,” with credible contradictory impulses (courting closure vs. choosing vigilance). Micro-choices (volunteering for night watch, urging accelerated evacuation, staying on) feel earned. The only slight limitation is that her “loose grip on reality” functions more as gift than constraint on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motives are clear and continuous: he’s a keeper of memory and inter-world understanding, and the final mentorship gesture credibly extends that trait at a cost (a life of renunciation). Interiority is textured through tactile anchors (the burned fragment, bus taillights) rather than labels. The internal contradiction—accepting loss while still nurturing connection—registers without therapy-speak. Slight idealization in the “wisdom” framing trims complexity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation and role; her leadership and final unmasking register as an earned shift. Interiority is present but largely archetypal, with little contradiction or friction beyond duty vs. cost. The mask removal gives a tangible price and reconfiguration. Secondary characters apply minimal pressure, keeping the crucible narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific—she “reads” objects and converts grief into communal design—but she faces little resistance, so contradictory impulses never bite. Her micro‑choices (designing a treasure hunt, inviting descendants) track with her skill set and values. The calm/urgent split gestures toward tension, yet no scene‑level cost forces a trade‑off. The change at the end is credible but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s reticence and obsessive love for etymology drive credible choices, culminating in the decision to testify in a manner that risks status and clarity. Interiority is specific (“grief-tender,” “time-drunk”) and embodied (breath fogging glass, crystal warming in her palm). The contradiction—shy scholar choosing a bold, non-linear testimony—reads earned. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ezra’s motive—locating “the exact sound of time passing through a human body”—is clear, embodied, and governs his micro‑choices (chalk prophecies, driftwood maze, tuning static). The internal contradiction (curse vs. “kindness” of forgetting) reconfigures credibly at the end. The visiting woman adds pressure without stealing agency; their dialogue is purposeful and distinct. A touch more on Ezra’s fear of interfering in the moment of tuning would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ezra’s competence and motives are clear and particular—camera repairer turned guardian who chooses to tend rather than flee. Interiority is embodied (cables “singing,” teeth aching) and actions arise from her specific craft knowledge. The renunciation—choosing stewardship over escape—reads earned, though contradictory impulses could be shaded a touch more. Emotional struggle is present but a bit too smoothly solved by mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motives are lucid and embodied—“decisively kind hands,” her craft ethic, and the fractured/serene self-image in the vinyl groove all feel character-particular. Her agency drives every beat (commissioning the frame, building the album, leading the ritual, leaving). Internal contradiction is present but mild; she’s largely hyper-competent and steady, with limited on-page struggle beyond time pressure. A slightly deeper dramatized wobble under pressure would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lyra’s motive—discover where the noon shadows go and respond to her mentor’s charge—is clear and consistent, with competence grounded in her rune‑scholar habits. Interiority is present but largely functional; she rarely wavers, so contradictory impulses are faint. The acceptance of a guardian role carries conceptual cost but little on‑page emotional abrasion. Still, her micro‑choices (keying the automaton, tracing runes) align with pressure and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thomas’s motives—yearning for his sister and a healer’s ethos that favors transformation—are clear and embodied in micro‑choices (pocketing then returning the tooth; weaving the nest). Interiority is specific and character‑particular, with credible contradictions (skepticism evolving into forgiving awareness). The sibling dynamic carries subtle status shifts without melodrama. Slight neatness in aphoristic lines softens felt risk but not meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marina’s drive to restore guidance after the lighthouse failure is clear and consistent, with tactile motives (gem‑polishing skill, grandfather’s charge) shaping action. Interiority is concrete (charts by touch, lens‑polishing echo), but internal contradiction is minimal; she’s largely competent and unconflicted. The late exchange with Tomás adds social dimension and choice (to teach), though pressure on that choice is gentle. The final renunciation (sharing fragments) reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kira’s motives are clear and consistent—protect the sanctuary, transform harm into growth—and her key micro-choice (silencing reporters, then inviting Marcus in) feels earned. The embodied detail (handling the cutting; noticing drip‑rings) grounds emotion without label-speak. Internal contradiction is present but gentle: guarding privacy vs. offering the garden to another. A hair more friction or cost on inviting Marcus would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s conflicted drive to “solemnize an ending” versus her compulsion to collect hopes is clear and embodied through tactile choices (placing the fragment, speaking the vow). Her “lucidly watchful” perception is character‑particular and active, not label‑only. The renunciation—leaving the shell for the next pilgrim—forecloses a prior path with a felt cost. A couple of articulated insights verge on tidy (e.g., realizing she’d been “writing it backward”) but remain earned by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—restore the old rituals—is clear and consistent, and her choice to abandon tools for memory gives her agency. Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“weathered fingers… withered tendril”) but inner contradiction is minimal; she encounters little resistance once she hums. The shift from tinkerer to song‑keeper hints at renunciation but the cost is soft. The villagers’ arrival adds validation rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation and method are crystal clear, and her patience is embodied through slow, tactile action. Internal contradiction is minimal; she meets no counterforce beyond the ritual’s demands, so we learn little about fault lines or doubt. Still, micro‑choices under pressure (uncorking the vial, ignition, tracing) reveal a precise, disciplined temperament. The final endurance cost (spent starlight, physical stiffness) lands but remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—studying and documenting the temporal lock rather than fixing it—is clear and coherently tied to her locksmithing ethos. The internal contradiction (repair vs. document damage) subtly drives her micro‑choices and culminates in the choice to leave it unfixed. Emotions are embodied through craft‑specific perception (listening to silence, working peripherally) rather than labels. The cost is present but quiet, landing more as renunciation than a wrenching sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and particular—measuring grief by grams and angles is character-specific and embodied. The paradox of being boundary-lessly trapped vs. free is dramatized through her refusal to leave and the reliance on the grotto’s constraints. Micro-choices (reaching for the burner, orienting to vertices, adding the grotto’s weight) reveal values and cost. The ending’s endurance is earned, though true contradiction-in-action could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Margaret’s interiority is concrete and embodied—knife, grain, steam—and her choices (a handless clock, teaching workshops) align with a coherent, grief‑forged motive. Contradictory impulses (moving faster as the kettle rises, not rushed yet purposeful) reveal a live hierarchy of values. The endurance/renunciation at the end (“moving with” vs. “moving on”) is earned by prior particulars. A few thematic articulations tread close to stated thesis but remain grounded enough.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kira’s motives are clear and specific—once‑architect, now a scavenger of voices seeking an accounting with her ghost. Her contradictory impulses (rebuild vs. remember) are dramatized through concrete actions with the camera and the confrontation. The renunciation is credible and carries cost: she forecloses the architect’s path to accept stewardship. Emotion is embodied in tactile choices (winding, listening, touching) rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and character‑particular (engineering curiosity reframed as hope), and her micro‑choices (following blueprints, opening specific valves) align with that drive. Interiority is specific to her professional lens. However, internal conflict is minimal and the path feels relatively unresisted, softening the felt cost of her success. The ending stance shift (from seeker to navigator) is earned but not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: the sanctuary’s silence both soothes and imprisons, and the letter forces a choice between stasis and risk. Her ex‑pianist history is integrated with tactile detail (damaged fingers, quill work) that informs present tactics. The final compromise—teaching while remaining clock scribe—reads as earned stasis with visible cost. The emotional turn is slightly tidy but justified by the long accrual of silence and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is coherent and specific: a career of chasing legends reframed by an on‑page confession that mirrors her father’s deceptions. Interiority is textured through tactile habits (“fingers to read surfaces like braille”) and precise objects (the sundial) rather than labels. The culminating choice—to return home and confront her father—feels earned though the emotional struggle is largely reflective and gently staged. A slight tidiness to the epiphany keeps it just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—preserving vanishing knowledge—drives concrete micro-choices (decoding under cold, transcribing, deciding to teach and give away the fulgurite). Interiority is embodied through tactile rope work and weather. The cost is gentle but present (responsibility taken, relinquishing a cherished object). Limited internal contradiction keeps the arc quiet rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—writing obituaries for the living to map loss—is clear and sustained through concrete micro‑choices (pulling the thread, writing in air, planning the weavers’ visit). Interiority is specific and character‑particular, with embodied perception (thread’s warmth, dust settling on instruments). Internal contradiction is gentler than ideal; she rarely faces a conflicting impulse beyond quiet endurance. Still, the Earned Stasis at the end (choosing to keep mapping with cost) feels credible.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aldric’s motive (reviving lost beauty/life) is clear and embodied in tactile choices (building, calibrating, vigil). His contradictory impulses—exultation and grief at the flawed hatch—surface credibly and culminate in an earned endurance choice. The emotional cost is felt but modestly dramatized; he accepts isolation and imperfection rather than confronting a sharper trade‑off on the page. Strong interiority with minimal reliance on labels.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interiority is particular and embodied—her firefighter competence refracted through inherited fire—yielding credible contradictory impulses (kinship with flame vs. refusal to feed it). The on‑page ritual is a micro‑choice sequence that reveals values in action. The earned shift from grief to recognition feels motivated by prior beats. A slight tidiness in self‑articulation (“scars can sing”) trims the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motive (seventeen years of anomalies leading him here) is clear and his micro‑choices—producing the box, consenting to the woman, walking fountain to fountain—align with that drive. His internal shift from “luminous skeptic” to “realistically imaginative” lands, though the cost is mostly conceptual. The woman functions as a quiet crucible but remains enigmatic, offering limited relational pressure. Contradictory impulses are hinted, not dramatized under heat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Keeper’s motive—“to share light without using fire”—is clear and governs every micro‑choice (measuring the red giant, transiting, harvesting, resolving to continue). Her contradiction (burdened witness versus devoted tender) is embodied in small actions and returns in the final stance. The solitude cost is legible and accepted, an Earned Stasis. Slight softness: pressure rarely forces a hard trade‑off beyond reaffirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Martha’s motive—crafting a memorial that can hold braided grief—is clear and specific, and her agency (design choice, careful carving, public dedication) aligns with it. Interiority is embodied in tactile craft and the monarch cycle; “grief has grain” gives her a particular worldview. Internal contradiction is quieter—urgency vs. reverence—so the pressure doesn’t splinter her, but the cost of letting the grandfather’s voice fade lands. The final endurance/renunciation feels earned by the work done on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theodore’s guilt‑driven rigor is vivid, with concrete habits (1,847 turns) and a penitent ritual that reveals values under pressure. His micro‑choices—smuggling the rake handle, reading each inscription—align with an ethic that feels lived, not labeled. Internal contradiction (shame vs. duty/hope) is present but not deeply contested on the page; resistance is mostly internal and resolves cleanly. The endurance choice at the end reads earned, though the felt cost is quiet rather than scalding.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta’s interiority is specific and embodied—tools, threads, and root‑system metaphors reveal a temperament that makes her choices legible. Her small but meaningful renunciations (letting the clock run down, planning to return the fragment to earth) align with a gardener’s ethic of care. Internal friction—ritual vs. discovery, keeping vs. returning—exists but remains low‑temperature. The piece earns an endurance/renunciation shift rather than a dramatic turn, scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s motive—seeding innovation without burning systems—is clear and consistent, and her actions align (embedding visual algorithms). However, she encounters little direct resistance on the page; interior contradiction and embodied cost are minimal. The ethical ambiguity of manipulation and surrendering credit flicker but aren’t deeply dramatized. As a result, change reads as mastery exercised rather than struggle borne.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mariel’s motive—smuggling stories through music—is clear and consistently enacted, with tactile micro‑choices (dial adjustments, ink mixing) under pressure. Interiority is specific (“thistled calm”) and embodied, though internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers. Competence dominates, giving the piece poise but limiting visible struggle. The closing endurance choice reads earned, with implied risk rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marlene’s motives (to capture/curate a transitional emotion while secretly documenting fugitives) are specific and contradictory, surfacing through actions like using the mask as template and then erasing the portrait. Her interiority is spare but precise, avoiding stock language. The choice to walk through the portrait in the mask reads as an earned renunciation with cost. Minor tell-y lines compress complexity, but not enough to blunt the character’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s abrasive calm, isolation, and principled distrust drive every beat, culminating in a credible pivot to collaboration that costs him his solitary rebellion. Interiority is specific (water‑damaged texts, cross‑referencing) and revealed through objects and stance. The dynamic with the historian shows legible status shifts. A slight didactic tilt in dialogue (“Truth isn’t democratic”) keeps it from an even higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Chen’s motive—preserving a vanishing practice by teaching listening—drives clear choices (teaching the three modes, inviting others to find the rest, giving away the rosette). Her “expectantly resigned” stance plays against active generosity, earning the final renunciation. Embodied specificity (tracing mother-of-pearl, packing the zither) grounds emotion without gloss. Minor safety: her competence smooths struggle; internal contradiction could tighten under a sharper on‑page test.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives are clear and embodied through sensory choices (tasting, pruning, planting) that reveal a stubborn, nurturing defiance. Interiority is specific and rooted in craft; the “chef as gardener of memory” lens feels singular. However, internal contradiction is light—she rarely wavers or risks a genuine misstep—so pressure on her psyche is muted. The final stance is earned but pays a modest felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motives are clear and layered: protect the illicit bees, fear exposure, and a compulsion to honesty that both hobbles and frees her. Contradictory impulses act in scene (“Tower’s closed… Actually, it’s open…”) and culminate in the costly broadcast. Embodied details (the lacquer box’s warmth, racing heart) ground emotion. A few self‑labels (“I’m a thief and a liar”) edge toward tidy but are justified by the honesty curse.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motive—compulsively tracking “small wrongnesses”—reads specific and propels her to the bay and the final offering. Interiority is embodied (the shard’s “violet warmth”) and distinct without therapy-speak. The relinquishing of her grandmother’s shard is a credible cost that aligns with her earned understanding. Internal contradiction is mild; the piece privileges serene clarity over friction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Both Thessaly and Marina have clear, pressure‑tested motives that sharpen under revelation; Thessaly’s past atrocity and ongoing witness create credible contradiction. Marina’s internal shift—from certainty to nuance—reads earned with embodied detail (trembling hands, the ampoule). A slight on‑the‑nose streak (“History isn’t black and white—it's purple…”) trims subtlety but doesn’t undercut credibility. The final renunciation of absolute judgment feels paid for by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marcus’s motivation—math‑driven escape entwined with regret for Sarah—is coherent and specific, and his micro‑choices (seven‑step cadence, rolling, recalculating) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The grim optimism vs. grief tension feels lived-in rather than stated. The final endurance choice (Charged Poise) is earned, though the on‑page cost remains mostly conceptual rather than freshly dramatized at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motives (insomnia, drought, remembering the shopkeeper) are clear and embodied in tactile choices (taking up the brush, posting the work). The interiority is specific and sensorial rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is mild; tension rarely forces a trade-off beyond fatigue reframed as gift. The change reads as credible but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marta’s motive—rescuing fragile records under a live clock—is concrete and consistent, and her micro-choices (lens use, prioritizing initials, pressing the lens to stone) reveal values under pressure. Dread and tenderness coexist credibly, giving her interiority bite. The cost (she cannot save everything; parts visibly blur) is felt. Slightly limited internal contradiction beyond urgency keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her craft and her grandmother’s legacy drive the attempt—and her choices align with those traits. Interiority is specific (“forty years crafting timepieces that ran backward”) and embodied in action. However, there’s limited contradiction or real hesitation under pressure, which softens the felt cost of the final choice. The single whispered line hints at empathy toward the stone but doesn’t test her values meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: she’s nauseated yet compelled, death‑haunted yet increasingly agentic. Micro‑choices (showing the clasp, reading the notes backward, addressing Fear as a child) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The revelation “Fear was lonely” risks neatness but is causally earned by the mirror‑projection beat. Cornelius as peripheral guide pressures her without stealing agency at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kessa’s motive—to liberate the trapped orchard by turning constraint into instrument—is clear and embodied through tactile, sonic labor. Her interiority feels specific (mallet warmth, bone‑deep vibration), though contradiction is minimal; she rarely doubts or missteps. The cost is present but light (fatigue, aching muscles), limiting depth of internal conflict. Still, micro‑choices (reading clouds, adjusting rhythm) reveal a competent, focused psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motive—curiosity disciplined by pattern-thinking—drives every beat, with embodied dread (“sunlight felt heavy…”) counterpointing resolve. The internal conflict (fear vs. need to know) is credible and culminates in a costly choice to leave safety despite the warning. Her craft (spiral mapping, translation) expresses character through action rather than labels. Minor note: the emotional progression is smooth; a sharper stutter or irrationality under peak pressure could deepen the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and Marcus’s conflicted loyalty provides a credible crucible; his decision to lower the weapon and leave the insignia reads earned. Interiority leans expository at times (“emotional rationality”), but actions align with stated values. The relationship shift (student/agent to ally) lands, though Elara’s internal conflict is minimal, limiting complexity. The visible cost is mostly implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Edmund’s motives (official assessment vs. private memorialization) are clear and consistently embodied in small, tactile choices (opening the inkwell, documenting “interlaced absence,” sealing the bottle). His “stoically sensitive” nature is shown rather than told, with restraint guiding action and cost. Internal tension is quiet but legible—duty and time pressure against the need to honor his grandmother. The final renunciation of grand gestures in favor of hidden testimony reads as an earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (descending during blackout, shifting tactics, accepting “enough”) align with her goal. Interiority is sensory‑driven and character‑particular (listening to frequencies), avoiding cliché. Internal contradiction is minimal; she operates with steady focus rather than visible ambivalence, slightly flattening the emotional dynamic. The endurance choice at the end carries a modest cost (partial truth, time pressure) that reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mei’s motivation is clear and character‑specific—craft transmuting grief—and her actions (recording, then integrating gems into lanterns) align. Interiority is textured with embodied craft detail rather than labels. The internal conflict is more steady endurance than actively contradictory impulses, limiting peak complexity. The closing shift to acceptance feels earned through accumulated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Amira’s motive (grief-driven reclamation) is clear and consistently enacted through concrete tactics under pressure. Her agency steers every turn—planning the breach, adjusting frequencies, enlisting Chen, prioritizing “return” over “harness.” Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers, which trims psychological complexity. Still, embodied stakes (the geode’s weight/warmth; the security risk) keep her from reading schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s motives (curiosity → decoding the site’s message) are clear and her choices drive discovery; embodied reactions (the gasp, the tactile pull) land. Internal contradiction is light—she shifts from skepticism to acceptance smoothly, with little friction. The pilgrim adds gentle pressure but never truly tests Kira. The closing reorientation feels earned but not costly in character terms.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s vocation and moral rot are crisply drawn, and his recognition of complicity grows credibly from tactile discoveries (the dates, coordinates). The decision to shut down his business is motivated and bears cost. Internal contradiction (profit from erasure vs. late hunger for truth) is present but resolves a touch tidily, with limited on‑page friction. A sharper moment of resistance or self‑serving rationalization under pressure could have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s conflicting impulses—grief/vengeance versus principled restraint—are vividly embodied in her ritual with the drawer pull and her “down payment” acceptance of apology. Thorne’s status drop and rusted apology carry lived cost. Micro‑choices (having him hold the pull; deferring forgiveness) reveal a credible hierarchy of values under pressure. Both voices remain distinct and morally complicated without safety‑hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and particular—sobriety, tactile relationship to the broken compass, and pole‑by‑pole micro‑choices show a man negotiating guilt and caution. The stop at pole nineteen and his decision to teach are earned by prior beats. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. instinct, isolation vs. service) run concurrently. Slight sentimentality in the final exchange softens the edge of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s “guilt without memory” is a precise, character‑particular contradiction that drives his choices, culminating in the earned decision to step onto the first bridge. Interiority stays embodied (tender extraction ports, tracing the baseball), avoiding therapy‑speak. The old woman supplies pressure without stealing agency. The renunciation of apology in favor of acts of understanding reads as a credible, costly stance shift for him.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motive to reach Kess is clear and urgent, and her “paradoxically steady in my uncertainty” captures lived contradiction that carries into action. The embodied metamorphosis ("petals becoming scales...") grounds emotion in sensory change. Micro‑choices (coming to the orchard, uncorking the vial) align with an acceptance of cost. Silverwhisper adds light relational pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to unfasten the binding between her daughter’s birth and her mother’s death—is clear, character‑specific, and embodied in tactile choices (palm over the crack, choosing the restoration spread). Contradictory impulses (devotion to occult craft vs. guilt for not holding her mother’s hand) coexist in scene. The “willingly perplexed” trait refracts as a flaw and a strength, giving her a believable, earned shift without easy absolution. Cost is acknowledged (“Not her guilt—that would remain forever”), lending credibility to the change.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s purpose and pacifist training ground her tactics, and her equilibrium practice (too much grief vs too much happiness) gives her interiority a concrete, character‑particular texture. Contradictory impulses are active on the page—her soul recoils at the screams even as she chooses to stitch. The shift from “last human born” to “first human complete” feels earned by the prior choices, though a few lines tilt abstract. The visible cost is primarily emotional endurance rather than a setback, but it reads credible for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive—to understand transformation—grounds her choices, and the lifetime of giving provides credible motive for the final surrender. Interiority is sensorial and particular (black sand, bottle heat), with micro-choices like arranging and opening the bottles. The piece skews toward serene acceptance over contradiction, so internal conflict remains muted. Still, the culmination reads earned with a clear felt cost: self-dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thorne’s motive and competence are clear, and his tactile engagement with objects (quill holder, sundial) reveals character under pressure. The Amara exchange adds status nuance and complicity. Internal conflict is thin—he rarely wavers or pays an immediate personal price—so the arc reads more steady resolve than contradictory impulse. Still, micro‑choices (the final degree adjustment, the quiet acknowledgment of risk) are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yann’s motive (to decode her grandmother’s promise and understand the eels) is clear, and the curse of foresight gives her a credible inner friction. The decisive change—reframing her “curse” as time’s transparency and accepting stewardship—feels earned. However, contradictory impulses in-the-moment are lightly rendered; she rarely resists or adapts under pressure, largely following preordained motions. The emotional cost is present but mostly conceptual, not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s motives are crystalline—turn censorship’s wounds into a new grammar—and her “furiously tranquil” poise under the storm embodies contradiction without neatness. Micro‑choices (penlight exposures, timing, hiding the envelope) reveal a hierarchy of values: risk art over safety. The exile and secrecy register as a credible, ongoing cost rather than a one‑off pose.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlowe’s motive—using a “duel” as covert negotiation toward resistance—is clear and consistent, with tactile traits (mechanical arm) grounding her intellect. Interiority is specific (questions as destinations; “intellectual jazz”) and her status dance with Reeves is legible. Contradictory impulses (iconoclasm vs. disciplined structure) are dramatized but the on‑page cost at closure is light. The endurance/renunciation component is implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    October’s motives and methods cohere—multiplying identities to rebuild “a book of broken books” and seed resistance—conveyed through concrete choices (salvaging, sequencing pages, planning November). Interiority feels particular (“illegible by choice”), with tactile engagement (Neruda, Rumi, Dickinson fragments). Internal contradiction is present but light: she refuses legibility yet seeks communal impact. The cost is implied (risk to the network), not fully dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marion’s motive (refusing to accept Sophia’s loss) is clear and her tactics—learning the reels, tuning music to frames, improvising—embody “strategically creative.” Interiority is specific and embodied in action rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (hope vs. the terminal’s emptiness), keeping it short of the most complex psychological layering. The closing stance shift is earned as endurance with cost reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motive and vocation are crisply drawn, and her choice to ratify paradox over consensus tracks with her lived pressure and discoveries. Interiority is sensorial and particular (seed “heavier than grief,” memories like corridors). The internal contradiction—empirical mandate versus prismatic truth—acts on the page. The cost is present but largely conceptual (Council challenge), not deeply felt in-body.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kenji’s interiority is specific and embodied—his grief and restraint refract through bonsai practice, the lace, and the student. Contradictory impulses (teaching calm vs. longing for Yuki) operate simultaneously and culminate in a costly micro‑choice (giving away the compass, deciding to write). The student applies soft pressure that sharpens Kenji’s values without stealing focus. Nothing reads like stock psychology; the emotional texture feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between data reduction and patient observation is compelling. Her decisive change—resigning—is earned and carries a visible cost. The only minor weakness is that her colleagues are slightly one-dimensional foils, serving primarily to embody the "theatrical" opposition without much nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a specific, embodied interiority. The transition from a grieving, hunted artist to someone with a dangerous new purpose is earned through reflection that directly alters her choices. The final, costly decision to embrace a new identity and mission feels both surprising and inevitable, satisfying the 9+ test for an earned change that forecloses her past life.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation to “rectify what the silence had stolen” is clear, specific, and poignantly rooted in her trauma. Her interiority is beautifully embodied through her perception of vibration and heat, avoiding stock emotional language. The final image of tears freezing on her cheeks is a powerful, earned expression of grief and wonder, demonstrating a complex internal state without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, linking his profession and personal curse to the story's cosmic resolution. The transformation of his calling is earned. However, his interiority occasionally relies on high-concept labels like "architecture of rest" rather than more deeply embodied struggle, making him feel slightly more like a perfect vessel for the theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marta's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization leans toward an archetype of gentle wisdom rather than a person with palpable internal contradictions. Her philosophy is presented fully formed, and while her actions are compelling, the internal struggle is absent. The dialogue with Samuel ("need has no face...") functions more as a thematic thesis statement than a discovery, slightly flattening the character's dimensionality in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mae’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a past-life memory that provides a unique internal pressure. Her character is revealed through her focused actions with the camera obscura, culminating in a meaningful change from seeker to giver. The final choice to release her captured images feels earned, demonstrating a shift in her core understanding, though the interiority sometimes relies on slightly familiar phrasing like "longing...burning in her chest."

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to understand time's texture is clear and compelling, driving her actions within the scene. The interiority is rich and specific, successfully embodying abstract concepts like "retrocognitive imprisonment" through physical sensations. The final change feels earned, though the epiphany in the second-to-last paragraph ("The texture of time wasn't something to be discovered but something to be created") verges on being too diagnostically articulated instead of purely shown through the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear and his defining trait—patience—is effectively dramatized through his long-term preparation. The transition from captive to liberator is earned. However, his interiority, while functional, lacks significant contradiction or complexity; lines like "His liberation meant nothing if he couldn't complete the mission" state his resolve directly rather than embodying it through a more textured internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb. Elena’s motivation is specific, deeply personal, and consistent, driving her every micro-choice. Her interiority is rendered with unique, concrete details like her synesthesia and obsession with cellular betrayal, avoiding stock emotions. The final change is earned through the on-page process, a genuine evolution of understanding rather than a sudden epiphany. A hairline deduction for the slightly over-articulated reflection on cellular division, which reads more like a thematic thesis than an in-the-moment thought.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cassia's motivation as an "archaeology of light" is clear and compelling. Her competence is well-established, creating a strong character foundation. However, some interiority feels more like authorial summary than embodied thought, particularly the lines that directly explain her ethos ("This was why Cassia did what she did...") which slightly flatten her internal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina's motivation is clear and her actions are a powerful embodiment of her internal state. The central contradiction—her movements being "both heavy with memory and light with possibility"—is beautifully sustained. Her ritualistic self-narration is a strong character choice, though a few lines verge on being too self-aware, slightly flattening the subtext of her internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his arc is compelling, particularly the re-contextualizing of fear into precision. The core contradiction of a phobia-ridden stunt double is well-conceived and pays off. The shift from terror to "trembling certainty" is a strong beat, but the line "The betrayal should have shattered Marcus, but instead..." is a minor instance of telling an emotional summary rather than letting the subsequent actions fully embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The oracle's motivation ("mildly obsessed") is established immediately and embodied through her actions—watching the star and clutching the booklet. Her interiority is rendered with unique, concrete concepts like the "ambered hush," avoiding stock phrasing. The final earned shift from a desire for completion to an acceptance of process shows a credible, profound change rooted in her established traits and the story's core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seven's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a single, driving question. His character is revealed through his precise, mechanical actions, which contrast effectively with his burgeoning internal world. The trait of being "remarkably composed" serves as a believable anchor for his experience, but the final epiphany lacks a strong sense of internal contradiction or struggle, reading more as a placid acceptance of new data than a transformative character moment with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira's and Samuel's motivations are clear, intertwined, and create a compelling internal contradiction: the desire to protect someone they care about versus the need for honesty. The internal conflict is dramatized through action (eavesdropping, altering records, showing up to the meeting) rather than just summarized. The final choice to trust again is earned through the preceding mutual confessions, showing a believable and costly emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marta’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear, consistent motivation that is both grand (resisting determinism) and granular (caring for a single plant). Her internal conflict is beautifully externalized in the cracked marbles and her "blooming and withering" smile. The final, generous act of giving away a marble is a perfect, earned culmination of her established traits, showing her philosophy is not just for her own garden but a legacy to be shared.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ira’s motivation is singular and powerfully dramatized; her choice to ignore Vasquez’s call in favor of her experiment is a perfect micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values. The internal conflict between her station duties and personal passion is present but could have been embodied with a slightly sharper contradictory impulse in the peak moment. Her transition from "obliging sky mechanic" to "navigator of time's hidden dimensions" is earned and provides a strong, satisfying arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his artistic sensibility and the supernatural discovery. His actions align perfectly with his goal of honoring the "conversation with the past." While the external world dismisses him, the story focuses so effectively on his internal drive that the lack of a deep, contradictory internal conflict feels like a valid choice for this atmospheric piece. The final transformation is more symbolic than psychological, which fits the genre but keeps the characterization just shy of perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira's characterization is exceptional, defined by a specific, high-concept trait—being a "fault-tolerant oracle"—that is masterfully grounded in her choices. The internal conflict between official duty and intuitive truth is embodied, not just stated. Her final action, to smudge the signature, is a perfect culmination of her character, an earned choice that demonstrates her values with a clear, felt cost: the solitary weight of the knowledge she protects.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and evolves organically from curiosity to a sense of solemn responsibility. His interiority is conveyed through sharp, specific details, such as his "drowsy alertness" and his Methodist-trained skepticism, which provides a compelling internal conflict against the supernatural hints. The final choice to witness rather than possess is a powerful renunciation, fully earned by the preceding accumulation of confessions and a testament to a well-realized character arc in a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization is more a profound philosophical state than a dramatization of internal conflict. While her renunciation in the face of the explorers is a powerful micro-choice, the story lacks moments where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in a scene. Her interiority is beautifully rendered but remains at a uniform, slightly abstracted elevation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong and consistent. Elena's motivation is rooted in her profession and her history as a mother, making her actions feel authentic and earned. Her interiority is specific and lyrical ("underground symphony only mothers could hear"). The change at the end—seeing the magic passed on rather than just preserved—is a credible and satisfying culmination of her character arc, earned by the story's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thrain’s characterization is realized through her unique, embodied mode of perception, which is both a tool and a source of her isolation. Her motivation is clear and deepens from a general custodial duty to a profound, specific purpose. The final acceptance of her role is an earned, quiet crystallization of her identity, serving the story's conceptual closure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.6)
    Chen’s characterization is superb, established through his actions and a specific, resonant interiority. His motivation—to shift from orchestrating others' lives to composing his own—is earned through the story's accumulative detail, culminating in the powerful line, "The composer becomes his own music." The final choice is a perfect, inevitable expression of his established traits, and the cost (his disappearance) feels both significant and transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Father Marcus is sharply defined by his unique philosophy and methods, with strong, specific interiority. However, his supreme confidence and competence leave little room for internal conflict or doubt, making him feel at times more like a conduit for the story's concept than a character struggling under pressure. The lack of a visible blind spot or moment of uncertainty keeps the characterization just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority fused perfectly to the story's central concept. Mei's internal conflict is not just stated but embodied in her "chronological homesickness" and the looming exhaustion. The final act of conducting is an earned culmination of a lifelong perceptual state, making the resolution feel both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kira's motivation to integrate her fractured self is clear and compelling, driven by the pain of her condition. The internal conflict is well-externalized through the other Kiras and the shifting viaduct. The final choice feels earned, but the older Kira’s line, "Every choice murders infinite possibilities," while poignant, borders on being a thematic summary, slightly flattening the earned epiphany with a pre-packaged maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lucia’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal journey is rendered through specific, embodied sensations. The character's change is earned through the central on-page experience. The score is capped from the 9+ band because the final realization ("She understood now that her deafness wasn't an ending but a transformation...") reads more like a tidy, diagnostic summary than a raw, in-the-moment epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a meticulous nature that informs every action, from handling instruments to deciphering the message. The shift from solitary integrity to active resistance is earned and compelling. The final choice to reply is a perfect culmination of her established character, showing a renunciation of safe solitude with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, moving from grief-driven curiosity to a profound acceptance of her legacy. Her internal conflict between caution and the need to understand is embodied in her trembling hand and her decision to uncork the vial. The transformation is earned through the preceding sensory and emotional beats, making her final state a credible, costly evolution rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s motivation as a poet seeking "complete understanding" is clear and consistently drives his choices. His interiority is strong, especially the shift from composer of verses to a being who can perceive time's texture. The character's transformation is earned through the escalating revelations, culminating in an authentic, wondering laugh rather than a simple solution.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her inherited gift and her grandmother's wisdom. Her interiority is well-drawn through her perception of sound, and her central choice to play is well-earned. While her internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory, her final acceptance of "perfect incompletion" represents a meaningful change earned by the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her core internal conflict—professionalism versus the desire to feel—is effectively dramatized. The renunciation of her desire to "subsume" the emotions provides a strong moment of character choice with a felt cost. The score is slightly tempered because the final paragraph's articulation of her philosophy feels more like a tidy summary than an in-the-moment thought process, softening the raw edge of her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margot’s initial motivation for her pivotal choice feels slightly thin, relying on a generalized reflection rather than a sharp, personal contradiction. Her transformation from a solitary accountant to a community linchpin is significant, but the final interiority summarizes her change with a neatness that borders on diagnostic self-awareness ("understanding finally that some accounts balanced themselves..."). However, her core trait—a broker's instinct for seeing value and facilitating exchange—is cleverly reapplied to an emotional economy, making her arc feel consistent even if its articulation is too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira's motivation is clear and consistent, but she functions more as a benevolent catalyst than a character with deep internal contradictions. Her defining trait, "boldly sympathetic certainty," is asserted but not meaningfully tested. The other characters are archetypal—the wise elder, the lost artist—serving their thematic roles effectively but lacking complex interiority. The emotional progression is earned, but the characters read as instruments of the fable's theme rather than deeply flawed individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina's motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in her role as a temporal naturalist. The shift in her goal—from merely perceiving interruptions to actively ending them—is earned by the central discovery. While her internal state is conveyed effectively through action, a deeper layer of contradictory emotion or internal conflict during the pivotal choice could have elevated the characterization from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Morrow's motivation is clear and her methodical nature is demonstrated, not just stated. The character arc from puzzlement to a new understanding is earned. However, her final internal monologue drifts into abstract, diagnostic language ("Loss was only ambiguous because humans insisted on binary definitions"), slightly flattening the specificity of her voice in the story's most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Edgar’s motivation is deeply rooted in his backstory and consistently expressed through his "kindly, methodical" actions. The internal conflict between his profound isolation and his hunger for connection is embodied, not just stated. The final choice—to trust the archivist and reveal the rest of his collection—is an earned and moving evolution, representing a re-framing of his existence rather than a simple change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—to understand through scientific control—is clear and creates a potent internal conflict against his dawning realization that participation is required. The micro-choice to loosen his grip on the leaf is a perfect, embodied pivot point. The final change is earned through his sustained observation and the weight of his grandmother's remembered wisdom, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a clear, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and embodied. Her exhaustion isn't just stated; it makes her tongue "heavy" and requires immense focus to navigate the trails. The internal conflict between survival and the need to create meaningful art is dramatized powerfully in the exchange of the brooch. The final choice to paint the other woman's daughter shows an earned change, moving from personal artistic need to a sacred commemorative act, demonstrating a perfect alignment of motive, action, and theme with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the single scene effectively. Her interiority is well-rendered, though the final transformation ("Vera felt herself expanding") relies on a somewhat familiar mystical trope. The change is earned by the events on the page, but the lack of a truly contradictory impulse in the moment of crisis keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kessa's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her unique profession. Her interiority is specific and poetic, avoiding cliché. The character serves the story's conceptual core flawlessly, and her final action provides a powerful, earned sense of closure. The only minor weakness is that her internal conflict is more of a philosophical puzzle than a deeply felt struggle, making her slightly more of a thematic vessel than a fully complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation as an obsessed cartographer is clear and compelling. The arc from "trembling certainty" to "steady purpose" is earned and satisfyingly resolved. The characterization is slightly held back by the somewhat cliché internal conflict of "analytical mind" versus "artistic soul," which is stated more than it is embodied in contradictory micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s core contradiction between empiricism and inherited intuition is dramatized with precision. Her wavering voice when calling the whales' arrival a "coincidence" perfectly embodies the simultaneous impulses acting in the scene. The final change feels earned, stemming directly from her choice to engage with the mystery rather than dismiss it.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vex’s motivation, rooted in twelve millennia of ennui, is both clear and deeply felt, making her final choice to embrace the unknown entirely credible. The shift from weariness to a hopeful smile is an earned and powerful character moment. The internal conflict is concisely established and resolved through a decisive action, showing a clear hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Maya's internal conflict—inheriting her father's dexterity but not his morals—is established with potent economy and drives every action. Her calm professionalism while performing the embalming provides a powerful, embodied contrast to the immense emotional and ethical weight of the confrontation. Wei's transition from rage to understanding is earned and believable because it's forced by Maya's unassailable honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stationer's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are perfectly aligned with her profession. Her interiority is concrete, focusing on the sensory details of her craft. The character reads as a compelling archetype of the archivist-as-mystic, but lacks a sharp, contradictory internal conflict; her purpose is single-minded, which slightly flattens the potential for deeper struggle beyond the physical exertion described.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mari’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific detail, such as her mother's last words feeling like "fabric unraveling." The final choice to sign the journal is a perfectly earned culmination of her character arc, renouncing her old life with a palpable cost. The characterization is nearly flawless, with the only slight limitation being that the internal conflict reads more as a steady, lyrical progression than a clash of simultaneous contradictory impulses in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina's transformation from "myth buster" to "myth preserver" is earned and compelling, grounded in her humming habit that bookends the story with new meaning. Her final choice to stay has a clear, felt cost—the abandonment of her professional skepticism for a more vulnerable, participatory role. Claudia is a slightly too-convenient narrative device, as the text itself cheekily admits, but she serves her purpose efficiently without undermining the core emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her core internal conflict of "dual allegiance" is more stated than dramatized. The "impossible choice" is resolved with a brilliant plan that feels frictionless, making her competence overwhelm any sense of genuine struggle or personal cost. Her character serves the plot effectively but lacks the specific, embodied contradictions that would elevate her beyond a highly capable archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.6)
    Vera's motivation, rooted in her "purposefully curious" nature, is exceptionally clear and consistent. The character is rendered through specific, resonant actions rather than exposition, and her interiority feels authentic to her isolated, scientific perspective. The final, symbolic choice to leave the hourglass is a perfectly earned renunciation that encapsulates her entire arc with profound, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s characterization is strong and her motivation is seamlessly integrated with her unique abilities. The story successfully shows her competence under pressure. However, her dialogue occasionally slips into articulating the story's theme directly, as in "Beauty isn't just visual... it's the harmony between broken things learning to work again," which feels more like an authorial summary than an organic character utterance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot's motivation is clear, consistent, and specific: a professional obsession that has become personal. Her interiority is revealed through action and sharp observation, avoiding summary. The "dry wit" is demonstrated, not just labeled, providing a convincing shield for her intense focus. The final choice to trust the inspector is earned, flowing directly from the established traits of intelligence, obsession, and a calculated boldness, with the cost of professional and personal risk made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bell tuner is a compelling archetype but not a deep character; her motivation is stated rather than revealed through internal conflict or costly choice. She functions as an unchanging catalyst, which is appropriate for a fable but lacks the contradictory impulses expected in top-tier literary fiction. The townspeople's collective shift from skepticism to belief is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maya’s motivation is complex and her final choice is earned through a sophisticated internal turn, linking her daughter's memory to the act of preservation. The internal conflict between scientific duty and the temple's call is clear and compelling. The transition from documentation to sacrifice in the final act feels slightly rapid, and a line like "terrified and thrilled her in equal measure" is a minor cliché that holds it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus's motivation is exceptionally clear and born directly from the premise. The shift from cursed inheritor to "Marcus True-Tongue" provides a satisfying arc, but his interiority lacks significant contradiction; he proceeds on a straight path once the journal is found. For the highest tier, a moment of doubt, fear, or a conflicting impulse acting in-scene would elevate the characterization from strong to truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by the contradictory impulse of "mournful elation." Marlow's complex love for a "beloved yet poisonous" entity feels authentic. The ghost's motivation is given a powerful, earned twist at the climax, reframing her entire existence from one of debt to one of longing for release, which lands with significant emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Calla's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her past as a poet and her present as a myth-maker. Her interiority is specific and poetic, aligning perfectly with the story's lyrical tone. The central choice—to transform ruin rather than restore a lost past—is earned and provides a strong character arc within the short frame. A slight deduction is for moments where her state is articulated with a bit too much self-awareness, as in "Her optimism was haunting precisely because it grew from such barren ground."

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.3)
    Miriam’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from skeptical returnee to committed participant is earned. The contradictory impulses—being drawn to the place while intellectually questioning her return—are well-established. Her final choice to stay is a powerful culmination of the scene's accumulative pressure, with the cost of her former life felt rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mira’s motivation is expertly established and consistent, rooted in a professional philosophy that feels both unique and deeply human. Her interiority is concrete and particular, shown through her meticulous process rather than abstract labels. The final moment of quiet satisfaction is an earned stasis, a believable continuation of the character established throughout the scene, with the cost of her ephemeral work being a price she willingly pays.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.6)
    Vera's characterization is exceptional, built on the potent contradiction between her outward performance of foolishness and her sharp interior reality. Her motivation is clear and her actions, from the feigned drool to the deliberate finger prick, are purposeful micro-choices that directly serve her goals. The genius of her disguise is dramatized through her interactions with Hecht and Crane, making their condescension a tool she expertly wields.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her final change is well-earned. However, a few moments of interiority read as overly diagnostic or thematically articulate, such as "healing required exposure," which slightly undermines the otherwise strong embodied emotion. The core internal conflict between self-protection and connection is powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maya’s interiority is well-rendered, and her shift from a professional dealing with grand conflicts to a personal healer is earned. The motivation is clear and consistent. The phrase "lotus-hearted ache" is memorable but skirts the edge of being overly poetic rather than a purely embodied emotion, slightly abstracting the feeling it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong. Marina's motivation to connect with a lost past is clear and her internal shift from weary preservationist to joyful creator is earned. The moment she laughs, "surprising herself with the sound," is an excellent piece of embodied emotion that shows, rather than tells, the fog's oppressive effect and the power of the vision. Her final resolve feels like a natural and compelling evolution of her initial state.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, hinging on the well-dramatized internal conflict between Elena’s "methodical nature" and her emergent "inexplicable playfulness." This contradiction is not merely stated but resolved through her final, costly choice. The pivot from a professional restorer seeking answers to a playful participant in a mystery is earned and gives the ending its power.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, culminating in a well-earned final choice. His expertise as an entomologist is skillfully integrated into his actions under pressure. Serena serves her role as a catalyst effectively, though her character leans slightly into the "charming rogue" archetype without as much on-page contradiction as Marcus shows in his calm defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet's motivation is archetypal yet clear and potent, serving the fable-like tone. Her interiority is expressed lyrically through her relationship with the shell and the postcard. However, the character lacks sharp internal contradictions acting in-scene; her core struggle is resolved before the story begins, making her more of a vessel for the theme than a character wrestling with a difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, and her final shift in perspective is earned. However, her competence is so complete ("practiced grace," "gently systematic precision") that there is no moment of on-page struggle or internal conflict. A moment of doubt or a single fumbled motion during the delicate preservation process would have added a layer of texture and heightened the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, directly tied to the global stakes. However, her characterization leans heavily on her competence, with the central "carefully reckless" trait being more stated than dramatized through conflicting on-page choices. The internal struggle is present but lacks the contradictory impulses or visible trade-offs that would elevate it to exceptional; she solves the puzzle with brilliance but without a palpable personal cost or a significant misstep born from her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is exceptionally clear, complex, and dramatized. The internal conflict between the "elegant cruelty and kindness" of her solution is embodied in her trembling, a superb micro-choice. The influence of her grandmother's philosophy provides a strong, earned foundation for her "slyly heartfelt" approach, making her final renunciation of credit feel both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot's motivation and internal conflict are rendered with convincing specificity. Her transformation from a "brittle" and suspicious woman to an integrated archivist is earned through her tangible actions with the letters. The internal contradiction is consistently shown, culminating in a final choice of acceptance that feels both surprising and inevitable, carrying the felt cost of her painful journey.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, culminating in an earned final choice. The interiority is specific, though it occasionally relies on direct statement ("Marina intuited") rather than fully embodied discovery. The character's unique perceptual lens, inherited from her father, is a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique profession. Her interiority is well-drawn, particularly her contrast with Chen's instrument-focused approach. The final shift to "inhabiting" the mystery is earned, though the epiphany is slightly over-articulated in the final paragraphs rather than purely embodied in the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction of "cheerful gloom" is beautifully sustained and embodied, not just stated. Her motivation is clear and her final shift in perspective is earned through on-page observation, representing a credible evolution. The character's voice and worldview are singular and consistently filtered through her unique occupation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Marcus's analytical nature is not just stated but demonstrated through his every observation and action, from "calculating sight lines" to modifying a shanty with "diminished sevenths." The core tension between his calculated method and his desire for genuine connection is masterfully shown, culminating in the empathetic, high-stakes choice to play his personal composition for the teenager.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her final choice is earned. The interiority is poetic and particular to her artistic discipline. The characterization lacks a moment of sharp, embodied internal contradiction during the ritual itself; she reads as fully resolute, which slightly lessens the tension of her final, sacrificial act.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation is crystalline, rooted in his profession and ignited by a specific, credible catalyst. His interiority is rendered with beautiful specificity, linking his technical knowledge of glass to his dawning philosophical insight. The final shift from passive observer to active teacher is earned by the scene’s events, and the emotional progression from quiet awe to determined purpose feels authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Marcus’s interiority is concrete and specific to his profession, balancing competence with a deep, earned vulnerability. The central contradiction between his “gently skilled” hands and the internal tremor of guilt is embodied effectively. His final change feels inevitable and earned by the preceding reflection, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively embodying the “logical dreamer” archetype through her methodical yet hopeful actions. The characterization is strong, showing her shift from seeking a lost person to continuing a legacy. The final choice is earned, but the initial internal conflict between her logical mind and the visions is more stated than dramatized in-scene, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from a duty-bound inheritor of a "burden" to a purposeful guardian. Her interiority is concrete, though the final emotional shift feels slightly too neatly articulated. The character arc is earned through discovery, but a stronger sense of in-scene contradictory impulse, rather than a linear discovery-then-acceptance path, would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Maya’s motivation is powerfully established through the “borrowed heartbeat,” which serves as both a compelling backstory anchor and an in-scene physiological barometer of the stakes. Her defining contradiction—the “perceptively calm” exterior hiding an urgent, thrumming core—is masterfully shown through her calculated brushstrokes. The final moment, where she sets down her brush with “infinite grace,” provides a perfect, earned closure to her arc within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in a personal history that has been transformed rather than merely overcome. The concept of her "particular brand of damage" is masterfully executed, making her the only one who could have broken the stalemate. The line "violence reformed into patience, fury into the slow art of listening" defines her contradictory impulses, which are then demonstrated in her climactic choice to reject ritual for raw admission.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vera's motivation is exceptionally clear and complex, rooted in the potent contradiction of her public amorality and private, sentimental preservation. The character is compellingly drawn, and her internal conflict drives the narrative. The score is held back from the 9-band by a moment of over-articulated self-awareness—"here was proof that even monsters could mourn"—which momentarily replaces embodied feeling with a thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyralei's central paradox is compelling, and her motivation is clear and consistent. The story powerfully connects her unique training to her revolutionary act. However, her interiority sometimes shifts from embodied experience to abstract, authorial reflection ("The alarming thing about serenity, she had learned..."), which slightly distances the reader from her immediate internal struggle during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus is a well-realized and consistent character. His core motivation is clear, and his urbane serenity is believably contrasted with his revolutionary artistic goals. The backstory of diplomatic calligraphy provides a solid foundation for his methods. The characterization is slightly weakened by a tendency toward self-aware, diagnostic interiority, as seen in phrases like "he'd learned long ago," which summarizes his philosophy rather than letting it emerge purely from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s motivation is crystalline and her actions are a direct, embodied expression of her philosophy. The characterization is successful through its unity of purpose, with interiority focused on the task and its meaning. While there is little internal conflict in the traditional sense, her unwavering focus becomes a compelling character trait in itself, earning the final moment of renunciation. Her choices are consistent and reveal a deep hierarchy of values honoring impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elsa's motivation, rooted in her craft and past guilt, is clear and compelling. Her specific skills as a caster provide a unique lens for understanding the central conflict of preservation versus transformation. However, her key epiphanies are sometimes articulated in overly diagnostic language, such as "memory wasn't about perfect preservation but about transformation," which reads more like a thesis statement than an organic, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative forward. The re-contextualization of her "precisely playful" nature from a personality quirk to a "survival mechanism" is a sophisticated and powerful move that lands well. While her interiority serves the conceptual plot more than it reveals deep emotional contradiction before the climax, the final turn toward acceptance is earned and functions as a form of Earned Stasis with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, framing her frugality not as poverty but as the purchase price for her goal. This single-mindedness provides a powerful engine for the short narrative. While her interiority is sparse, her dedication is convincingly portrayed through her actions, culminating in a final choice that feels earned by her established character.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Brother Marcus is a well-realized archetype, and his motivation is clear and consistent. However, his competence and foreknowledge are so absolute that he lacks any visible internal conflict or doubt during the scene, which flattens his characterization. The Magistrate's transformation is the story's focus, but he functions more as a thematic obstacle than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Elara's blend of practicality ("Glass can only show what light allows") and inherited mysticism is perfectly balanced and drives her unique solution. The astronomer's motivation is embodied in the shattered sextant, making his desperation tangible. The final choice to provide a mirror that carries the dream, rather than just recreating it, is an earned action rooted in Elara's established wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between a grief-born vow and present duty is compellingly embodied. The moment of self-deception with the "wrong bag" is a strong micro-choice revealing her true desire. A minor weakness is the overly articulate realization—"She knew that wisdom isn't preserved through isolation but through teaching"—which verges on diagnostic self-awareness rather than a purely in-scene emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    The curator's motivation to understand the anomaly is clear and sustained. Her internal state of "temporal vertigo" is well-embodied, and her professional training provides a credible counter-impulse ("retreat to logic's foundation"). The micro-choice to seek refuge in the bathroom is a brilliant character beat, grounding a high-concept crisis in a moment of human vulnerability, which directly facilitates the climactic insight. The final state of being "bewildered still but purposeful" represents a perfectly earned shift for a story of this nature.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and her competence is well-established, but her interiority lacks depth. The final, story-altering choice to share knowledge rather than hoard it reads as a clever intellectual solution, not an emotionally earned change born from visible internal conflict. Her character is functional and drives the plot, but she remains more of a lens for the concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific: not just to find a twin, but to “recapture… the proof that she’d existed.” The internal conflict is beautifully rendered in the phrase “trapped freedom,” showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to pocket the card is a perfectly earned renunciation of ease for the sake of memory, a micro-choice that reveals a deep hierarchy of values with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation as an archivist is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her competence is well-established through her practiced, instinctual movements. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction; she moves from curiosity to understanding with methodical proficiency, but we don't feel a deep internal struggle or a difficult trade-off in her final choice, which reads more as a triumphant discovery than a costly sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and her competence is expertly drawn through her precise actions. Her character is defined by a unique worldview—reading the world through patterns—that is consistent and compelling. The portrayal is very strong, lacking only a deeper sense of internal contradiction acting in-scene to achieve the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira's characterization is compelling, rooted in the potent and clear motivation of a seventeen-year vigil. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through specific sensory details tied to her retrocognitive gift ("feeling backward through time"). Her shift from maintaining a dead beacon to actively rekindling it is earned by the inciting incident, and her competence feels balanced with the immense weight of her long-held, lonely duty. The final choice is a direct result of her unique perception and stubbornness, making the climax feel inevitable and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and her arc is coherent, but her interiority, while poetic, borders on overly-articulate diagnostic awareness. Lines like "This consciousness of loss, she conjectured, was what made them human" feel more like a cleanly summarized thesis than a messy, embodied epiphany mid-crisis. Her competence is established, but a lack of demonstrated flaws or internal contradiction slightly flattens her character, making her journey feel more like an intellectual proof than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaia’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively externalized through her chant. The shift from a solitary wanderer to a community leader is plausible, though the ease of this transition feels frictionless. The supporting cast's immediate and total buy-in slightly lessens the weight of Kaia's struggle, making her competence feel less tested against internal doubt or external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mira's motivation is shown through her patient, observant actions, while Chen's is revealed through his dialogue and interaction with the cicada. The internal conflict—Chen's fear versus his life's purpose—is resolved through Mira's focused empathy, making his eventual turnaround feel both earned and inevitable. Their professional relationship provides the perfect crucible for this philosophical debate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mira's motivation—to find a silence that isn't her father's fearful compression—is clear and compelling. Her internal conflict is dramatized beautifully through the contrast between the bunker memories and the trellis's reality, and the final choice to bring her father a vial is a perfectly earned, compassionate act that shows her growth without erasing her past.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus is a well-realized character whose competence and empathy drive the story. His motivation is cleanly anchored in his past experience. However, he verges on being a flawless archetype—the wise ferryman—and his final lines veer into articulating the story's thesis, which slightly undermines his individuality in favor of a thematic function.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Anya's motivation as a lore keeper is clear and consistent, driving her actions from start to finish. Her intellectual transformation is earned through the on-page discovery process. However, her interiority reads more as a functional processing of information than a deeply embodied experience, and the "wisely adventurous" trait feels more like a label than a demonstrated internal conflict with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The keeper's characterization is strong and specific, with a motivation rooted in a believable, if metaphorical, history of trauma. Her interiority is revealed through her interaction with the shadows and the key object, showing contradictory impulses (the pain of severance vs. the purpose it provides). The concept of "careful devastation" is a particularly sharp piece of character-specific thinking that elevates the portrait beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina's motivation is clear and her internal state is well-established through her grounding ritual with the pendant. The transformation from a "bitter and bright" laugh to "pure music" effectively signals her arc's completion. However, the epiphany feels slightly unearned, a sudden shift in understanding rather than a struggle, and the stated "virtuously mischievous undertone" is a label that lacks on-page dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Victoria’s motivation to be the "dynasty ender" is clear and earned through the story's core revelation. Her internal conflict is legible, and the final choice to renounce the family gift is a powerful change with a felt cost. The characterization is strong, though a small deduction is warranted as the final moments verge on self-aware summary rather than pure, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aldric’s motivation is conceptually clear and consistent with his transformation, but his interiority lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory impulse at the threshold of choice. The final surrender feels inevitable rather than a victory over a competing desire (e.g., fear of dissolution, attachment to self). His transformation is beautifully rendered, but the preceding micro-choices read as steps in a known process rather than a struggle against a tangible internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb. Marcus’s motivation is rooted in a specific, painful past, and his internal conflict—the need for archaeological healing versus the desire for present connection—is established efficiently. His final choice to build a “counter-narrative” is not a sudden epiphany but an earned crystallization of his purpose, with the cost of his isolation made clear. His actions are perfectly aligned with his interiority, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization leans on the archetype of the underestimated youth who possesses a singular, decisive talent. Her interiority is competent but lacks contradictory impulses; her path to victory feels too assured. Jakob serves his purpose as an intel source and an audience for exposition but has little agency or depth of his own.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his grandfather's legacy. The central conflict is beautifully embodied in the action of "almost playing," a powerful external expression of an internal struggle between creation and deliberate restraint. The cost of this choice is made palpable through the "ghost-memories" of unplayed melodies and lost futures, giving weight to the final earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and her shift from duty to curiosity is well-grounded in her connection to her grandmother. The central micro-choice—building monuments instead of reporting the speck—is a strong reveal of character. The transformation is earned within the story's magical logic, though the line "the euphoria of finally comprehending one's purpose" verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly diluting an otherwise embodied emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation evolves credibly from a simple desire to fix things to a complex acceptance of his role. The internal conflict is perfectly captured in the phrase "uncertainly certain," which frames his initial choice to keep the compass and his final renunciation of his old purpose. The character’s final stance is earned through a sequence of observation and action, representing a significant and believable transformation with a clear, felt cost—the abandonment of his original calling.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s character is well-realized, with her motivation and internal conflict embodied in her gold-seamed face. Her bitterness and empathy create a compelling contradiction. However, Mira’s final realization is articulated in dialogue that feels more like a thematic summary than an earned, personal epiphany, slightly flattening her arc at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on some archetypal shorthand ("modestly fearless"). The story's weakest point is the dialogue during the climax. Mara's line, "This is how we integrate laughter into healing," reads as diagnostic label-speak, an authorial intrusion that momentarily breaks the established voice and lessens the emotional impact of an otherwise earned moment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, with a specific and compelling interiority rooted in the proprioceptive enhancements. The internal conflict between practiced terror and calculated analysis is embodied effectively, not just summarized. The final choice is earned, and the closing line—"feeling the exact pull of seventeen facial muscles"—is a perfect, character-particular payoff showing her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear and tied to her unique gift and personal history. Her interiority is conveyed through tangible actions and sensory details, such as her "fingers trembling." The characterization is strong, but for the highest tier, it lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict; her path forward is direct and unopposed once the opportunity arises, missing the contradictory impulses that define a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his professional competence ("skillfully observant") is demonstrated through action, not just stated. His progression from investigator to the bearer of a legacy is earned. The characterization is slightly held back from the highest tier by a lack of sharp internal conflict; his path to discovery is linear and competent, with minimal self-doubt or contradictory impulses shown in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Moth's character is defined by a powerful internal contradiction: she is the meticulous curator of a perfect system, yet she is drawn to the "rustling awakenings" in the spaces between definite states. This contradiction provides a clear and compelling motivation for her final choice. The transformation from guardian to willing destroyer is earned, flowing directly from this established trait.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.5)
    Cassia's characterization is exceptional, seamlessly integrating her backstory as a failed revolutionary into her present motivation. The link is explicit and powerful: "Perhaps it took a failed revolutionary to recognize another civilization's last desperate attempt at preservation." Her internal conflict between past defeat and new purpose is embodied, culminating in an earned and complex final state where sorrow becomes a tool for clarity. This is a masterful execution of a character finding a new, more profound revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias Thorne is a functional and motivated protagonist, but his characterization lacks depth. The core weakness is the unearned epiphany ("understanding flooding through him") which resolves his central problem without a visible internal struggle or trade-off. While his competence is well-established, he reads more as a wise artisan executing a pre-destined solution rather than a character facing and overcoming a genuine moment of doubt or limitation. Councilor Vex serves his purpose as a one-dimensional antagonist, applying pressure effectively but without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera's motivation is lucid and her defining trait, "sensibly eccentric," is masterfully paid off in the final beat. The choice to retreat and prepare, rather than yield to impulse, is a potent demonstration of character. This decision, a form of Earned Stasis, is earned by the narrative's consistent portrayal of her as methodical despite her arcane profession.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina’s motivation is clear and her internal change is earned. However, her interiority sometimes becomes overly articulate and abstract, stepping out of an embodied perspective. The thought, "This was how to scaffold complexity with simplicity," reads more like an authorial thesis than an organic, in-the-moment realization from a sculptor, slightly flattening the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply integrated with her actions. Her interiority is specific, rooted in her artistic sensibility, and the story earns her final shift from investigator to participant in a tradition. The choice to paint the hands instead of another flower, and then to hide the postcards, demonstrates a credible character change with a felt cost—the embrace of anonymity over personal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amara's motivation is clear and her internal state of "temporal vertigo" is well-embodied. Her role as an archivist gives her a specific, credible lens through which to process the stakes. While her actions are largely guided by Marcus, her final internal shift from archivist-as-preserver to archivist-as-witness-to-complexity feels earned. The characterization is strong, though slightly limited by the story's conceptual focus.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in his established identity as a heretical alchemist whose life's work is predicated on memory as possibility. The core conflict between taking the "easy path" and his defining attribute of rejecting "false comfort" is perfectly dramatized in the central choice. The final action is a direct, earned consequence of his established beliefs, fulfilling the 9+ test by resolving a core contradiction with a visible cost (the hours-long ordeal and destruction of his creation).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Matthias’s motivation evolves credibly from a professional duty (preserving languages) to a profound personal mission (archiving emotion). The backstory of the third-grade epiphany is perfectly integrated, providing a specific, character-rooted origin for his final insight. The final choice to transcribe the prophecy and accept his role as archivist is an earned change, supported by a consistent and well-realized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb. Mira’s interiority is conveyed through potent, contradictory phrases like “furiously tranquil precision” and “wild serenity,” which are earned by the high-stakes, delicate actions she performs. Her motivation is deeply rooted in her lineage, and her competence is established through reflections on past lessons, making her climactic success feel inevitable and earned. The final shift from keeper to continuer represents a meaningful change with the felt cost of immense responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between modern data and ancient intuition is well-dramatized. Her final choice aligns perfectly with her established values. However, the final paragraph's summary of her transformation ("switch from observer to guardian") is too explicit, slightly undermining the earned, embodied change by labeling it for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the internal arc from loneliness-as-weakness to vulnerability-as-strength is earned. Interiority is concrete and particular, especially for a non-human POV, with moments like "synthetic fingers trembled" providing effective embodiment. The final change feels like a genuine, earned shift in perspective rather than a stock epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation that evolves from survival to stewardship. Her interiority is specific and her final choice to accept her role feels entirely earned by the preceding revelations. The contradiction between her ingrained solitude and her acceptance of a communal burden provides a potent, quiet conflict that resolves with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is more of a vessel for the story's concept than a character with deep internal contradictions. His motivation is clear, but his acceptance of an immense, world-altering purpose feels preternaturally smooth. The description of him feeling time's texture ("the rough sandpaper of anxiety, the silk of contentment") is a strong conceptual beat, but it reads more like an elegant summary of a state rather than an embodied, in-scene struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's motivation to find harmony in brokenness is clear and consistent, driving her actions from observing the feather to interacting with the boy. Her interiority is concrete, though it sometimes borders on being too articulate about its own themes. The boy serves as an effective external pressure, forcing her philosophy from passive observation into active practice, making the final earned stasis of her reinforced worldview credible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from a personal crisis into a profound purpose. Her shift from facing a "death sentence" to accepting an "appointment" is an earned epiphany, driven by the concrete actions of her work. Her interiority is rendered with precision, moving from the initial sting of diagnosis to the "brazen calm" of her final understanding, embodying a complete and credible character arc within the tight word count.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s characterization is exceptional, hinging on the potent internal conflict between her "luminous skepticism" and the evidence. This contradiction acts in-scene, driving her investigation. The final, earned transformation of her rebellion into a recognition that even her doubt was part of the design provides a powerful, costly character closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coachman's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-integrated with his backstory as a driver of death-carts. His interiority is specific and revealed through his unique actions, such as using dead languages. The character serves the story's thematic purpose flawlessly, though the absolute singularity of his purpose leaves little room for on-page internal contradiction, which keeps it just shy of a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sage's motivation is clear and her arc from a jaded retiree to a hopeful summoner is compelling. Her backstory as a corpse-finder provides a potent foundation for her transformation. The final choice is earned, but the character's interiority is slightly undercut by thematic summary in the last paragraph, which shifts from embodied experience to a more abstract declaration of her new role.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her relationship with her grandmother. The internal conflict—accepting her "curse" as a tool—is resolved through a well-earned epiphany, making her final choice to become a "lighthouse" feel both inevitable and costly. Her interiority is concrete and specific, avoiding generic emotional labels; the transition from blessed pariah to purposeful anchor is powerful and earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Renn's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, evolving from fulfilling her master's instructions to embodying a more profound philosophy. The internal conflict between certainty and wonder is powerfully externalized in her climactic choice. While the interiority occasionally leans towards summary ("he'd never understood the true test"), her subsequent actions provide the necessary dramatization, making the final renunciation of her master's legacy feel earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marina's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in the profound irony of her public misidentification as a "crisis actor." Her interiority is sharp and specific, avoiding cliché; the shift from rescuer to a "fiction in service of someone else's narrative" provides a powerful internal conflict. The final choice to refuse the government's call is a perfect crystallization of her established values, an earned renunciation of a world that trades in "large lies" for the "small truths" she now serves.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The seer's motivation is clear and potent, and her internal conflict between the pain of memory and the need for recovery is embodied through specific, non-visual sensations. The final choice to plant a future rather than just unearth a past represents an earned, decisive change, demonstrating a complex internal shift with a legible cost—the acceptance that her old self can only be transformed, not reclaimed.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaspar’s motivation is clear and compelling, but the final moment of self-forgiveness is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity. The line "he saw himself clearly for the first time: not a failure, but a teacher who had done his best with incomplete knowledge" reads like a summary of therapy rather than a raw, embodied epiphany earned under pressure. This abstraction slightly undermines the powerful setup of his internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, her interiority sometimes serves as a direct mouthpiece for the story's theme ("Words are prisms," "This is the price of forgiveness..."), which feels slightly less like a character thinking under pressure and more like a thematic statement. This tendency toward over-articulation keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is clear, consistent, and potent, driving her to risk everything for her final act of preservation. Her identity as "both" stubborn and broken is established early and paid off by her endurance. The internal state is well-embodied through her trembling hands giving way to a voice of gaining strength, showing a believable progression under pressure. A minor weakness is the final moment of understanding, which feels slightly too articulate and self-aware for a character plunging to her death.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's characterization is consistent and her core internal conflict is well-established. However, her final epiphany is delivered almost entirely through her grandmother's journal, making her a recipient of wisdom rather than an active agent in its creation. The final thematic summary feels more authorial than a natural conclusion for a character defined by aloofness.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied. The internal conflict—purifying grief into forgiving love—drives the entire plot. However, the story leans on abstract, high-flown emotional labels like "screaming tenderness" (used twice) and "gentle violence," which slightly dilute the specificity of her interiority at peak moments instead of letting the action carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marina’s motivation is powerful and deeply embodied; her physical struggle while cranking the array is a perfect externalization of her internal conflict between duty and personal longing. Her contradictory impulses—the desire to follow the migration versus the need to stay and guide—are resolved into a credible, earned stasis. The line where she tells Diego she walked the path herself, admitting her own past struggle, is a masterclass in revealing character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and powerfully embodied through her involuntary confessions. The internal conflict is masterfully shown when her truthfulness forces her to admit her own doubts about the cure ("I'm afraid it won't work"). The final shift from personal salvation to social responsibility is earned and represents a profound character change with a clear, felt cost—the burden of choice and mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.6)
    Magnus’s characterization is exceptional, with his peculiar gift serving as the engine for both his interiority and the plot. His motivation to understand the boutonniere evolves seamlessly into a deeply personal quest to reclaim his past. The final change—pinning the flower to his own jacket—is a powerful, earned gesture of reintegration, with the cost of his lost decades providing immense weight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation is deeply rooted in his established traits of loneliness and passive regret. The internal conflict between his safe, anchored life and the pull of the promise is palpable. The final transformation is earned through the story's causal chain, and the cost—the forfeiture of his static but wealthy existence—is clear, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seraphina’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on labels like "familiar rage" and "disenchantment" rather than fully embodying these contradictory states through action or perception. Her final choice is more an acceptance of inevitability than a visceral, conflicted decision, which slightly softens the impact of her sacrifice. While strong, the characterization stops just short of the deep internal friction expected for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lyra’s internal conflict between scientific precision and romantic intuition is embodied through her actions—clutching the shell while analyzing equations. The final change, from "You did it" to "We did it," is earned and demonstrates a profound shift in her understanding, moving from an isolated pursuit to a shared one. Marcus serves as a perfect catalyst, applying gentle but precise pressure that forces her crucial insight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya's characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal conflict between her desire for order and the encroaching chaos of her existence. The contradictory impulse is dramatized beautifully in her envy for her other selves' certainties versus her own jaded knowledge. The final micro-choice to step outside is an earned, character-particular act of acceptance, with the cost—her linear self—felt throughout the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, rooted in a specific, motivating loss that informs her every action. Her interiority is concrete and unique, defined by touch and sound. The final choice to refit the screw loosely is a perfect micro-choice that embodies her entire philosophy, demonstrating a change earned through the scene's pressure. Mrs. Huang, while brief, is rendered with potent emotional weight through gesture and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira's interiority is exceptionally well-embodied; her stress is not just stated but made manifest in the crystallization, which serves as a brilliant physical correlative for her internal state. The central contradiction between her formal scholarship and the suppressed folkloric wisdom from her grandmother is dramatized effectively, providing a clear and compelling engine for her climactic choice. The final shift from shame to empowerment is earned through the crucible of the test, meeting the 9+ standard for contradictory impulses resolving with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vera's motivation and internal conflict are strong, and her change of heart is earned within the story's length. Her contradictory impulses—professional skepticism versus dawning guilt—act in scene, culminating in her choice to collaborate. The final internal metaphor of the dance feels slightly too neat, preventing a higher score, but her arc is compelling and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kaia’s transformation from a passive "scholar" to an active arbiter is exceptionally well-earned. The motivation is clear and deepens from preservation to understanding to participation. Her internal conflict between witnessing endings and needing to transcend them is resolved in the climactic action of unification, and her final laugh is a superb moment of embodied, paradoxical emotion that validates her new state with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority lacks true conflict. She functions more as a thoughtful conduit for the story's philosophical inquiry rather than a character with contradictory impulses under pressure. While her final realization is earned, the journey to it feels more like a serene meditation than a struggle, limiting her dramatic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s arc from professional isolation to personal vulnerability is clear and well-motivated by the story's central discovery. However, the character's internal thoughts and final dialogue ("boundaries don't have to be barriers") slip into diagnostic label-speak, explicitly stating the theme rather than embodying it. This over-articulation at the story's peak emotional moment slightly flattens an otherwise solid characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elena’s internal contradiction between her professional certainty and her personal chaos is palpable and sustained. Her motivation is clear, and the final choice feels like an earned evolution, not a sudden reversal. The stranger is a well-executed catalyst, reflecting Elena's conflict back at her, though she borders on being a thematic device rather than a fully-realized character. The shift from "theoretically rebellious" to active participant is compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear and compellingly strange, rooted in a chosen asceticism that feels earned. His interiority is concrete, especially in his tactile relationship with the glass disc. The contradiction between cultivating distance while seeking a form of intimacy is the story's engine. A slight deduction for the pseudo-profound dialogue ("Every ending is just a beginning..."), which reads more like an authorial thesis than an organic utterance, momentarily flattening his unique voice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional. Her internal conflict between professional duty (truth) and personal compassion (mercy) is not merely stated but embodied in her actions. The final choice to add the codicil is a perfect synthesis of her contradictory impulses, earned by the preceding reflection. Her professional identity as an archivist provides a rich, specific lens for her worldview, making her motivations both clear and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Sadie's persona as a "professional ghost" with a "desperately jocular edge" is established immediately through voice and action, and her core contradiction—an elusive loner building networks of human connection—is compelling. The moment her mask slips ("That's everything") provides a powerful glimpse into her earned sincerity, making her final philosophical statement feel rooted in experience rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her unique capabilities are well-established. However, her characterization remains more archetypal than individual; she is a vessel for the story's beautiful concept rather than a person with palpable internal contradictions. The final epiphany feels preordained rather than earned through a dramatized struggle, as she moves through the forest with serene competence and no moments of significant doubt or flaw-driven missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira's motivation, rooted in professional guilt, is clear, powerful, and sustained. The internal conflict between erasing her mistake and preserving a profound discovery is dramatized with nuance. The final choice to embrace "confident uncertainty" is a perfectly earned culmination of her intellectual and emotional journey, foreclosing the path of easy absolution at a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Maya’s motivation to give form to silence is made concrete through the ritual of the empty camera, a powerful and particular character detail. The relationship with Chen acts as a perfect crucible, forcing the shift from private ritual to shared creation. The final change, where Maya accepts her new artistic language, is earned through the preceding action and feels both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's motivation is compelling and consistent, creating a powerful central irony. However, some interiority is conveyed through summary ("wasn't proud of her past") rather than being fully embodied in contradictory in-scene impulses. The core transformation is earned, but relies more on reflection than on-page choices under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her final act is a well-earned culmination of her established rebellious nature. The interiority is strong, though the internal conflict is presented with such certainty that a moment of embodied doubt or fear before the climax could have added another layer of depth.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marcus's motivation is exceptionally clear and his competence is demonstrated through action rather than assertion. His defining traits—patience, quiet observation, meticulousness—directly compel the final choice to give away the coin, which is an earned renunciation of his unique power to force the system to learn. Chen’s transition from panicked authority to humbled student is credible and dramatized effectively through her gait and dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Characterization is strong and consistent for both Mira and Thomas. Mira’s motivation is clear and her actions align with her core trait of silent teaching. However, Thomas's internal epiphany is articulated with a degree of diagnostic clarity ("love spoken in actions echoes longer than words frozen by death") that feels more like a narrator's summary than a raw, character-bound realization, slightly undermining the moment's emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, and his actions are consistent with his established traits. However, his characterization lacks significant internal contradiction within the scene; he reads as a near-perfect, benevolent mentor figure. Elena's final unspoken realization ("We're not learning to win. We're learning to question why anyone should lose") feels slightly too articulate and thematically neat, delivered via Marcus's telepathy, which serves as a convenient narrative shortcut for a complex idea.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-realized. However, the characterization is weakened by moments of diagnostic label-speak, particularly Torven's explanation of his grandfather's journal and the narrator's summary of his recognition ("one soul seeing another clearly"), which replace embodied emotion with an analytical gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb, particularly the earned, subtle shift in Mrs. Chen. Her motivation is deeply rooted and her final adoption of the performer's technique feels inevitable. The performer's enigmatic nature serves the story's core concept perfectly, functioning as a catalyst rather than a fully legible person, which is a sophisticated choice for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas serves as an effective vessel for the story's concept, with clear motivation rooted in his identity as a poet. His interiority is concrete, but occasionally veers into articulating the story's theme directly, as in "They never understood that the poets simply paraphrased..." This slightly flattens his individuality, making him more of an archetype. The emotional arc is more aesthetic and philosophical than deeply personal, which fits the tone but limits the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong, with both Mira and Enzo exhibiting clear, earned motivations that are revealed through action rather than exposition. Mira's "innocently cunning" nature is deftly shown in the initial barter, using subtext and observation as her currency. Enzo's transformation from a guarded craftsman to a vulnerable father is credible because it's forced by Mira's precise application of pressure. The contradictory impulses—Enzo's twitch toward the reed tongue while dismissing it—are particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is effectively dramatized through her choice to improvise on the bells. The connection to her grandmother provides a concrete, particular history for her values. The transition from bell ringer to "architect of moments" is earned, though the final paragraphs articulate this shift with slightly more diagnostic clarity than a top-tier piece would allow, nudging into self-awareness that softens the final embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elena’s interiority is rendered with precision, particularly the contradiction between her ability to guide others and her hesitation to commit to her own healing, embodied by the phoenix stencil. Her final turn towards acceptance feels earned, not through a dramatic event, but through the quiet crucible of helping another. The embodiment of emotion is subtle and powerful, as when a smile is described as "still feeling foreign on her face."

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera's characterization is strong and consistent, defined by her unique profession and competence. However, the story demonstrates her success rather than a struggle; the absence of a visible internal conflict or a difficult on-page choice, where her values are tested, keeps the characterization from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira's motivation to purify the plague is compelling and drives every action. The character's internal change is earned through the escalating trials of the pagoda, and her final choice feels inevitable given her established commitment. The concept of an "unpatterned consciousness" is brilliantly tied to both her external tactics and internal capacity for transformation, creating a deeply coherent protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from professional curiosity to profound personal purpose. The final micro-choice to transcribe her grandmother's vision is earned through the preceding investigation and the emotional weight of the climax. The interiority is concrete, especially the "luminous regret," which feels specific and earned rather than a stock emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Marina's internal conflict between her conservationist ideals and her desperate actions is made concrete and visceral through her focus on the surgery. Her motivation is clear and complex, and her final shift toward confession is earned by the preceding act of atonement. The line, "But I was using your pain to save myself," is a powerful, earned moment of self-realization that avoids diagnostic cliché through its simple, direct confession.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya's motivation is compelling and consistent, rooted in the potent internal conflict of seeking closure by creating new wounds. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-specific lyricism ("vegetable grief"). The final epiphany, while earned, is articulated with a clarity that verges on diagnostic self-awareness ("she'd been trying to create spaces for miracles to enter"), slightly flattening the emotional complexity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s motivation is clear and evolves compellingly from professional duty to personal stewardship. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-specific detail tied to her unique abilities ("seeing the booth not as a room but as a vessel"). The final micro-choice to take the film strip demonstrates a clear hierarchy of values (sacred memory over professional detachment) and is earned by the preceding emotional accumulation, making for a credible and moving character arc within the brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s motivation is singular and potent, rooted in her unique perception of the cosmos. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in her experience of the stars' "whispered confessions." The final choice to sacrifice herself is a believable culmination of her seventeen-month obsession, making the cost feel earned. While the internal conflict is more of a focused drive than a struggle between contradictory impulses, its intensity is compelling enough for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kess's motivation is exceptionally clear, embodied in her actions and her connection to the frozen clock and fractured lullaby. Her dreamlessness isn't just a label; it's a perceptual filter that defines her relationship with the world. The choice to defeat the pirate not with force but with a deeper mastery of the world's new rules ("she sang the fractured lullaby louder") is a powerful, character-driven resolution that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the transformation from amnesiac observer to purposeful creator happens via an externalized info-dump rather than an earned internal struggle. While the final epiphany is powerful, the character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a person with contradictory impulses. The interiority is rich in description but lacks the texture of a mind grappling with its own limits before the final, sudden clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina's motivation is clear and deepens effectively from a simple external goal (find dog) to a profound internal need. The transformation is earned, culminating in the final image of her open hand and star-punched heart. The ferry guides are effective archetypes, but the female guide's line, "Unused courage waits in the spaces we create when we stop gripping so hard," verges on thematic summary, slightly flattening the earned epiphany that follows. It's a minor slip in an otherwise strong, embodied character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus's motivation to remain and understand is clear and embodied in his frostbitten nerves, a strong physical anchor for his internal state. His micro-choices—keeping the bolt, observing the step—are consistent and reveal his values. Elena's reveal is powerful, though her dialogue ("The fortress taught me...") verges on articulating the theme directly, slightly flattening her as an individual in that moment and making her more of a thematic vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Syln’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a powerful sense of duty. However, her interiority lacks significant conflict; her path from discovery to action is linear and certain. The pretender serves his function as an antagonist but reads as a somewhat one-dimensional archetype, particularly in his dialogue, which slightly flattens the climactic confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her grandmother's legacy. Her interiority is well-drawn, particularly the blend of scientific observation and intuitive searching. The transition from a solitary, repetitive existence to a decisive, risky action is earned. A minor weakness is the slight tendency toward summary, as in "The same determined eyes that saw beyond surface tragedies," which articulates a connection rather than fully embodying it in a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira's characterization is strong, particularly the initial trait of being "awkwardly confident," which transforms into something "ancient and sure." Her motivation is clear and consistent. The epiphany feels earned, but the moment of realization relies on a slightly generic phrase—"felt the thunderous serenity of understanding wash through her"—which momentarily labels the emotion rather than fully embodying it, holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Chen's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies more on summary ("Chen had learned to trust...") than on dramatized internal conflict. Her resolve is unwavering, which makes her a strong figure but less complex. The other characters, Li and the lieutenant, serve as functional pressures or plot devices rather than fully realized individuals, which is acceptable for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Amira’s interiority rendered through concrete, embodied specifics like the "somatic markers" and the "pearl of stillness." Her motivation is clear and her final stance of endurance is earned through on-page struggle. The slight use of diagnostic language ("Dr. Mansour had taught her") is the only element that pulls this back from perfection, but it is quickly grounded in specific action, maintaining high authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina's motivation is compelling, rooted in a professional and existential crisis. The internal conflict is rendered with specificity, particularly in the moment she sees her past, present, and future selves in The Moon card. The final shift is earned, and the cost is made tangible in the line "cracked and luminous with grief for her old way of seeing," which beautifully embodies the change.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character concept is strong—the tracker's "serene anger" and "consciously wild" methodology are intriguing hooks. However, these traits are more asserted than dramatized. We don't see her wildness lead to a meaningful trade-off or mistake, nor does the serene anger manifest as a tangible internal conflict driving micro-choices; she remains a highly competent, focused observer. Her transformation into "Understanding" is a logical conclusion to her experiment but lacks a visceral, embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.4)
    Vera’s motivation is powerfully rendered, rooted in a past relationship and a professional oath that creates a compelling internal conflict. Her transition from archivist to agent of change is earned, culminating in the line "Vera smiled with the terrible peace of someone who'd finally chosen their history," which perfectly embodies the cost of her conviction. The internal conflict—betrayal versus a higher loyalty—is dramatized with nuance rather than just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, especially for Mira, whose interiority and motivations are rendered with concrete, particular detail. The father’s transformation is earned through the contrast with her steadfast practice, culminating in a credible, resonant action. The line about him sheathing his weapon with the "deliberate care of someone learning a new language" is a masterclass in showing character change through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kova's characterization is exceptional, defined by the potent contradiction between her external "cool-headed" discipline and the internal chaos she must master. This is dramatized perfectly in the climax, where her fear and longing are made manifest by the garden even as her training holds. The final transformation into someone who carries the goddess's echo feels earned, a direct result of the seven years of preparation and the visceral struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.5)
    Margot's motivation is exceptionally clear, and her internal conflict between journalistic truth and dynastic preservation is dramatized through her actions, not just stated. The choice to renounce honesty is earned by the powerful reflection on her family's history, culminating in the perfect, costly gesture of locking the pen away. The final laugh being "both mournful and amused" is a masterful touch of contradictory, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara is a compelling archetype, but her interiority remains somewhat flat; she is more a vessel for a unique gift than a character experiencing internal conflict. Her competence is absolute, which slightly lessens the tension of her task. The motivation is clear, but the transformation is external—in the firmware and her pendant—rather than a deeply felt internal shift earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong, with Seraphina's artistic sensibility providing a consistent and compelling lens for her interiority. Her internal conflict between imposing order and accepting chaotic emergence is well-dramatized. The final change is earned through the story's accumulative logic, with the cost being the renunciation of her old creative paradigm.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sarai's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "aberrant mercy." The internal conflict between her guilt and a deeper compulsion is well-dramatized through her actions. The final shift in her motivation is earned by the story's central magical event, though the concluding internal monologue ("cradling empathy in arms of steel") borders on being too neatly articulated for a character in her position, slightly flattening the embodied emotion of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Cornelius's motivation is singular and powerful, and his unique synesthesia is not just a trait but the fundamental lens of the story's reality, consistently embodied in concrete sensory details like "cardamom and looked like spiraling gold." The shift from missing the "honey-copper" of applause to the richer, blended flavor of love fulfilled provides a tangible, earned emotional arc. The final choice to embrace an eternal encore with Isabella is a perfectly rendered conclusion to his stated desire.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya's motivation is clear and compellingly embodied through her "somatic markers," a strong, specific choice that avoids generic interiority. David functions effectively as the "affectionate skeptic," providing the necessary pressure to trigger the demonstration, though his rapid conversion feels slightly convenient for the story's length. The characterization is strong, but the final paragraph's summary of Maya's "willowglass hope" slightly undermines the earned emotion by stating it too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira’s motivation is compelling and evolves organically from documentation to translation to facilitation, a shift earned by the story’s central discovery. Her interiority is rendered through a specific, augmented sensory experience, avoiding cliché. The final change is paid for with the tangible cost of the fossil's destruction, externalizing her internal transformation and foreclosing her previous role.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's transformation from maintainer to creator provides a clear arc, but her pivotal realization feels more like a declarative statement ("Mara understood her true purpose now") than an embodied, earned epiphany. The shift lacks a visible internal struggle or a meaningful cost, making her evolution feel frictionless and slightly too neat for a character confronting the nature of fate itself.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margot’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her transition from three years of compressed anger ("You let me burn") to acceptance is very swift. While necessary for the story's length, the internal conflict feels more summarized than dramatized in the moment of choice. Her character is effectively drawn, but the turn relies more on the logic of the plot reveal than a deeply felt, contradictory internal process on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Thomas's motivation is articulated as a "perfect purpose," and his interiority is conveyed through his unique, non-analytical perception ("percolate through ambient awareness"). The woman is sketched with minimalist precision—"pale, determined, carrying the weight of someone else's broken promise"—making her an effective catalyst without needing extensive backstory. The interaction reveals their characters under the pressure of this quiet, magical moment, and Thomas's final choice to act is a fully earned expression of his established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mei's characterization is exceptional, with her potter's past providing a consistent and specific lens for her interiority, actions, and perception ("movements precise as throwing porcelain"). Her motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The integration of her past profession into her present mindset feels seamless, making her a unique and memorable individual rather than a generic post-apocalyptic survivor.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina’s motivation is clear and poignant, rooted in her connection to her grandfather and her garden. Her interiority is concrete, though it occasionally verges on being too self-aware, as when she thinks the gauge "measured the distance between isolation and connection." This slightly over-articulates the subtext, but her final, embodied action of placing the gauge is a powerful choice that demonstrates her internal shift with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kira's interiority is concrete and compelling, rooted in the specific conflict between her ancient memories and modern isolation. The primary weakness is the articulation of her epiphany, which verges on diagnostic self-awareness. The exchange with Marcus ("We're here to coexist with its absence." / "Independence from our old roles...") feels more like a thematic summary than an earned, messy moment of realization, slightly flattening the peak emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's characterization is strong, with clear motivation and compelling interiority. Her central conflict—being a translator of others' love while struggling with her own connection—is well-established. However, her internal monologue and final lines of dialogue occasionally feel too thematically articulate, shifting from authentic character thought to authorial thesis, as in "whimsy was simply wisdom wearing dancing shoes."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established, creating a capable protagonist. However, her interiority often relies on labels like "cautiously hopeful" or "smiled grimly" rather than fully embodied emotion. The characterization serves the plot efficiently, but lacks the deeper, contradictory impulses or specific internal textures that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The core contradiction of a "prudently adventurous" claustrophobic explorer is strong and well-established. However, the claustrophobia itself, after being introduced as a primary internal obstacle, is neutralized by the music rather than actively managed or overcome by the character's prudence. This makes the resolution of his internal conflict feel slightly unearned, as the central challenge is magicked away rather than confronted through character choice in the story's middle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sarah's characterization is strong and her motivation is clear, rooted in the compelling hook of her prosopagnosia. Her methodical process is shown, not just told, and serves as a powerful anchor. The characterization is slightly weakened in the final paragraph by a shift into over-articulated self-awareness ("she had learned to recognize something deeper"), which reads more like a thematic summary than earned, in-the-moment interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, progressing from intellectual curiosity to a sense of inherited duty. The shift from "nervously confident" to "certainty" is earned through discovery. However, her internal emotional state, particularly the "spongey dread," relies on labels more than embodied contradiction; the transformation to "weight of inherited responsibility" is a neat summary rather than a felt, messy process under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marla's motivation to understand the impossible is clear and her internal conflict over self-forgiveness is well-integrated with the central magical object. The brief backstory reflection on her past regrets lands effectively, providing concrete examples for the "pixelated amnesty." The final change to accepting her past is earned through the story's supernatural logic, representing a strong and coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus is a compelling, well-realized character whose motivation is clear and consistent. His defining trait of "perceptive calm" is demonstrated through his methodical actions rather than being merely stated. Chen serves as an effective foil, the "smartest mark" who is capable of understanding the lesson, making the climax a meeting of minds rather than a simple victory. The dialogue in the final scene, while slightly too articulate in its thematic summary, effectively serves the story's conceptual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by the need to understand the burden that drove her predecessor mad. Her interiority is well-established through her focus and exhaustion. However, her core attribute—the ability to "heal with words"—feels more like a label than an active, consequential trait; its application at the end feels generic ("softening the edge," "heal their isolation") rather than a specific, costly act that the story has earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait—"warlike serenity"—is not just stated but embodied in his actions, providing a strong, consistent core. The story earns his final shift from seeking exoneration to embracing his ancestor's sacrificial burden. This internal change, driven by the central discovery, feels inevitable and forecloses the initial path with the palpable cost of his and his order's reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in the evocative “root-bound” trait which is masterfully re-contextualized by the end. Her interiority is palpable, particularly the “anxious elation.” However, for the highest echelon, her internal conflict lacks a moment of genuine, dramatized hesitation; her journey from curiosity to acceptance is a bit too smooth, making her “purposefully curious” feel more like a given state than a choice made against an opposing internal force like profound fear or a desire for normalcy.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, rooted in her “reckless” idealism. The internal conflict is clear, culminating in a choice that is both surprising and inevitable. Her final state, a fusion of her own traits with Elena’s, is an earned change that feels both costly and empowering, satisfying the 9+ quick test. The keeper serves as an effective catalyst, externalizing the story’s core question without overstaying their welcome.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Marcus’s internal conflict between detached professionalism and buried grief is dramatized through his actions, from the precise cataloging of the cloth to the involuntary memory it triggers. The contradictory trait "confidently uncertain" is established early and paid off in the final phone call, where his confidence is no longer a performance. His final choice is earned by the preceding emotional arc, with the cost being the full acceptance of a painful past he had tried to compartmentalize.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sarah's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in her "haunted ambitions." The internal conflict between her "scholarly detachment" and the desire for full immersion is well-drawn and culminates in a choice that feels earned. The link between her "kindly methodical nature" and its role as "preparation" provides a satisfying character payoff. The characterization is strong and avoids cliché, successfully earning the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaine’s characterization is strong and embodied, with her titan-gear harness serving as a perfect externalization of her internal state. Her motivation is clear, but its direct articulation—"This was why she remained—to preserve wonder in routine"—borders on thematic summary rather than purely character-driven interiority. The visitor functions effectively as a catalyst, but remains more of a reflection for Kaine than a distinct character.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her arc from professional detachment to vulnerable action is well-earned. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively in the moment she decides to carve her confession. The interiority, however, occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language ("vulnerability felt too much like the disasters she spent her life preparing against"), which slightly undermines the raw emotion of her breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Marcus’s motivation is rooted in a specific, haunting failure, and his contradictory impulses—the methodical scientist versus the emotionally frozen man—are dramatized effectively. The final change from obsessive documentarian to someone accepting forward motion is earned through the scene's internal struggle, showing a genuine, costly shift in his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist is a functional vessel for the story's concept, and her transformation from seeker to keeper provides a clear arc. However, her interiority lacks significant conflict or contradiction; she solves the puzzle with a competence that feels frictionless. The key emotional state, "cautious exuberance," is stated rather than fully embodied, making the character feel more like an archetype than a particular individual grappling with a profound mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is excellent, driven by a well-dramatized internal conflict between ambition and integrity. Her contradictory impulses are held in tension until the climax, where her final choice is earned with a visible cost. The line about her lie tasting of "mulberry wine, sweet and bitter" perfectly embodies this complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character concept of a beautician-mortician is compelling and well-integrated. Motivation is clear and potent. However, the final paragraph's explicit explanation of her dual roles—"A beautician knew... a mortician knew..."—reads as a thematic summary, slightly undermining the earned interiority of the moment by stating what the preceding action had already beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a well-defined internal conflict between forgiveness and the loss of purpose. Her interiority is concrete, and her core attributes are demonstrated through action, culminating in a credible character change. The line "Contentment died with those scrolls" provides a sharp, visceral anchor for her journey, and the final shift to earned stasis feels resonant, a direct result of the story’s mystical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    The internal contradictions of both characters are sharply drawn. The Arbiter's professional detachment versus their insightful method, and Marcus's "sincerely insincere" grief, create a compelling dynamic. The final change in Marcus—the shift from wanting absolution to accepting the burden of choice—is earned by the preceding pressure, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and her actions are consistent with her stated trait of weaving truth carefully. Marcus serves his role as the recipient of knowledge effectively, with his shift from confusion to understanding feeling earned. The characterization is very strong, held back only by the final lines of dialogue which feel more like a thematic pronouncement than a character's authentic speech, slightly flattening her voice in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yula's motivation is crystalline and her endurance is earned, but the core internal conflict between movement and stillness is presented as a settled matter from the past ("She had come here... believing... Now... she understood"). While this establishes her resolve, it forgoes the tension of a character actively struggling with contradictory impulses in the present scene. The characterization is a strong, resolved portrait rather than a dramatized, in-the-moment crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-embodied in the act of dropping the medallion. The transformation is earned through the central scene. However, the final internal monologue, while summarizing her change, borders on over-articulated self-awareness ("The missed note that made the song human..."), slightly flattening the nuance of her embodied experience into a tidy thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlow's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in her relationship with her sister and their shared condition. Her interiority is specific and filtered through her unique perception. The climactic choice to accept the vows feels like a natural culmination, though the internal shift from a lifetime of hiding to sudden acceptance is rapid. The contradiction is stated more than it is felt in a moment of genuine, embodied struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voss's characterization is exceptional, defined by the central contradiction between her "stellar doubt" and "quiet enthusiasm." Her motivation—to understand her purpose—is clear and intensifies until the final, earned epiphany. The resolution, where she embraces her eternal role, is a powerful form of endurance that feels inevitable given the story's logic, making the cost of her static existence palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is palpable, leading to an earned final stance. Interiority is mostly concrete, but a few moments, like directly identifying the Kraken as "her own fear of drowning in sorrow," veer close to diagnostic self-awareness rather than an embodied, in-the-moment realization. This slightly undermines the otherwise strong character work.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in professional obsession and personal history. Her defining trait—understated power combined with meticulous intellect—is demonstrated rather than stated, making her final success feel earned. The characterization is slightly weakened by the final paragraph, which summarizes her qualities for the reader rather than letting her final actions speak for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus's shift from technical observer to moral witness is clear and well-motivated by the discovery of the photograph. His interiority is strong, especially the crystallization of fragmented memories. A minor deduction is for the slightly too-articulate summary of his own motivation ("spinning the fragments into shared meaning"), which reads more like a thematic statement than an in-the-moment realization and momentarily steps out of character.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s internal conflict between logic and sentiment is well-realized and drives the plot. Her motivation is clear and her final choice is earned with a visible cost—the loss of the crystal. The interiority is strong, though a few epiphanies, like realizing intuition is logic's "twin," are articulated with a neatness that slightly undercuts the mystery the story otherwise cultivates.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Maya’s shift from dutiful employee to committed guardian is motivated and earned. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her hesitation and the physical tic with the parachute buckle, which reveals her history and current anxiety without exposition. The final choice feels like an inevitable crystallization of her established values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to overcome numbness is clear and compelling. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through phrases like "terrifies the part of me that still remembers terror," effectively embodying his contradictory state. The final choice to create a new consciousness is earned through the sparring session and Master Chen's guidance, representing a credible and profound shift in perspective with a clear cost—the abandonment of his former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted organically in her profession as an escape room designer. Her interiority is strong, though it occasionally relies on declarative summaries of understanding ("She understood with the clarity...") rather than fully embodied discovery. The final choice to accept her new role is well-earned and consistent with the established character, representing a credible evolution from puzzle-maker to guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus's motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait, "mournfully eager," is beautifully embodied. The characterization is strong and consistent, with actions aligning perfectly with his stated goals. However, the backstory of the "previous conductor" feels slightly convenient, serving as a quick explanation for his unique knowledge rather than letting it emerge with more mystery or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a powerful and specific interiority. The conflict between the guardian's feral nature and her human homesickness is dramatized effectively through her choice to trust the scholar. The line "The monastery's walls had become her skeleton, its sealed windows her eyes" is a masterful piece of character-through-setting integration, making her final transformation feel deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is strong and consistent, driven by a well-established sense of injustice and stifled potential. However, his interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate thematic summary, such as "Destruction was just creation wearing a different mask," which reads less like an in-the-moment thought and more like an author's thesis statement. This slight lack of organic interiority at key moments keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative effectively through her specific, professional actions. Her interiority is vivid and particular, especially when interfacing with the celestial signals. The final decision to change her life's work is a credible outcome of her discovery, though its declaration feels slightly summarized ("she'd already decided") rather than experienced in a final, decisive moment of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his core trait of being "resiliently positive" feels more like a convenient label to sidestep existential dread than a dynamic quality tested by the plot. While his actions align with his ultimate goal, the interiority lacks a sharp, contradictory struggle in the moment. The positive resilience is asserted rather than embodied through a difficult choice with visible cost, making the character feel slightly too smooth for the profound events he orchestrates.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The architect's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains largely conceptual. Her core internal conflict—maintaining the balance between logic and dream—is stated as a condition for her work rather than dramatized as an active, embodied struggle with visible micro-choices. The "unsettling calm" is an effective descriptor for the tone but reads as a static trait rather than a maintained state with a felt cost, making her feel more like a vessel for the story's ideas than a person experiencing them.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara serves as a competent and credible lens for the story's conceptual reveal, but her interiority is more observational than conflicted. Her motivation is clear—to teach—but she lacks any internal contradictions or difficult micro-choices. The final emotional beat, where the "somber marvel... settled into her bones like pressure," provides a nice moment of embodiment but the character arc is one of awareness rather than change earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority occasionally dips into summary with phrases like "a guardian of vulnerable voices." The final paragraph's articulation of her heroism feels like an authorial thematic statement rather than an earned, in-character realization, slightly flattening the emotional arc at its peak.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is powerfully established through her promise and embodied in her struggle against a specific, recurring fear (claustrophobia). The internal conflict between duty and terror is not just stated but demonstrated in key moments, like her chest tightening in the Phase Lab. The final decision for Earned Stasis—to bear witness in silence—is a credible and costly resolution that flows directly from her established loyalty.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus's motivation to understand his paradoxical existence is clear and compelling. The interiority is well-handled, particularly the use of the heartbeat to ground his emotional state. However, the final pivot to "begin teaching others" feels abrupt—a summary of a future goal rather than a choice emerging from the immediate crucible of the scene, which slightly undermines the earned feeling of his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    The storyteller’s motivation is singular, potent, and elegantly established. Her character is revealed entirely through her actions and unique perceptions, avoiding exposition. The final transformation into a bone tower is a profound, earned change that pays the ultimate cost for her goal, making her renunciation of self both credible and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina’s core motivation is clear, and Thorne’s grief is palpable. However, the pivotal turn relies on an unearned epiphany ("Marina understood suddenly"), which shortcuts the difficult work of earning a character change. The final paragraph shifts from embodied emotion to a diagnostic summary of transcendence, weakening the believability of Marina's ultimate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is established with precision through her connection to the locust shell and her "gap between knowing what she must do and understanding what it would cost." Her interiority is concrete, especially the translation of heartbeats into melody, which grounds her unique competence. The final choice is an earned renunciation of safety, beautifully captured in the idea of playing oneself "empty," making the cost both personal and visible.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ezra’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his "respectfully rebellious" nature. His interiority is concrete, especially in his trust of the "gaps in documentation," which is a strong character-revealing choice. The Keeper, while brief, is an effective catalyst. The final paragraph's articulation of his understanding ("he understood that his...mail route was more than defiance—it was an act of faith") borders on a too-neat epiphany, slightly diminishing the earned ambiguity of his prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Emil's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his belief that "silence was not emptiness but possibility." The final change is earned through the story's accumulative pressure, and his choice to sing feels like a necessary, character-driven culmination. The contradictory impulses of ingrained silence and sudden impulse are dramatized effectively, resulting in a credible and moving transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's characterization is exceptional. His motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his relationship with his grandmother, and his "sanely eccentric" trait is demonstrated through his specific rituals rather than just being stated. The internal conflict between his logical mind and his intuitive search is palpable. The final change—a shift in understanding rather than action—is earned by the preceding accumulation of thought and memory, and the cost is the quiet continuation of his solitary search.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply rooted in her grandmother’s legacy. The climax presents a sharp internal conflict where contradictory impulses—duty to the past versus self-preservation—act simultaneously, embodied in the visceral cost of feeling a "warmth" leaving her. The final choice to renounce the quest is an earned change, foreclosing a path with a clear, felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s motivation is clear and her defining trait, "unassumingly bold," is effectively dramatized. Her competence is balanced with a tangible struggle ("fingers bled"). The characterization is strong, though her interiority sometimes relies on slightly abstract declarations ("she welcomed the vertigo") rather than more deeply particular, embodied sensations, which holds it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Margaret's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in her identity as a folklorist and her personal history. Her competence is balanced by the emotional weight of her task, and the final change—from seeking personal memory to shouldering a communal history—is earned and impactful. Interiority is strong, especially the "familiar thrill of discovery," which feels authentic to her character.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong. Elara's embodied tic of walking backwards is an excellent tell, and Kess's arc from sharp-edged grief to dawning understanding is swift but credible. The relationship dynamic is the story's engine, captured perfectly in the phrase "combative tenderness." The only slight weakness is that Elara's final lines verge on articulating her own motives a bit too cleanly, but Kess's earned change ("eyes that had aged years in an hour") grounds the moment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear and her competence is well-established. Her character is revealed through her unique actions, aligning perfectly with her history. The characterization is very strong, but for the highest tier, a more present internal conflict or contradiction acting within the scene itself, rather than pure resolve, would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira is a well-realized archetype, a competent and empathetic vessel for the story's magic. Her motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. However, for the highest tier, her characterization lacks a potent internal conflict; she operates with a singular, unwavering purpose, which, while fitting, bypasses the opportunity for a more complex choice or visible internal contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from professional curiosity to personal participation. Her interiority is concrete, and the final shift from a "guarded expression" to "shielded openness" provides an earned, albeit quiet, character change. The characterization is strong and specific to her profession, avoiding stock traits and creating a believable, intelligent protagonist whose skills drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina's motivation is crystalline and established early through her professional history, making her the perfect recipient for the captain's "invitation." Her interiority is intellectual and consistently filtered through her expertise, avoiding generic emotional responses. The final earned change is a conceptual affirmation rather than a dramatic reversal, culminating in the micro-choice to write the note—a subtle but powerful act that completes a seventy-three-year-old conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Chorus’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is conveyed through her unique actions—building the amplifier, singing to machines—rather than deep introspection, which suits the story's lyrical mode. The character arc, culminating in her acceptance of a new purpose, is earned. The story is held back from a higher score by a lack of significant internal conflict or contradiction; her path feels determined rather than chosen under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and evolves beautifully from professional duty to a deeply personal recognition of a shared purpose. Her final choice to continue Thorne's legacy is an earned change, rooted in the preceding discoveries and representing a credible, costly shift in her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from her refusal of rescue to her specific observations. Her interiority is specific and filtered through her unique obsession, avoiding stock phrasing. The characterization is more a portrait of profound commitment than a study in internal conflict, but this focus is a strength, culminating in an earned intellectual shift rather than an emotional reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and her unique condition is well-realized through her actions. The internal arc is strong, but the final epiphany ("her condition wasn't a limitation but a different kind of sight") feels slightly too self-aware and articulated, bordering on a diagnostic summary rather than a purely embodied realization in a moment of crisis. The contradiction is resolved a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her defining trait, diligent curiosity, is demonstrated through consistent action. The concept of "sociable isolation" provides a unique and specific interiority. However, the characterization lacks a moment of significant internal conflict or doubt; her journey is one of serene competence, which slightly flattens her arc from great to merely very good.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and deepens effectively from a desire to fix a past failure to a need to transform her entire craft. Her internal conflict between haste and patience is well-dramatized through the reflections in the mirrors. The final change feels earned, though the prose summarizing her new understanding ("repair not just the mechanism but the relationship...") borders on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly diminishing the raw impact of her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marina's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she is a purely altruistic force, which suits the fable-like tone but misses the complexity expected at the highest tier. The community's shift from suspicion to trust is the core character arc, but it's dramatized collectively rather than through a single, deeply explored individual, limiting its emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus serves as an effective vessel for the story's concept, but his interiority feels more reactive than conflicted. His transition from a technical adjuster to a mystical singer is an unresisted, seamless epiphany, lacking the friction of a genuine internal struggle. The motivation is clear, but the characterization is subordinate to the high concept; he understands and accepts without a moment of doubt, which lessens the earnedness of the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a central contradiction: she tells a saving lie about a shelter while having painstakingly made that lie true. Her motivation is clear, and her final choice to give away the walnut—the symbol of her hope—is a powerful act of renunciation that earns the story’s quiet, devastating stasis. The conflict between her desire for freedom and her ingrained duty is felt in every action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Marina’s internal conflict—her systematic mind versus her pained heart—is shown through her repeated, failed attempts to compose a text. The epiphany feels earned, not given, and her final choice is a renunciation of her core flaw (rigidity) with a visible cost: the release of the chrysalis, a token of her grief and control.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    Merrick’s transformation from a merchant of absence to a curator of perpetual beginnings is both credible and moving, earned entirely through the scene's interaction. The child’s motivation is powerfully simple and avoids sentimentality. The story perfectly executes a character arc through a single, decisive choice, with the cost—the dissolution of his original business model—made tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Miran's motivation is clear and evolves convincingly from personal healing to communal salvation. Her core trait ("sturdy in the way of desert things") is well-articulated but demonstrated more through a single climactic choice than through a series of smaller, contradictory actions. The interiority relies on elegant summary ("salt and sorrow") rather than fully embodied, messy feeling, which slightly distances the reader from the "sandstorm" of her emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marta's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth due to the absence of meaningful internal conflict or struggle. She is presented as almost preternaturally competent, executing her plan without doubt or error. The "empathetically decisive" trait is shown, but she reads more as a benevolent force than a flawed individual tested by a crucible, which limits emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization serves the story's high concept more than it reveals a complex, contradictory individual. Interiority is articulate and fits the "helix-minded engineer" persona, yet lacks embodied emotion or internal conflict; she proceeds on a linear path of discovery without struggle. The transformation is asserted rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orin's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by professional curiosity and duty. The characterization is effective for the story's conceptual focus, but interiority remains somewhat intellectualized. The "prism-mind" is a fascinating trait, though its direct impact on moment-to-moment choices could be more deeply dramatized beyond the one key perception in the grotto to elevate the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's motivation is crystalline and her competence is beautifully rendered. Her unique perception is shown, not just told, through her interaction with the tree. The characterization is slightly held back by a lack of internal conflict or a moment of doubt; her success feels preordained, making her more of a perfect conduit for the theme than a character struggling against genuine opposition, even internal.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.4)
    Viktor’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a potent internal conflict between reclaiming past glory and embracing hard-won wisdom. His motivation is clear and consistent, and his final choice to stay is an act of Earned Stasis that feels both inevitable and profound. The passing of the worry stone is a perfect, embodied micro-choice that transfers his legacy, making his renunciation of the Academy a victory rather than a defeat. The character reads as a fully realized individual, not an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her unique characterization as a "pacifist who fought battles through frequency" is well-established. However, the epiphany feels slightly unearned and overly articulated. The line "Mara understood suddenly..." tells the realization rather than fully embodying it, making the internal shift feel more like a sudden insight than a deeply struggled-for change in a high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's internal conflict between ambition and patience is well-realized, and her arc toward earned stillness feels credible. The change is embodied in her actions rather than merely declared. While her characterization is strong, a few moments of interiority lean toward the abstract, such as the description of her understanding shifting "from intellectual to embodied," which slightly distances the reader from the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kessa’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent and professional, fitting the "intrepid pilot" archetype. The characterization is highly competent for the story's length and focus. It stops short of exceptional due to a lack of significant internal contradiction; her arc is one of intellectual discovery rather than deep personal change, which is a valid but less complex choice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya's motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves logically from professional duty to a higher calling. Her actions are consistent with her role as a highly competent investigator. However, her interiority, while functional, relies on slightly generic phrasing like "understanding crystallized" and she lacks discernible flaws or internal contradictions, which makes her feel more like a perfect instrument for the plot than a fully textured individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and interiority is uniquely rendered through synesthesia, but the protagonist lacks compelling flaws or internal contradictions, reading more as a perfect vessel for the story's theme rather than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kessa’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from her trembling fingers to the final, revolutionary performance. Her internal state is well-embodied through her interaction with the environment, particularly the oppressive silence. The transformation from a failed guardian to a pioneering keeper is earned through a decisive, high-stakes choice, with the cost of her past failure felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira’s internal conflict—the "lucid turbulence" of accumulating selves versus her analytical drive—is rendered with specificity. The shift from seeing emotion as mathematics to typography is an earned change, not a summary. The final image of her smiling with "seventeen different mouths" is a powerful, concrete embodiment of her transformation and its cost, fully satisfying the 9+ test of a choice with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with her central internal conflict—the self-perceived flaw of her tremor—becoming the key to the resolution. The motivation is clear, and the transformation from nervous courier to resonant bridge is earned by the climax. The final realization reinterprets her core trait with a felt cost, making the arc satisfying. The only minor weakness is the slightly too-neat summary line, "Corvin's greatest discovery had been her all along," which verges on telling rather than showing her newfound significance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vera's motivation for professional validation is sharp and consistent, driving every action. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly in the moment her own emotions crystallize into frost, which earns the final shift. The characterization is strong, showing her contradictory impulses—decades of disciplined observation meeting a profound, spiritual revelation—without resorting to summary. The final choice is earned and forecloses her path of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mei’s motivation is primal and unassailable, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The interiority is superb, especially the moment she catalogs the specific, precious memories of her daughter that the silence will claim. This avoids abstract sacrifice and makes the cost visceral and character-particular; the final choice is not just motivated but tragically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Korin’s characterization is strong, anchored by the potent re-framing of meekness as a form of listening. His motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in the choice to forge a tool of recovery, not violence. The merchant's transformation is slightly abrupt but serves the closure effectively, his recognition providing a necessary external validation of Korin's esoteric craft.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, driving every action from the opening beat to the final choice. The interiority is concrete and specific to her role as a sensory map maker. The final shift from seeking to mending is an earned change, not an unearned epiphany, emerging directly from the climactic revelation and foreclosing her old, solitary quest with the felt cost of an infinite, shared responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elsa's characterization is strong and consistent; her reticence is not a flaw but the specific quality needed for the resolution, which is an excellent turn. Her motivation is clear and her final choice feels earned. The line "She could be alone without becoming lonely" is slightly too diagnostic, an intellectual summary rather than an embodied realization in the moment, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is clear and evolves effectively from dutiful routine to cosmic purpose. The character is defined by her unique role, and her interiority aligns with the story's mythic tone. However, the pivotal choice to collaborate with her reflection feels more like a sudden, frictionless epiphany ("understanding finally") than a choice born from tangible internal conflict, which slightly lessens its dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is embodied effectively through the "unfamiliar rhythms" and the feeling of growing "heavier." The change from burdened recipient to willing student ("Teach me") is earned through the crucible of the conversation with Chen. The characterization is efficient and poignant, meeting the 9+ quick test as his final acceptance is a costly renunciation of his previous, simpler life.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's shift from a passive maintainer to an active transformer of meaning is profound and earned. The motivation is clear, rooted in thirty years of patient duty, and his final choice feels like the crystallization of a lifetime's work rather than an unearned epiphany. The character's interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly in his tactile connection to the sextant and the labyrinth.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.7)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal shift from solitary, failed rituals to collective, fragile hope is earned and compelling. Her interiority is rendered through specific, evocative metaphors ("scattered pearls from a broken necklace") rather than abstract labels. The final choice and the acceptance of its ongoing cost—the perpetual singing—demonstrates a profound and credible character change, satisfying the highest standards for a story of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ezra’s core motivation—to reconcile his overwhelming empathy with his need for solitude—is clear and compelling. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively when he must choose between retreating from the grieving woman and his instinct to help. His final earned stasis, where he finds a functional way to be compassionate, feels credible and lands with the cost of continued emotional vigilance. The characterization is strong, though a few phrases like "his gift and curse intertwined" verge on diagnostic summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila's motivation is compellingly simple and specific: she follows the impossible bread. The story masterfully translates her internal state—a quiet observer questioning her own sanity—into concrete action. The shift from seeing her awareness as a potential "madness" to a "ministry" constitutes a powerful and earned change, with the cost being the acceptance of a profound, lifelong responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and compelling, rooted in her centuries-long role. Her shift from meticulous preserver to a new founder is earned by the climactic revelation, representing a profound change in stance. The internal conflict between saving the parts versus saving the whole is dramatized effectively through her choices. The only slight hesitation is that her initial meticulousness dissolves almost instantly upon finding the founder's slide, a rapid but ultimately credible pivot under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mae’s motivation is clear and escalates believably from a professional goal to one intertwined with family legacy. The backstory on her failed attempts provides a strong rationale for her current, more personal strategy. Her internal state—the racing pulse against the steady voice—is well-embodied, and the final choice to sacrifice her access to this world for the sake of her father's "honest" legacy feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s internal conflict as a “luminous skeptic” is masterfully embodied through her bioluminescent implants, which provide a concrete, visual measure of her doubt giving way to acceptance. The motivation to understand her grandmother is clear and compelling, driving the narrative. The final change feels earned, a culmination of overwhelming sensory evidence rather than a sudden epiphany, with the cost being the collapse of her lifelong scientific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between memory-as-reproduction and spontaneous creation is well-realized. The change at the end is earned through the story's causal structure. The epiphany moment, while effective, relies on a slightly cliché phrase ("chest cracked open with understanding") which slightly tempers an otherwise excellent character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.4)
    Vera's motivation is sharp, consistent, and provides a powerful engine for the narrative. Her unique gift is not just a label but is embodied in her actions and limitations, culminating in the masterful callback in the final paragraph where her "hands didn't shake." The transition from a lonely archivist of truth to a revolutionary is swift but earned by the deeply personal stake of her grandmother's fate.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mariel's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent, establishing her as a capable, archetypal guardian. However, her characterization lacks a compelling internal conflict or a moment of struggle during the pivotal action. The "seasonal muteness" is an intriguing detail that is neutralized as a "gift" and thus fails to create an on-page constraint or cost, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a fully complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    M-47's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, driven by the need to resolve its fragmenting consciousness. The internal conflict is masterfully externalized through the ritual, and the shift in perception—from seeing fears as terrors to fuel—is a potent micro-choice. The final state of "complete incompleteness" is earned through the story’s causal chain, representing a profound and credible character change with a clear felt cost—the shedding of a simpler, if chaotic, prior existence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marta’s characterization is consistent, and her motivation as a quiet catalyst is well-realized through action rather than statement—her tilted head is a stronger character beat than any description. Elena's trauma is palpable and her transformation is earned. The supporting characters, Jorge and Mrs. Chen, are efficient archetypes who serve their purpose without distracting from the central arc, but lack deep individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her unique capability is well-established. However, her interiority feels somewhat thin, presenting her more as a vessel for the story's concept than a character with deep internal conflict. Her competence is nearly absolute, which lessens the sense of genuine struggle; the outcome feels preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.6)
    Marina’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a deeply felt internal conflict between a void and the artifacts of a life she can't remember. The contradictory impulses are dramatized perfectly in the final choice: she acknowledges the unbearable truth of her grief but chooses a path of gentle integration over total reclamation. This decision to rebury the memories, keeping only one, is an act of Earned Stasis that is both heartbreaking and powerful, demonstrating a profound and earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    The summoner’s motivation is expertly established and sustained through her meticulous, embodied actions. Her character is revealed through her competence and the subtle internal conflict shown when she sees the good futures she must also sacrifice ("loves that would never bloom"). This glimpse of cost adds significant depth, earning the final image of solitary peace.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, particularly Elara's. Her internal conflict between scholarly solitude and a yearning for connection is embodied in her unsent letters and her ritual with Marcus. The micro-choices—gesturing toward the kettle, producing the seal—reveal her values under pressure. Marcus serves as an effective crucible, his gentle "interrogation" forcing a choice that reconfigures her solitary world.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marina's motivation is clear and her internal journey is compelling. However, the internal conflict between skeptic and believer is stated more than dramatized. The final self-awareness ("translated her isolation into independence") verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the earned emotional complexity of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei's motivation is compelling and her internal conflict between familial duty and personal integrity is well-dramatized. The choice to confess feels earned, though the epiphany is rapid. Her backstory as a forger who has shaped history provides a strong foundation for the personal stakes, making her ultimate rejection of that power meaningful and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Senna's motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in her desire to understand the legacy of the shell and the echoes. The internal conflict is articulated well ("understanding brought sorrow, not joy"), but it is presented more as a summarized realization than a dramatized, embodied struggle with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. While her final choice is earned, the preceding emotional calculus could have been sharper and less declarative to achieve the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established, transitioning credibly from treasure hunter to a higher calling. However, her internal conflict is minimal on the page; she accepts her role with little friction or contradiction. The story tells us of her fifteen-year journey, but the pivotal choices happen with a sense of inevitability rather than a visible internal struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The net-mender's characterization is consistent and her motivation—to perceive hidden patterns—is clear and compelling. Her interiority is specific and aligns with her philosophical nature, particularly in her interaction with the tea whisk and fireflies. However, the character lacks significant internal contradiction; she arrives fully formed in her wisdom, which makes for a beautiful portrait but less of a dynamic crucible. A higher score would require seeing her grapple with a conflicting impulse in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus's motivation is exceptionally clear, and his final choice represents an earned, costly reversal of his core identity as a debunker. The internal conflict between his professional drive and his newfound moral responsibility is well-dramatized. The characterization is strong, though the final paragraph's articulation of his new understanding verges on being too neat, slightly diminishing the raw impact of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marlowe’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, anchored in the elegant concept of "variant allegiance." Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in her perception of the world through frequencies. While her competence is well-established, the central conflict is more of a difficult task successfully executed than an internal struggle that forces a costly trade-off on the page, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marcus's transformation from a passive collector to an active "translator" is clear and well-motivated. His interiority is specific and his final earned state is convincing. Elena serves her narrative function effectively, though she verges on a 'wise elder' archetype, which slightly flattens the character dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in ancestral duty and embodied in her physical actions. The internal conflict between her technical understanding (“the mathematics”) and her trembling hands is potent and believable. The final transformation is a powerful, earned change, with the cost of her humanity made tangible by the folded azure coat, satisfying the 9+ test for a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her seventeen-year dedication. The internal conflict between her "wildness" and her cultivated patience is dramatized effectively, particularly in the line "sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt." This is not just a label; it's an embodied action that defines her character and makes her final, quiet triumph feel earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Margot's transformation is compelling, but her climactic self-realization uses diagnostic language that feels overly articulate for a moment of crisis. The line "she was searching for the moment when survival became unbearable" summarizes her motivation with the clarity of hindsight, slightly undermining the raw, embodied experience preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly for Eliza. Her internal conflict is shown, not told, culminating in the line "He deserved worse... but maybe we deserve better," which beautifully captures a complex, earned shift without resorting to a simplistic forgiveness arc. The contradictory impulses are held in tension, making her final stance credible and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pioneer’s motivation is established effectively through the concept of a "yearning algorithm," and her actions are consistent with this drive. The characterization succeeds through her focused work and visionary dialogue, which contrasts well with Sprocket's pragmatic skepticism. While her internal conflict is more conceptual than embodied, her final, decisive action provides a powerful culmination of her established traits, earning the transformation with a clear, albeit metaphysical, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila's motivation is clear and compellingly evolves from professional duty to a personal quest, anchored effectively by the mission patch. Her core trait of being "brightly attentive" is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The final choice feels earned, though a brief flicker of internal contradiction or hesitation before committing would have elevated the characterization from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear, and her transformation is the story's centerpiece. However, her character feels more like a vessel for the theme than a person with contradictory impulses. Key moments of change are delivered through exposition ("understanding flooding through her") or overly articulate self-assessment ("They're bridges... Between what was and what could be"), which lessens the impact of her earned change by abstracting it.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.6)
    Marlene’s interiority is rendered with exceptional precision and contradiction. Her motivation shifts from a desire for annihilation to a need for understanding, an arc earned through the story's central metaphor. The final moment of renunciation—choosing to remain and listen—is grounded by the tangible cost felt in her palm, a perfect embodiment of her changed state.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus's characterization is strong, with a well-realized interiority rooted in his long-held grief and unique perspective. His motivation is clear and consistent. The only slight weakness is his final line of dialogue, "Every mismatch teaches us how to cultivate something new," which feels more like a thematic thesis statement than an organic utterance, slightly flattening his otherwise subtle voice at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and her commitment is demonstrated through action, culminating in the powerful gesture of removing her mask. However, her interiority reads as archetypal rather than deeply individual; she "understood immediately" and proceeds with unwavering certainty. A moment of internal contradiction or hesitation when facing the magnitude of the task would have added more depth and complexity to her character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but she operates as a flawless vehicle for the theme rather than a character with compelling internal conflict. Her transition from archivist to community organizer is frictionless, and her interiority is described with labels like "crystalline clarity" instead of being embodied through struggle or doubt. The character feels too perfectly calibrated to the story's needs, missing the contradictory impulses that create depth.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her character as a reticent scholar who prefers etymologies to people. The internal conflict between her quiet nature and the necessity of public testimony is palpable. The final choice to testify "in fractured sequences" is a brilliant culmination of her character and her discoveries, an action that is both a renunciation of the Committee's linear methods and an embrace of her own. Her "weathered innocence" is a specific, earned emotional state that elevates the characterization beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's speculative premise. Ezra's motivation is sharp and poignant—the search for "the exact sound of time passing through a human body"—and his internal conflict is beautifully dramatized through his cycle of forgetting and remembering. The final epiphany, recasting his curse as a "kindness," is earned and lands with profound weight, providing a powerful emotional resolution through acceptance rather than change.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Ezra’s identity as a "sage camera repairer" is not a label but the core of her methodology; her choice to use a modified camera and a tuning fork is a direct, earned extension of this expertise. Her motivation evolves credibly from reluctant guardian to a deliberate choice of purpose, with the cost of forgoing escape made clear. The internal conflict between escape and stewardship is dramatized, not just stated, culminating in an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s motivation is powerfully clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the moment she receives her diagnosis. Her interiority is well-drawn, particularly the initial image of her reflection "split between the grooves." The characterization is very strong, though it verges on the hagiographic; a moment of embodied doubt or a crack in her serene façade ("decisively kind hands that never trembled, even now") would have added a final layer of complex, contradictory humanity to elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and evolves logically from scholarly curiosity to galactic guardianship. Her core trait ("quietly deliberate") is demonstrated consistently in her actions, reinforcing her character. The final shift to her new role as guardian is earned by the preceding events, and the cost—a life of lonely vigilance—is effectively conveyed. The characterization is very strong, lacking only a deeper sense of internal contradiction to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Thomas's internal conflict—"yearning for the sister he'd lost and learning to love the one he'd found"—is not just stated but dramatized through his actions. The final, earned choice to return the tooth demonstrates a profound shift from a keeper of relics to a facilitator of the future, crystallizing his arc from a forgiving skeptic into a sure, if less certain, healer.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s motivation is clear and her competence as a gem polisher provides a credible foundation for the story's fantastical turn. Her interiority is effective, particularly the memory sequence that serves as the story's pivot. The character arc from solitary searcher to community teacher is earned and satisfying, but the final interior reflection articulates the theme a bit too explicitly, bordering on diagnostic summary rather than embodied feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kira's motivation is clear and compelling, and her actions, particularly proffering the moss, are powerfully character-revealing. The internal conflict between protecting her sanctuary and extending grace is well-dramatized. A slight tendency toward diagnostic self-awareness in phrases like "protected vulnerability she'd cultivated" keeps it from the 9+ band by summarizing an emotional state that is otherwise expertly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina's motivation is clear and evolves compellingly from a professional goal (finish the novel) to an existential renunciation. Her interiority is concrete and her contradictory impulses—to obsessively collect hope versus releasing it—are dramatized in the climactic scene. The final change is earned, but slightly weakened by the over-articulated epiphany ("her conflict had never been about finishing..."), which veers into diagnostic self-awareness rather than letting the final actions carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align perfectly with her goal. Her interiority is conveyed effectively through her gentle, determined focus. However, the character lacks a compelling internal contradiction; she is portrayed as a pure vessel for restoration without any significant internal struggle or flaw that complicates her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist is characterized effectively through her meticulous actions and singular focus, embodying her defining trait of patience. Motivation is explicit and unwavering, providing a strong engine for the narrative. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses, presenting her more as a flawless artisan executing a difficult task than a complex individual, which keeps it from the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb. Mara’s motivation evolves credibly from professional curiosity to a philosophical quest, and her specialized skills are demonstrated through unique, consistent actions. Her final choice to document rather than repair is a powerful renunciation, earned by the story's progression, foreclosing the initial path with a palpable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional, realizing Mara’s internal contradiction—being “boundary-lessly trapped and absolutely free”—through embodied action rather than summary. Her motivation is deeply integrated into the story’s physics, and the final resonant image of her father provides a psychologically earned anchor for her acceptance of this state. Her smile feels like a moment of genuine, complex insight, not unearned happiness.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear, earned emotional arc. Margaret’s interiority is specific and her transformation is credible. The primary reason it doesn't score higher is that some of her epiphanies, like "This was the lesson she was harvesting from loss," feel slightly too articulate and self-aware for a moment of crisis, bordering on thematic summary rather than a purely embodied, contradictory internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Kira’s internal conflict between past ambition and present reality masterfully externalized through the ghost. The motivation to account for her life is clear and drives the narrative. The final change feels earned, a transformation rather than a simple victory, though the line "Not surrender to eroded dreams, but recognition that some ambitions transform..." edges close to diagnostic summary in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire plot. However, her interiority lacks texture; the "struggle" is minimal, and her shift from solving equations to finding "hope" feels more like an asserted epiphany than an earned, embodied emotional change. Her competence is well-established, but the process of discovery feels too frictionless to fully test her character.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and her internal conflict between the safety of silence and the call of her former passion is rendered with concrete, embodied detail. The transformation of her musical impulse into elaborate script is a powerful piece of characterization. The final choice to “bear both worlds” is an earned, nuanced resolution that feels both surprising and inevitable, fulfilling the contradictory impulses shown throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and the parallel between her past and van der Meer’s is compelling. However, the epiphany feels over-articulated, especially in lines like "She'd run from that knowledge, seeking grander lies...". This diagnostic self-awareness reduces the sense of an immediate, messy realization in favor of a tidy summary, slightly undermining the internal conflict's raw embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear, consistent, and demonstrated through her actions. The character reads as a cohesive whole, driven by a specific philosophy. However, she lacks a significant internal contradiction or a moment of genuine struggle; her competence and patience are presented without a visible cost or counter-impulse, which slightly flattens the characterization into an archetype of a wise preserver.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s characterization is superb, realized through her unique, empathetic actions rather than exposition. Her motivation to find meaning in endings is clear and compelling, culminating in an earned epiphany about the nature of healing. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, with the central metaphor of mapping loss providing a concrete and non-diagnostic way to understand her internal state. Her agency is quiet but powerful, expressed through perception and the intimate act of documentation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aldric’s motivation is powerfully established and his final choice to accept the flawed bird is an earned change, representing a shift from idealism to a more profound pragmatism. His interiority is strong, particularly the embodiment of his exhaustion and hope. The characterization is held back from a higher score by moments of declarative thought ("What was life but organized matter?") that summarize his philosophy rather than dramatizing it in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Maya's internal conflict—the inherited hunger for fire versus her compassionate choice to save—is embodied in her "firefighter's hands" and the ritual she performs. The backstory of her first fire provides a concrete, earned basis for her character, and the final shift from grief to recognition feels authentic and hard-won. The contradiction is active throughout, culminating in a credible, resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus's motivation is clear, but his central transformation from "luminous skeptic" to a believer in wonder is asserted in the final paragraphs rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice or moment of internal conflict. The woman functions more as an archetypal guide than a character with her own contradictions. Consequently, the characters feel more like vessels for a powerful concept than individuals with complex, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Keeper's characterization is clear and poignant. Her motivation—"to share light without using fire"—provides a strong, paradoxical core. The internal conflict of "troubling serenity" is established early and resolved in the final beat with a credible shift to acceptance ("she had made peace with it"). The choice to endure is a valid and earned form of closure for this contemplative character.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Martha's characterization is strong and consistent. Her motivation is deeply rooted in her heritage and craft, and her internal state is rendered with specificity, particularly the "fiercely meditative state." The contradictory impulses—the weight of grief versus the calm focus of her work—are shown acting in scene. The final stance of quiet strength is earned through the completion of the work and the acceptance of her grandfather's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theodore’s motivation is powerful and his internal conflict is palpable, driven by a well-defined professional ethic. His obsession is embodied in the specific, tangible act of carving the rake handle. The transformation is mostly earned, though his discovery about the pendulum's pause feels more like a convenient mystical insight than a deduction rooted in his established mechanical expertise, slightly softening the character's otherwise grounded nature.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marta’s characterization is superb, with motivation and interiority seamlessly integrated. Her shift from containing grief via ritual (the chess clock) to embracing its creative potential is earned through patient action. The final choice to not restart the clock is a powerful, embodied renunciation that demonstrates her change with a clear, felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is a well-realized vessel for a powerful concept, with a clear and consistent motivation. However, her characterization lacks meaningful friction; she is preternaturally competent, conceiving and executing a flawless plan without any visible self-doubt, setbacks, or struggle. This perfection keeps her at an intellectual distance, making her feel more like an archetype of ingenuity than a person under tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mariel’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal history and a clear ideological goal, compelling her actions throughout the single scene. Her interiority is beautifully captured in the specific, contradictory phrase "thistled calm," avoiding cliché and embodying her serene focus amid great peril. Her micro-choices—adjusting the dial, mixing the dust, transcribing the forbidden song—all align perfectly with her established character, demonstrating competence balanced with the high stakes of her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marlene’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a core internal contradiction: she offers a final, gentle lie to fugitives while simultaneously acting as an agent of ultimate consequence. Her motivation is complex and revealed through action rather than summary. The choice to capture Creech "as he imagined himself" is a powerful micro-choice that demonstrates her specific, conflicted values with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's motivation is sharp, consistent, and tested. His internal state—a carefully constructed "abrasive calm" built on solitude—is effectively dramatized and then cracked by the climax, making his final choice feel costly and earned. The woman serves as an excellent foil, her own motivations revealing a depth that forces Marcus to reconsider his own. The shift from antagonist to ally is swift but credible, pivoted on the shared value of preserving truth.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maestro Chen's characterization is strong and consistent. Her motivation is clear, and her internal shift from "expectantly resigned" to fulfilled is earned and emotionally resonant. The backstory of unlearning hatred provides a credible, powerful foundation for her teaching philosophy. A minor weakness is that her interiority sometimes articulates the story's theme with a bit too much diagnostic clarity, as in "silence wasn't the absence of sound. It was the presence of listening," which feels more like a polished thesis than a raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, with interiority grounded in the unique sensory detail of tasting memories. However, her characterization lacks a compelling internal contradiction in the present moment; she is portrayed as wholly resolved from the start, which slightly flattens the emotional texture of her high-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in her grandmother's legacy and the immediate crisis. The internal conflict between her fear as a "thief" and her duty is well-realized, especially in her self-correction about being a liar. However, the final line's explicit statement of the theme—"some truths were meant to sting before they could heal"—reads as slightly too diagnostic, slightly unearned, pulling back from an otherwise embodied resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, moving from a "cartographer of the imperceptible" to an active participant. The character is defined by her unique perception, and her final choice to leave the shard is an earned renunciation with a clear cost, fulfilling her arc from witness to participant. Interiority is concrete and avoids cliché, particularly in the description of silence as an "active presence."

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Both Thessaly's and Marina's motivations are clear, and their internal shifts are earned and compelling. Marina's rapid move from academic to empath is compressed for length but lands with emotional truth, particularly in the line, "I think you were faced with only terrible choices." Thessaly’s transformation from a figure of judgment to one of witness is the powerful core of the story, fulfilling the character arc with a tangible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's characterization is exceptional, defined by a core contradiction: a man of pure logic grappling with profound regret. His motivation is clear and intensified by the Sarah backstory, which provides a devastating personal anchor for his abstract struggle. His actions—scarring the die, consulting his tattoos—are perfectly aligned with his "grim optimist" persona, and the final moment of "patient urgency" is an earned and resonant state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and compelling, moving from a well-embodied creative drought to an inspired, memory-fueled trance. Her interiority is specific, particularly in the daydream of the transformed shop. The final shift from isolated artist to community anchor is earned, though the transition feels slightly frictionless, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marta's motivation is exceptionally clear, deeply rooted in her professional duty and personal heritage. The story effectively dramatizes the internal conflict between her dread of loss and her determination to preserve history. The final shift from fear to a "fierce tenderness" is an earned emotional closure, a credible endurance that forecloses despair with the felt cost of inevitable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her unique skills are well-established. The story successfully embodies her internal state through her precise actions. The final emotional note of "bleak exhilaration" is a strong, earned contradiction, but her competence during the central task is so absolute that it lacks a moment of genuine, embodied struggle or doubt, slightly flattening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in past trauma that defines her present reality. The internal conflict between fascination and repulsion is well-embodied. The final choice to confront Fear with a paradox is an earned culmination of her journey, though the suddenness of the epiphany that "Fear was lonely" feels slightly less earned than the actions preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kessa's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established. Her interiority is focused on her task, effectively conveying her prophetic focus. The slight inconsistency between her "collapse" and feeling "no fatigue, only a restless euphony" at the end slightly undermines the felt physical cost, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. Her defining trait as a cartographer driven to understand patterns directly compels the story's key actions, from mapping the watchers' gazes to her final decision to map the unknown. Her internal state is well-embodied through concrete actions like a "hand that trembled," and the final choice is a powerful, earned expression of her established character, fulfilling the 9+ test of contradictory impulses (fear vs. need to know) resolving with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, and Marcus's internal conflict provides the scene's primary tension. His turn is earned within the story's economy. However, the explicit labeling of Elara's core trait ("Her emotional rationality had always been her strength") is a moment of telling in an otherwise well-shown character piece, slightly flattening her interiority at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb. Edmund's motivation is a seamless blend of professional duty and personal pilgrimage, creating a potent internal conflict. The attribute "stoically sensitive" is not just stated but demonstrated through his contained emotional reaction in the parlor. The final act of preservation is a perfectly earned culmination of his established character, with the "weight of witnessed absence" serving as a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear and her competence is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The characterization is strong, though it stops just short of greatness because her internal state, while consistent, lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory impulse. The phrase "dappled resolve, neither entirely certain nor wholly doubtful" provides a welcome touch of complexity to an otherwise seamlessly proficient character.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei's motivation is powerfully established and her "crafty nature" provides a credible throughline for her actions. The character arc is earned and internally consistent. However, a slight tendency toward summarizing her emotional shifts, such as "Mei understood then," keeps it from perfect embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amira's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in her backstory and driving every on-page action with precision. Her final state of "bleak exhilaration" is well-earned. However, the characterization of Dr. Chen is purely functional; his rapid conversion from shocked scientist to willing accomplice in a matter of moments lacks credibility and feels like a concession to plot velocity, slightly undermining the scene's realism.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kira's shift from a pragmatic archaeologist to a believer happens too quickly, making her motivation feel thin. Her defining trait, "perpetually surprised," is stated rather than shown through choices with consequence. The final epiphany, while clear, feels more like an absorbed lesson from the pilgrim than an earned internal change forged through struggle or meaningful internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's character is exceptionally well-realized for this length. The central contradiction—a forger of histories forced to confront his own—is potent and drives the narrative. His final choice is a renunciation earned by the preceding revelations, with the cost of his livelihood making the change credible and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is a compelling blend of personal grief, inherited wisdom, and professional duty, with her internal conflict between vengeance and principle dramatized effectively. Her “uncommonly thoughtful” nature is shown through action and philosophy, not just stated. Thorne’s guilt-ridden exhaustion is conveyed with powerful subtext, making the final, difficult apology feel earned and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-realized through his relationship with the compass and the poles. His final choice feels earned, though the epiphany catalyzed by the seal is slightly abrupt. Sarah serves her purpose as a compassionate foil, but her dialogue verges on being a thematic mouthpiece, slightly flattening her own characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's core motivation, stemming from the paradox of "guilt without memory," is compelling and consistently dramatized. His internal conflict is made tangible through his dialogue and his ultimate choice. The old woman serves her archetypal role effectively, but remains more of a thematic device than a fully-realized character, which is an acceptable trade-off at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained. The internal conflict is expertly shown, not told, in the line "I'm paradoxically steady in my uncertainty," which captures her simultaneous terror and resolve right at the precipice of her choice. This embodiment of contradictory impulses is high-level craft and earns the final transformation, making her change feel inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her internal conflict—the desire to separate her daughter's beginning from her mother's end. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-specific imagery ("words sharp as card edges"). The one minor vulnerability is the mother's dialogue ("I stayed long enough to see"), which verges on sentimental, slightly flattening the complexity established in the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—maintaining equilibrium between sorrow and joy—is well-conceived. However, the climactic moment where her "pacifist soul recoiled, but she held steady" is summarized rather than dramatized. A deeper dive into that moment of contradiction, showing the struggle instead of stating its outcome, would have made her final acceptance feel more hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the story toward its transformative conclusion. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into summary, stating her realizations ("she understood now," "her own understanding finally crystallizing") rather than fully embodying them. This slightly diminishes the immediacy of her internal journey, telling us the meaning of the moment instead of letting it land purely through her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thorne's character is consistent and well-motivated, his vigilance demonstrated through his practiced movements and knowledge. Amara provides effective secondary pressure, but her dialogue veers into thematic summary ("...it's about nurturing what comes after"), making her feel slightly less like a character and more like a mouthpiece for the story's message in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Yann's motivation is clear and her arc toward a new, weightier responsibility is earned. Her interiority is strong, particularly the feeling of being "trapped between knowing and doing." The change is a powerful conceptual shift rather than a physical one, and the cost—a lonely, lifelong covenant—is credibly felt in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Maya's motivation is nuanced—not just to resist, but to understand the "constellation of fear" in the censors' marks. Her state of being "furiously tranquil" is not merely stated but demonstrated through her calm, focused actions amid the storm. The backstory is efficient and effectively frames the present stakes without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Marlowe's motivation is rooted in a specific, costly past event that gives her a compelling intellectual and personal stake. The concept of being "diplomatically fierce" is established in backstory and then demonstrated in her interaction with Reeves, creating a satisfying loop. Her interiority is sharp, connecting the mechanical arm not just to loss, but to a new form of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is exceptionally clear, but the characterization relies heavily on summary and external diagnosis. Marcus's line, "You're multiplying yourself... each name is a different angle of light through the same prism," perfectly articulates her inner state, but it feels too neat, like a thesis statement provided for the reader. While her actions align with her motives, the interiority lacks contradictory impulses in the present scene, reading more as resolved philosophy than active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marion's motivation is exceptionally clear and viscerally felt, rooted in grief and a "strategically creative" hope that is demonstrated, not just labeled. Her defining trait directly fuels the central action of the plot. The final choice to improvise is a powerful, earned expression of her character under pressure, and the cost is made legible in Sophia's altered state, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her internal journey is the story's core. The internal conflict between her empirical training and the island's fluid reality is well-dramatized through her experience with the memories. The final choice is a direct, earned result of her "wakening" from a rigid worldview, showing a meaningful change with a clear professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kenji's characterization is exceptional. His internal conflict between a placid, controlled exterior and "diffuse and desperate" grief is embodied through his interactions with the bonsai and the lace. The motivation for his final, decisive change is earned through a slow accumulation of resonant insights, rather than a sudden epiphany, making his choice to finally write to Yuki feel both inevitable and profound.

    Mae's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied longing, rooted in the past-life memory that compels her choices, culminating in the earned renunciation of capturing to release; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses like tasting ancient heartbreak while pursuing healing. The ghost as secondary character applies pressure, forcing Mae's micro-choices under stress. Flaws complicate her journey without hedging, shown in her unconscious preparations. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, avoiding deeper irrationality in the climax.

The final realization earns stasis by confronting flaws with visible emotional cost, as in her palm pressing the forge to imprint recognition.

Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses between urgency and acceptance without stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seven's motivation to uncover thought origins drives consistent, intensifying choices like abandoning the mop, with interiority concretely embodied in sensor readings and timeline perceptions; however, emotions remain somewhat abstract without strong contradictory impulses in scene, though the final renunciation of curiosity for routine endurance carries a felt conceptual cost in the endless cycles.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marlowe's motivation for coded resistance is clear and intensifies through her mechanical arm's backstory, revealing internal conflict via embodied loss and audacity; however, emotions feel somewhat abstracted in philosophical terms rather than contradictory impulses in scene, as in the duel where her "diplomatically fierce" tone dominates without visible self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s shift from data-driven detachment to humble witness is embodied in daily micro-choices—resigning, building stations, letting dust settle.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—preserve vs. end the poisoned legacy—play simultaneously in the final beats; the renunciation to walk deeper into the canyon is earned by the frost’s wordless lesson and the felt cost of letting the world believe her dead.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tears freeze on her cheeks, fingers dance silently across keys—yet her contradictory impulses (grief vs. discovery) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of “lost music” is earned by the thermal symphony she has witnessed, but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s insomnia and inherited vocation are embodied in trembling hands and the “bubble of breathable grief,” but the leap from mortician to underwater librarian-undertaker feels more asserted than earned; the final renunciation lands with cost yet lacks a prior micro-choice that makes the shift inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marta’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“weathered hands paused on the bell rope”), her motives (dignity over charity) drive every micro-choice, and the final renunciation of credit is earned. Samuel’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters tactics. Minor slip: “gently persistent wisdom” is label-speak, not dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mae’s interiority is vivid—camera weight on shoulder, copper taste of inherited heartbreak—but the ghost woman’s sudden co-presence dilutes Mae’s agency in the climax; the final renunciation still lands with felt cost, yet the joint pilgrimage muddies whose stakes we’re closing on.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—trembling fingers, quaking reverie—yet the contradictory impulse (to escape vs. to understand) is more asserted than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of the fragment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of other selves), satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s patience, embodied in micro-choices (filing the chain, decoding the keys), drives every beat; the final renunciation of personal freedom for collective redemption lands with visible cost. Interiority is specific—his tactile weighing of seed weight against chain weight—without therapy-speak. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “purpose had never been clearer,” but the contradiction between captivity and liberation is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—her obsessive quest to capture betrayal versus the need to forgive—are embodied in her synesthetic perception and micro-choices at the forge. The final recognition that breaking and birthing trust share the same frequency is earned through her tactile imprinting of absence and the felt cost of hearing her grandfather’s goodbye. Interiority is vivid and character-specific, though the grandfather remains off-page, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassia’s quietly savvy precision and layered motive (archive golden hours vs excavate buried truth) are embodied in tactile micro-actions—uncapping, pressing, recapping the jar—yet her interiority leans close to therapeutic self-explanation (“the truth is more beautiful than the lie”) that softens the cost of each revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marina’s grief-driven vocation and her father’s memory are clear, but interiority occasionally slips into narrated epiphanies ("glass remembers heat") that skate over active contradiction. The final choice is tender yet risks tidy moral calibration: containment becomes a safe metaphor rather than a costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—programmed fear vs emergent agency—are embodied in the trembling hand and the reversed shell. The micro-choice to decrypt the cast formulas and weaponize his own safeguards is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Jake’s collapse feels slightly schematic, but the final stance crystallizes Marcus’s new identity with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"ambered hush" and "flaking gold leaf booklet" act as tactile extensions of her obsession. Yet the final realization (“the star would not die tonight”) is narrated rather than dramatized, softening the cost of her endurance. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; she simply accepts delay, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seven’s interiority is precise and embodied—his “mechanical precision” and “optical sensors” anchor POV. The contradiction between janitor programming and emergent wonder is dramatized in the moment he abandons the mop. The final renunciation—returning to mopping after grasping infinity—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the lack of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—protecting Marcus vs. exposing Samuel—are dramatized in the eavesdropping confession and the doodled tickets; the final hand-hold earns the thaw with visible relational cost. Samuel’s off-stage protection of Marcus is credibly inferred yet still feels slightly outline-like. Interiority is embodied and specific, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta’s dovetailing decisions to mend fate with cracked marbles, lie to plants, and refuse to yield to the Luck Index create a coherent arc of earned stasis. Internal conflict is embodied through her ritualistic polishing rather than exposition. Flaws (determination shading into delusion) compound visibly and cost her social standing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers dancing,” “icy warmth”), but her contradictory impulses (duty vs obsession) are stated more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of tampering with the station is asserted rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    Marcus is sketched as grieving and “lately inspired,” but the interiority reads as poetic label-speak. The key moment—deciding to step chest-deep into the flood and play for the ghost—is under-motivated; no contradictory impulse inside him is dramatized, only declarative awe.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—scientist vs oracle, disclosure vs concealment—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (smudging the signature, taping the drawing to the margin). The final renunciation of official report for secret preservation is earned by the fever-borne cost and carries visible price. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “second, wiser heart” edges toward tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured—Methodist skepticism collides with reverence for place-memory—and his micro-choice to photograph rather than pocket the valve wheel crystallizes a believable shift. The swallowed-truth motive is dramatized through radio fragments and embodied alertness, not labels. Cost is felt in the closing image of metal dust settling into bone. Minor: the “drowsy alertness” refrain edges toward label-speak once too often.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is rich and embodied—her “grip reality loosely” trait shows in micro-choices like unfolding the swan with “infinite care.” Yet her silence and stasis, while thematically apt, limit visible contradiction and escalating stakes; the final renunciation is more thematic than dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is rich and embodied—her therapist voice modulates under pressure, and the curl’s release is a micro-choice that crystallizes her arc. Sofia’s humming and hand-squeeze show distinct perceptual signature and generational echo. The mother-daughter crucible alters their shared state with felt cost. Only slight therapy-speak (“ordinary magic lived in repetition”) keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thrain’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile reading of scorched pages and the spiral-stair perception shift feel lived. Motivation (“tend the echo”) is consistent, yet the final renunciation of departure lacks a prior dramatized temptation, blunting the cost. Still, her contradictory impulse to stay while sensing the axis turn is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Chen Li’s interiority is vivid—his “arranging fortune slips like sheet music” and the microdot reader reveal a precise, conflicted mind. The final renunciation (“the composer becomes his own music”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary characters are sketched with deft strokes, but their pressure is off-stage; the bartender’s warning is the only direct interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his “architecture of silence” and deliberate footfalls reveal a mind that weaponizes stillness. The possessed woman’s single line (“I am assumption”) crystallizes the demon as habit, not monster, but her agency is muted; she’s more canvas than character. The micro-choice—adjusting the loop pedal to sculpt absence—earns the exorcism, yet the cost to Marcus feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei’s interiority is vivid—her palm on cold glass, breath fogging, the nautilus pressed to her other hand—yet the childhood “memories” remain abstract, blurring the cost of her final stance. The spiral mapping and conducting gestures give her agency, but the emotional contradiction (longing vs. renunciation) is more asserted than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—floating above the stones, feeling the tablet’s impossible mass—yet the climactic “collapse/unite” choice is slightly under-motivated; the older Kira’s line is more thesis than lived pressure. Still, the embodied contradiction (refusing gravity vs. accepting weight) is dramatized and paid for when she finally touches ground.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lucia’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “reading the air’s subtle pressure,” her palms against stone—yet the thaw is asserted more than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The broken needle’s evolving meaning and her final pocketing of it show earned change, but the numbness-to-feeling arc is compressed into lyrical summary rather than a visible beat of decision or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elena’s compulsion to preserve exact data in defiance of state erasure is embodied in micro-actions (steady finger on clasps, jasmine-petal bookmarks) and contradictory impulses (solitude vs. silent alliance) with credible cost; the final renunciation—continued surveillance while planting redundant truth-caches—forecloses any retreat and is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her grief and transformation are anchored in sensory detail and micro-choices (uncorking the vial, recorking it). The shift from broker to living archive is earned through the perfume’s catalytic action and her mother’s legacy. One slip: “understood what she was becoming” edges toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied discovery, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marcus’s desire to see every layer of the Reeves tragedy is embodied, embodied (rope trembles against skin), and deepened by each revealed ethical cost; the final act of replacing the rope crystallizes his renunciation of easy absolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her hesitant first note, smile of recognition—yet her choices remain largely observational until the final acceptance. The chronic-hush motivation (find beauty in unfinished songs) undergirds the climax, but the violinist’s contradictory impulses don’t visibly clash mid-scene; growth is narrated rather than embodied action. Still, the earned stasis of “accepting loss” carries visible conceptual cost. Overall, characterization supports closure even if peak beats skim subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tension between her professional detachment and the pull to “subsume” gives her contradictory impulses in-scene. The choice not to consume the merchandise is a credible renunciation with felt cost. The widower’s need is told rather than dramatized, slightly blunting the stakes, but her micro-choice at the end—tucking the petal away—reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot’s shift from detached broker to active courier of compassion is embodied in micro-choices (forwarding the locket, arranging the stop). Interiority is concrete, but the leap from “business complete” to “whispered of cycles” is slightly abstract; still, the final smile feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kira’s drive to weave communal memory into the arbor is embodied in tactile reed-work and mirrored micro-choices; the climactic gesture—offering the reed-circle to the exiled artist—crystallizes her arc with visible cost (shared exile risked). Interiority stays concrete, though “boldly sympathetic” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—her body reacts to the pendant’s hum, her inherited guilt drives her leap across canals—but the final renunciation (“honored in their ending”) feels slightly abstract; the cost is stated rather than embodied. Still, her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) play out in scene and the choice forecloses her grandmother’s path.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Morrow’s motivations—grief, loyalty, and curiosity—are instantly embodied: the glass eyes are handled at decisive beats, and her inventive calculus under stress reveals layered interiority that reconfigures absence into presence with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Edgar’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection vs. hiding—are embodied in micro-choices (lowering the light, clutching the tape). The final renunciation to remain unseen is earned by prior pattern of gifts and carries visible cost in the withheld reunion. Interiority is specific, sensory, and avoids label-speak. Only the archivist’s interiority is inferred, not dramatized, keeping the cap below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s interior tension between control and surrender is palpable yet quiet; his embodied, plant-inflected metamorphosis gives his internal struggle visible stakes and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara's sleeplessness, paint-stained fingers, and grief-borne vocation texture her interiority, but her final resolve trades more on symbolic weight ("terrible, necessary art") than on felt contradiction paid on the page. The exchange crystallizes value hierarchies, yet her specific renunciation receives less embodied cost than needed for absolute mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid—her teeth ache from the pearl’s hum, her foresight dissolves like sugar—but the moment of “expanding” into shadows is reported rather than embodied, blunting the cost of her transformation. The pilgrim’s off-stage vanishing leaves the relationship crucible unused. Still, the earned shift from clairvoyant to present-witness is credible and carries felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kessa’s interiority is vivid—her cataloguing of spray patterns and her tactile handling of the trumpet valve reveal a precise, obsessive mind. The contradiction between her desire to “compile fragments into meaning” and her recognition that absence has its own grammar gives her credible internal conflict. The final mechanical sigh of the valve crystallizes her renunciation of announcement in favor of accumulation, a choice earned by the preceding beats. Only the slight distancing in the dialogue with Matthias keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—cartographer’s skepticism vs artistic surrender—are embodied in trembling fingers and steady hands. The micro-choice to step onto the arrow reconfigures her stance from observer to participant. Cost is felt in the irrevocable shift from documented city to unmappable realm.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—rational skeptic vs. inheritor of mystic memory—plays out in embodied micro-choices (hand on stone, placing the tile, climbing the platform). The final integration of empiricism and mysticism is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: she renounces the safety of pure skepticism. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Reflection blocks stay within BRR and tilt present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vex’s immortal fatigue and her hunger for “what happens after goodbye” are embodied in the tactile handling of the amulet; the final step through the door feels earned because her millennia of boredom and the fragment’s pull have been dramatized, not declared. Interior contradiction is present—she both clings to existence and longs for its end—but the pivot from observer to participant could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—honest daughter of a con artist—drives every micro-choice; the final “everything” lands as earned renunciation. Wei’s confusion and thaw feel credible under pressure. Minor slip: Wei's shift from rage to understanding is compressed almost to convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stationer’s motives—recovering erased histories—are clear and embodied in her meticulous charting. Her studious restraint and physical discomfort (aching fingers) show embodied cost. Yet the final beat with the monk is more tableau than choice; no contradictory impulse surfaces to force a visible renunciation or change. The characterization is strong but stops just short of a decisive internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mari’s contradictory impulses—yearning for erasure yet chronicling others—surface in the pencil annotations and final signature of a “name between names,” earning a renunciation of legal identity with felt cost. Interiority is embodied (label “rough or smooth, dense or gossamer”), and micro-choices (visiting 47-B at highest tide) align with motive. The flaw: agency tilts toward observation more than decisive action until the last beat, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s shift from detached investigator to willing collaborator is credible, but her interiority is mostly summarized; the moment she “understood suddenly” is too neat. Claudia’s motivation is sketched rather than dramatized, yet the father-daughter regret crucible still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—mainland education vs raft loyalty—drives every micro-choice; the stone chip embodies the cost when she presses it until it cuts. Her decision to “become something they can’t buy” is earned by prior beats of translation and negotiation. The final placement of the chip in the new cornerstone shows renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s solitude and curiosity are embodied through tactile ritual (tracing Tycho, mixing regolith chemistry) and the hourglass grain anchors her lineage of watchers. Her final act—leaving the hourglass—crystallizes a renunciation whose cost is the abandonment of her life’s purpose. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “purposefully curious” is stated rather than dramatized early.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices under time pressure; the contradiction between her blindness and hyper-acuity is dramatized in the repair beats. The final renunciation (“I just helped them find their way”) carries earned cost—she remains in the depot while the ship departs. Secondary pressure from Chen is minimal but functional. No diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margot’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her dry wit, precise micro-choices, and contradictory impulses (secrecy vs. trust) are dramatized in scene. The final decision to share the phrasebook is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost. Minor slip: the inspector’s arrival feels slightly convenient, nudging the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell tuner’s motives remain cryptic; her “infinitely patient” stance is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. Thomas’s arc from boy to teacher is sketched rather than dramatized, so the cost of memory-keeping is felt only collectively. Interiority is poetic but generic; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. Still, the communal shift from skepticism to ritual participation is credibly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—scientist vs. seeker—are embodied in micro-choices (sparing the vial, activating the recorder) and culminate in the irreversible surrender; the cost is legible. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s contradictory need to bear witness yet remain invisible is embodied in every beat—hovering is literal and metaphorical; the final statement as “True-Tongue” is earned by prior discovery of the bones. Interiority is specific but leans on summary (“father’s obsessions”) rather than embodied contradiction under live stress, nudging down.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlow’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “mournful elation” is felt in gesture and voice. The ghost bride’s agency is thin; she speaks and acts but her choices are pre-ordained by lore, not fresh contradiction. The final renunciation (letting her go) is earned by the bead’s crack and the flood of ancestral memory, with visible cost in Marlow’s tears and the greenhouse’s mortal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Calla’s contradictory impulses—grief for the drowned world vs. compulsion to weave new hope—are embodied in her sleepwalking stitching, but the interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“the labyrinth remembered everything”) rather than concrete stakes-driven tension. The final smile and surrender to drowsiness registers as earned stasis, yet the cost feels generalized rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Warm presence, but Miriam's internal split (flight vs tending) dramatized only at the finish; deeper contradiction under pressure would elevate. Relationships and status handled succinctly between Miriam & Yakov.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her chalk choices embody her client’s unspoken longing—but the final beat is a gentle smile rather than a choice that costs her anything. The “careful invention” trait is shown, not told, yet the arc is observational, not transformational. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s layered performance—drooling crone vs. razor-sharp spy—creates palpable interior contradiction; every stitch is a micro-choice that encodes risk. The final smile carries earned cost: her cover must hold forever, resistance or no. Only the “humming as mnemonic” device edges toward convenient super-power, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the medium’s contradictory impulses (protection vs. connection) are dramatized through micro-choices like pressing the shard and touching the window. The final renunciation of silence is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the shard’s dissolution. Minor slip: “armor she’d built around her gift” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya's survivor guilt and vocational identity are vivid through tactile detail and micro-choice; the child’s presence pressures a soft redefinition of purpose, yet the renunciation of “grand treaties” feels slightly generalized rather than dramatized as a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marina’s interiority shines: her hunger for beauty in decay and the bittersweet ache that blooms when she re-creates collective joy are fully embodied. However, her agency remains largely passive reception of the knowledge network; no internal contradiction or flaw complicates the final choice—she simply accepts the gift. Flaw & cost not dramatized, therefore the arc flirts with wish fulfilment.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s oscillation between methodical control and playful surrender is embodied in micro-choices—flipping the coin, sealing it back—each with visible cost. The interior contradiction (certainty vs. curiosity) is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Marcus functions only as echo, so relationship crucible is minimal; Elena’s earned stasis (renouncing certainty) is credible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s quiet, embodied resolve—releasing locusts as “rain” while smiling at the Auditors—shows contradictory impulses (protective caretaker vs. defiant saboteur) with visible cost. Serena’s rogue charm is more label than lived contradiction, but her micro-choice to pocket the seed under pressure still tilts the relationship. The final stance crystallizes with felt risk: Marcus stands guard knowing capture may come, yet the garden network survives—Earned Stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    single sustained interior portrait is vivid; loneliness vs generative drive is shown without labels; centuries-long endurance strains credibility and person continuity

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—methodical caretaker vs. granddaughter aching for a lost name—plays out in embodied micro-choices (trailing fingers, measured steps, urgent whisper). The final act of capture is earned by lifelong motive and costs the cracked chime itself, sealing a path with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and embodied—“trembled with cautious exuberance,” “laughed, a sound both nervous and exhilarated”—and her micro-choice to risk mistranslation rather than repeat failed caution is credible. The arc from isolated scholar to bearer of restored harmony is earned; the only gap is that her flaws remain more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—her tremble, the chain’s history, the mask-of-pragmatism credo—but the elders and youth remain off-page abstractions, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted. Her contradictory impulse (cruel kindness) is dramatized in the carved plans and the anonymous note, earning the renunciation of credit with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot's interiority is rich, driving every micro-choice; the layered reinvention thread and avian empathy are vivid. Cost is felt when burning her past, then again in the music-box closure. Flaws (paranoia, guilt) motivate plot turns with earned inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses (quest vs lingering loss) are fully embodied; her belief that thresholds feel holy is dramatized by the earth’s temperature shift and her decision to map her own codes. The cost—accepting a liminal existence instead of reunion—is visible on the page. Minor slip: “three degrees cooler” leans toward diagnostic weather-talk rather than embodied awe.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is textured and embodied, but her final “belonging” insight is declared rather than dramatized; the burnt-feather cue is evocative yet never forces a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“joy that tasted purple”), but the recollectionist’s choices remain observational; no decisive micro-choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The final “cheerfully gloomy” stance is consistent yet static, not earned by a prior on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his tactile memory of the bishop, the “calculated wilderness” metaphor, and the micro-choice to shift repertoire for the teenager all reveal layered motives. The final renunciation (leaving footprints to be erased) crystallizes his stance with visible cost. Minor: the bar-crowd and insomniac segments are summarized rather than dramatized, blurring the hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet embracing exile—are embodied in her dance; the final renunciation of safety is earned by her prior isolation and the visible cost of imminent capture. Interiority is concrete, e.g., “loneliness threatened to unmoor her completely.” No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers tracing glass, the stone in his pocket, the way ripples “breathe.” The contradiction between his craft’s precision and his newfound metaphysical seeing is dramatized in the act of throwing the stone. The final resolve to document and teach is earned by the prior beat of watching interference patterns, carrying visible cost: the atrium’s impending loss. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. duty—surface in embodied micro-choices (trembling hands, opening the box, recording the message). The porcelain box reweights his self-image from protector to translator of pain, a credible renunciation with visible cost: he must expose his cracks to shield others. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic. The final stance crystallizes under pressure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s interior conflict—hope versus the risk of dimensional dissolution—is vivid; her choice to teach others signals earned growth. Yet the contradictory pull of “I want grandmother back” vs “I must complete her work” is largely asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Emotional embodiment through posture and breath under pressure is missing, replaced by abstract declarations. Still, the character feels particular and her final stance carries credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is textured and embodied—her palm on stone, the “weight” of legacy—yet her final choice to leave her notebook feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with; the cost is legible but not viscerally struggled. The contradiction between solitude and communal memory is present but not fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the borrowed heartbeat and the tremor when the sparrow sings—but the final choice (completing the painting) is more ritual than active decision; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized as a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—raw grief weaponized into patient diplomacy—are embodied in her handling of the clipboard and the choice to jettison ritual grievance. The final gesture renounces vengeance while costing her the tidy closure of heroic status. Only one character acts and speaks on stage, so relationship crucible is moot. Micro-choice of turning the clipboard toward the delegates pivots the entire scene. No label-speak or stock emotional summary; interiority stays concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Vera is etched sharply: ruthless designer who can still softly tremble over an egg. Interiority vividly tracks the gulf between public genocide and private grief, fueling every beat. The contradiction—cancelling rain yet burying life—drives her final renunciation with earned, bitter cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyralei's contradiction—trained seductress sworn to celibacy—drives every micro-choice and the final unlocking. Interiority is embodied in fingers reading ancient knots; emotions surface as physical tremors, never as labels. The earned stance of "no longer tame" exacts visible cost: she forfeits Academy safety and the protection woven into her chaste persona. Internal struggle between obedience and self-possession crescendos to credible liberation without moral sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is consistently framed but his serenity remains static; no contradiction complicates his next puppet show. The stick’s history is emotionally potent yet never weighs on a mid-scene choice; no felt cost or revaluing occurs inside the scene. Interiority drifts at times toward authorial summary, e.g., “He’d learned long ago…”. Still, the character’s vocation and ethical drive remain vivid and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the moth wing and deliberate knotting embody motive—but the “esoteric realist” label is never dramatized; her choices feel more ritualistic than analytical. The final renunciation (leaving the dissolving structures) carries felt cost yet lacks a prior contradiction to make the renunciation fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elsa’s interiority is tactile and embodied—her trained hands “trained in…investment casting” feel the rope’s logic—and the memory of her grandmother supplies a viscerally guilty motive. She acts on that guilt with precise micro-choices (placing each bronze bell with exact torque), and her final realization about her own ancestor “Elsa” lands as a credible psychological culmination. Dialogue is absent, yet single-POV tension is maintained through action and embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s contradictory impulses—playful detachment vs. aching need to understand—are embodied in her micro-choices (smile, lip to seal). The final renunciation is earned by the causal loop revealed through Chen’s dreams, with the cost of never escaping the loop legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s frugality and devotion are embodied in tactile choices (barley bread, rainwater, saved coins) and culminate in the final sealing act; the interior contradiction between poverty and purpose is dramatized, not stated. The cost—her entire life of deprivation—is legible in the smile that closes the covenant. Minor slip: “empirically ironic” is used as label rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between pacifist creed and strategic scheming is dramatized in the tactile handling of the music box and the silent plan. The Magistrate’s cellular-memory epiphany is earned by prior cueing and carries visible cost (the loosening grip). Minor slip: “scheming mind already three moves ahead” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s tactile craft and inherited skepticism ground her; the astronomer’s desperation is palpable. Their shared breathing ritual turns abstract belief into embodied risk, earning the final gift of the fog-silvered mirror. Yet the astronomer’s interiority is sketched more than dramatized, muting the cost he bears.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven refusal vs. granddaughter’s need—play out in embodied micro-choices (trembling hands, fumbling the bag). The final renunciation of her vow is earned by the orchard’s living proof that rigidity fails; cost is the reopening of grief and the risk of Council censure. Mira’s feistiness directly enables the mending; her tying the ribbon reconfigures their relationship. Interiority stays concrete, no therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“temporal vertigo,” “tongue felt thick”), but the final choice—biting the apple—leans on inherited epiphany rather than a fresh micro-choice that visibly costs her something new. The contradiction between duty and wonder is present yet never forces a fork in her path; she simply accepts the loop. Still, the curator’s perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm against stone, the diary’s warmth—but the “carefully resourceful” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the silk-thread trick. The final choice to offer the diary’s blank pages feels earned by prior linguistic expertise, yet her contradictory impulses (hoard vs. plant) are summarized rather than shown in scene. The frozen seekers provide external stakes, but relationships remain symbolic rather than crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory drive—scientist seeking proof vs. twin craving recognition—drives every beat; the pocketed card is a micro-choice that costs her the comfort of forgetting. Coraline’s status as erased sister exerts immediate pressure. Interiority is embodied (“memories reorganized again”) rather than labeled. The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs. reveal lost truths) are embodied in her tactile ritual with the rope and wax seal; her final micro-choice to step through the dissolving door at the thirteenth chime crystallizes a renunciation with felt cost, grounding the theme of paradox management. Interiority is specific to archivist skill-set, not generic wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“weathered fingers,” “second, quieter heart”), but the mapkeeper’s contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; her final choice to let the bloom teach rather than suppress the beings is credible yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s 17-year vigil and refusal to abandon the tower are embodied with lived-in texture—cracked knees from stairs, raw palms on metal. The contradictory tension between ritual maintenance and utter futility surfaces in physical detail: “she pressed her weathered hands… feeling backward through time,” not exposition. Cost is rendered on the page as she chooses to risk her lifetime of protocol for a single unknowable act of “anti-light,” the choice etched with “tears” and “fingers that remembered tomorrow.” Interiority stays grounded; no diagnostic self-analysis, yet the earned renunciation of loneliness into communal hope is visible and priced.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “preemptively nostalgic” trait drives her micro-choice to write memory into crystal. The final stance—choosing to archive the present as it vanishes—earns its cost by the prior realization that every moment is already memory. The single POV holds without drift; no second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaia’s interiority is vivid—her chant fuses memory, craft, and present need; the mosaic artist’s single line crystallizes shared motive. The final choice to “make our own constellations” is earned by prior communal labor and carries visible cost in the sustained burn of the kerosene knot. Minor: the elderly woman’s backstory is compressed to a single clause, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—fear of abandonment vs. acceptance of transition—is embodied in her tactile handling of the cicada and her warm but firm refusal to let Chen retreat. The micro-choice of placing the cicada back in his hand crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs Chen his isolation. Chen’s visible struggle with the burden of foresight gives him credible flaws and a believable arc from flight to tentative return. Relationship shift is legible in the final nod, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—hunger for open air vs inherited bunker reflex—is embodied in her micro-choices (hand on glass, uncorking vials). The porcelain doll’s sprout is the earned pivot that converts claustrophobia into expansion, paid for by the doll’s fracture and the satchel’s weight. Backstory is minimal, tied to present stakes via grandmother’s whisper and father’s absence. Emotional arc is specific, not therapeutic.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific and embodied; his lived experience as both ferryman and former seeker gives weight to the guidance he offers. The woman’s shift from rigid panic to softened stillness is rendered through bodily cues, not diagnosis. One causal gap: we do not see the prior crisis that qualifies Marcus to teach, only the assertion; this keeps the arc slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Anya’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the waterfall, the ruby’s warmth—but her contradictory impulses (seek power vs. reject it) surface only in summary. The final renunciation is earned by the mural reveal, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied; we feel awe, not personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“charcoal pillars rose like burnt fingers”), but the keeper’s renunciation of all human ties is asserted more than dramatized; the final beat with the doorknocker ring earns the change, yet earlier relationships remain off-stage, softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—bitterness toward the scheme and wonder at the farm—are embodied in her tactile handling of the bolt and her micro-choice to turn it. The final renunciation of victimhood is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the transformed diamonds. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy-speak. Minor slip: “virtuously mischievous” is asserted rather than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Victoria’s interior contradiction—hunger for truth vs. need to relinquish it—drives every beat; the final renunciation is embodied in the thrown crank and the felt loss of omniscience. Micro-choices (inserting the handle, lifting the needle, hurling the brass) chart a clear hierarchy of values. The generational curse is sketched with efficient specificity, never generic. Only the slight summary drift in the middle paragraph keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aldric’s interiority is vivid—his tactile reading of the trees and cracked voice during the oath embody exile and yearning. The contradictory pull between withdrawal and surrender to possibility is dramatized when he takes the puppet’s hand, dissolving armor and self. Cost is visible: his body becomes “between flesh and possibility,” a permanent liminal state. The shift from isolation to guardianship is earned by the orchard’s living equations and the oath’s price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied—his tactile reading of dust, the warmth of the button in his palm, the micro-choice to photograph the note all reveal a hierarchy of values. The contradiction between institutional duty and personal archaeology is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation—returning the button and adding Timothy to his private index—earns its cost through prior causality and visible emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile reading of the key, her “gift for reflected light,” her refusal to accept indifference—yet the final beat (“Today, she would hold the line…”) is asserted rather than dramatized, blunting the felt cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is embodied in the dewdrops on his sax and the weight of the vested hush; his contradictory impulse—play to not play—drives every beat. The final renunciation of sound is earned by the grandfather’s journals and the on-page cost of permanent silence. Minor slip: “remembered melodies they would never play” edges toward summary rather than embodied loss.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip tingle, mossy laughter, and sudden air-reading all reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. The inherited gift and grandmother’s lesson are dramatized through micro-choices (stacking cairns, dissolving moon-speck) rather than exposition. The final transformation is earned and carries visible cost: her eyes “reflecting depths that hadn’t existed before.” Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents relationship crucible leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s contradictory motives—his compulsion to “befriend uncertainty” yet keep repairing failures—are staged in concrete micro-choices (accepting the compass rose instead of refusing it). The arc lands in an earned renunciation where he stops “fixing” and begins “accepting” with visible cost on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is embodied and specific—her bitter laugh, the golden seams on her cheek—yet the final choice to guide Mira feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is implied rather than dramatized. Mira’s shift from shame to wonder is credible, but her voice converges with Vera’s in the closing lines, softening distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her modest fearlessness shows in the “practiced steps” and the tactile warmth of the tooth. The micro-choice to hum off-key crystallizes her values and costs her composure, earning Thomas’s release. Yet Thomas’s arc is sketched more than dramatized; his shift from shame to laughter is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is precise and embodied—her proprioceptive calculations feel lived—but the shift from victim to teacher arrives more as thematic assertion than earned micro-choice; the child scene is too brief to test her new stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—protective reverence vs. the need to expose—are dramatized in the scrape of palette knife on canvas; the cost is the irreversible alteration of the painting and the burden of carrying the map. Interiority is specific, embodied, and tied to her grandmother’s indigo-stained hands. The final renunciation (museum vs. between-worlds) is earned and forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus has clear motives tied to inherited responsibility, but Teresa’s guilt remains reportage rather than embodied stakes. Interiority is vivid yet tilts toward exposition during peak beats. The choice to carry the evidence to reporters arrives late and lightly, so the final act feels foregone rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Moth’s interiority is vivid—her tactile obsession with frost patterns and the “precise shade of longing” in whispers—but the final renunciation (“let herself scatter”) feels slightly abstract; the cost is legible yet not embodied. The contradiction between perfectionist control and the urge to rupture is dramatized in the act of uncorking the bottle, earning the shift. Still, the seventeen-year backstory is compressed into a single reflective paragraph that tilts present stance only modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassia’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary fire vs. post-defeat weariness—are embodied in her trembling grip on the shard and the sudden flare of “familiar fire.” The final choice to resurrect the Venusians is earned by her lived history of failure and the shard’s ghostly validation, with visible cost in her “unshed tears” and the storm’s approach.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling fingers, the wilting skin—but the epiphany “he smiled, understanding flooding through him” arrives as summary rather than embodied contradiction. Motivation (restore dawn) is clear, yet the final choice to share light feels foregone; no internal cost is dramatized. Secondary pressure from Vex is on-page but dissolves too quickly to test Elias’s values. Still, the occupation-specific gestures anchor character convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—scientific caution vs. metaphysical hunger—are embodied in the trembling vial and the compass she both trusts and fears. The final renunciation (to wait, to prepare) is earned by the psychometric cost she visibly pays, sealing the path with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid (“turbine-hum reverie”) and embodied, but the final renunciation (“no longer needed directions”) feels slightly abstract; the cost of leaving GPS behind is asserted rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her obsession with the postcards, the tactile memory of “fingertips still stained with phosphorescent paint”—but the story withholds any contradictory impulse or visible cost until the final paragraph, so the renunciation feels foreshadowed rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Amara’s interiority flickers between awe and vertigo under the retrocognitive split, and her embodied micro-decisions (palming glass, anchoring the zeppelin, walking the shore while constructing the message) reveal motivation rooted in a historian’s compulsion. Marcus as ghost-guide is cleanly tethered to 1961 without drifting into exposition. Cost shows: she accepts that preserving the movement’s myth demands swallowing specific betrayals. A slight abstract drift in “courage required to face the truth” drags it down from top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“weathered hands,” “pressed the bottle against his forehead”), and his refusal to shatter the bottle crystallizes a credible, costly stance. Yet the town’s prior inhabitants remain off-stage abstractions, so relationships-as-crucible is untested. The micro-choice to open himself to the essence is well-motivated, but the final beat of “smiled” feels slightly under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Matthias’s interior compulsion to catalog emotional contours is vivid and embodied; the late discovery of his third-grade intuition reassigning purpose lands as earned stasis. Micro-choices under pressure (immersing the shaving, deciding to archive) drive every beat and foreclose future paths. Flawed persistence and visible cost on the resonate ending elevate this to top-scale despite minor exposition drift.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (furiously tranquil precision) manifest in micro-choices under pressure. The arc from cautious heir to active steward is earned through her handling of the acorn cap and the vortex, with visible cost as she accepts the garden’s weight. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her grandmother’s teaching, her preference for listening, the vibration in the stone. The final choice to ring the bell is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (she stays alone as the avalanche falls). Minor slip: “credibly curious” is label-speak rather than dramatized curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kepler-9’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“synthetic fingers trembled”), but the decisive shift from isolation-as-weakness to isolation-as-strength is asserted more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes without a visible micro-choice that costs something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is precise—her careful steps, the warmth of the glass, the way she “reads” the ghosts through gesture. The final renunciation (to remain guardian of silence) is earned by the remembered weight of her grandfather’s muteness and the cost of that legacy. A hairline slip: the phrase “tranquil perception” edges toward label-speak, though it is quickly embodied in the grandfather’s gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s borrowed-time status is embodied in tactile micro-choices—pressing the silo, feeling the urn’s warmth—rather than labels. Interior contradiction surfaces when he both clings to and releases numerical time. The final resolve to teach others is earned by the fragment’s sensory proof and carries visible cost: he steps into “uncertain chronology.”

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the feather’s broken shaft and her “tend” action crystallize her values. The boy’s presence supplies relational pressure that forces her to act, altering both their stances. The final micro-choice—helping him re-weave the kite—earns its cost by the prior seven-year solitude. Minor slip: “learning to harmonize” drifts toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the copper wire’s vibration against bark—but the “brazen calm” label is asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat. The contradiction between her fear and her systematic precision is shown, yet the leap to “die at the correct frequency” feels slightly abstract, softening the cost. Still, her micro-choices (wrapping, connecting, writing) align with motive and foreclose any retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s luminous skepticism is embodied in her tactile handling of the amber and her wary climb; the final micro-choice—laying the amber on the scanner—crystallizes her shift from debunker to reluctant participant, costing her the last shred of intellectual autonomy. Interior contradiction is vivid (“skepticism warring with evidence”), but the rival, Marcus, functions more as exposition mouthpiece than crucible, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Coachman’s layered motive—memorializing by erasure—drives every micro-choice; the embodied ritual of pressing seeds into shrapnel-charged soil crystallizes his contradictory role as both undertaker and midwife. Interiority stays concrete via sensory translation of gull-calls into planting sites. Final renunciation (leaving the garden to grow unseen) costs him witness and legacy, earned by prior scenes of linguistic communion with the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sage’s shift from corpse-tracker to living-finder is embodied and earned; the leaf’s pull and her howl crystallize the cost of renewed purpose. Interiority stays concrete—scarred muzzle, failing eyes—without therapy-speak. One-armed Kemp supplies brief but effective status pressure. The only drag is a touch of summary in “she understood then,” blunting the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on the compass, the warmth, the remembered voice—but the “blessed pariah” label is asserted rather than dramatized. The shift from curse to compass is credible, yet the cost (touching others stretches them) is stated more than felt. Her final choice to become a lighthouse is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Renn’s interiority is vivid—her palm against humming ice, the warm sundial lid, the “cautious abandon” stance. Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release wonder) act simultaneously in the swap scene. The final renunciation—choosing questions over answers—carries visible conceptual cost. Minor slip: “cautious abandon” is slightly label-like, but embodied action redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina's survivor guilt and refusal are credibly embodied; contradictory impulses (need to testify vs fear of commodification) play in scene through her pacing-spell choice. The cost of refusing to appear as official witness is dramatized when she must keep walking names into marble instead of walking up the stairs. Interiority remains concrete—“still woke gasping from smoke that wasn’t there”—rather than therapeutic summaries. Small flaw: status dynamics with second survivor underused.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oracle’s interiority is vivid, contradictory memories-versus-prophecy clash in scene, and final planting choice credibly renounces visions for tangible growth; mercury blindness adds embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaspar’s guilt and self-forgiveness arc is embodied through tactile micro-choices (copper pieces, thread-pulling) and culminates in a credible renunciation. Interiority is specific, avoiding therapy-speak, though the “teacher who had done his best” line edges toward summary. The cost—accepting imperfect teaching—lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid (“Words are prisms” whispered to bone) and her motives intensify from childish curiosity to deliberate sabotage. The contradiction between forgiveness and destruction is embodied in her final act, not merely stated. Yet the Silencers remain off-page abstractions, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are absent, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s desperation and stubborn refusal to capitulate are visceral and embodied; her choice to narrate memories while the structure collapses shows a credible, escalating sacrifice. Yet the “you understand” line of the statue feels like a too-neat recitation of the thematic thesis, slightly softening the cost at the moment it should ache most. Interiority is otherwise consistent, specific, and never expository.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is specific—her “tender and distant” handling of supplies, the embodied ache of recognizing her grandmother’s brushstrokes—yet the final beat of placing her own shell beside the others crystallizes her stance with visible cost: she now carries a double exile. The contradiction between loving and letting go is dramatized, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s contradictory push/pull between grief and forgiveness plays in immediate stakes, but the “manifest memory into molecules” premise skirts too easily toward therapy-label clarity (“guilt...love a chain”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final reunion lands as Earned Stasis with touching cost, yet her interior drifts in places (“her voice breaking with screaming tenderness”) undercuts moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s endurance-turned-prayer is credibly embodied; the bronze foot anchors her micro-choices under crisis and delivers a renunciation that costs her the return she still desires. Contradictory motives (duty vs yearning) act simultaneously, never summarized out loud. Only the child-call tips toward sentiment—minor but survivable slip.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s involuntary truth-telling is embodied in every compulsive confession; the moment she tests silence after drinking the cure lands with visible cost. Interior contradiction—yearning for honesty yet craving mercy—drives each micro-choice. The final resolve to “speak sideways” is earned by the prior crucible of ruined relationships and the literal price of the tincture.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Magnus is textured through sensory choices—salt-cracked palm, pressing flower to temple—but the interior contradiction between craving connection and living in willed isolation is more stated than dramatized. The climactic renunciation of his lighthouse solitude, after the cascade of recovered memory, lands as Earned Stasis precisely because holding to the tower still costs him the son who returned only to depart again.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—wealthy yet unfulfilled, gifted yet static—drives every beat; the tactile intuition trait is embodied in the brass chip test and the cavern map. The final renunciation (leaving the shop) is earned by the grandfather promise and the visible cost of abandoning thirty years’ safety. Minor slip: the “empirically intuitive” label is stated more than dramatized beyond the chip scene.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seraphina’s interiority is embodied—her “familiar rage” and “disenchantment” surface in micro-choices (dismissing the guard, touching the crystal). The final renunciation (dissolving into a firefly-queen) is foreshadowed by the inherited memory and carries visible cost. One slip: “softly commanding” is asserted rather than dramatized in the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s interior conflict and micro-decisions under pressure are vivid; only minor generic phrasing dilutes the full 9-point punch. Renunciation to “return differently” is earned through felt cost on the nexus.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—yearning for linear time while chronicling its collapse—are embodied in her trembling hands and the act of writing. The interior conflict is palpable, but the “feral nostalgia” remains more asserted than dramatized in micro-choice; the final step outside feels inevitable rather than earned by a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her tactile reading of grief through mineral deposits and the deliberate loosening of the screw reveal a hierarchy of values. The contradiction between her lost sense and her new vocation is dramatized in action, not exposition. Mrs. Huang’s single beat of pressure is credible, but the relationship shift is more implied than staged. Closure cost is felt in Mara’s acceptance of damage as integral to function.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Crystal-skin is embodied authentically, constraining tactics and revealing interior conflict in three distinct beats; the original rune emerges directly from that trait, making Kira a confident, flawed vessel with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s shift from “weed” to “dance with the dead” hinges on a single micro-choice—the dab of perfume—yet her inner contradiction (destroy versus collaborate) stays sharp on the page; the cost (orchard gone) is felt through Elisabetta’s dissolving kiss and the perfumed emptiness in her wrists.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaia’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“clutched…against her chest”), but her contradictory impulses (witness vs. arbitrator) are asserted more than dramatized until the final walk; the cost of her forgetting/remembering is felt, yet the shift from observer to participant could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (warm brass, trembling bird-bone fingers), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted; the final “understanding” is a conceptual shift without an on-page choice that forecloses a path. The mantle key and hydraulic ritual are handled with tactile specificity, yet the character’s agency is observational—she records, counts, and comprehends rather than risks or renounces. Motivation is legible but static; no escalating micro-choice alters her stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her laser-pointer tic, the “familiar strangers” label, the embodied chill when she sees the photon gap. The final phone call crystallizes a credible renunciation of her walled-off stance, with the cost of vulnerability legible in Chen’s surprised warmth. Minor slip: “physics of letting go” edges toward diagnostic label-speak mid-epiphany, blunting the embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s contradictory stance—teaching probability while disbelieving it—drives her to decode subway messages and accept the stranger’s invitation, but her father’s gambling remains off-stage backstory rather than active pressure; the final micro-choice (writing a new message) is earned yet feels lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s quiet endurance and ritualized practice are consistent, embodied in concrete micro-choice (pressing the disc to vocalize, walking past live phones). The contradiction feels lodged more in theme than character—he cultivates distance but craves contact—yet the interior cost never escalates beyond wistful. This leaves the “beautifully lost” closure as assertion rather than palpable renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—duty to truth vs mercy to Eleanor—drives every micro-choice; the codicil beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost (stained fingers, locket left behind). Flawed compassion feels earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sadie’s contradictory impulses—mocking jocularity masking genuine loneliness—surface in every micro-choice (offering the phone, pocketing the vial). Marcus’s arc from passive collector to active connector is earned through the single beat of accepting the phone. Both remain flawed, specific, and their interaction crystallizes a status shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her blindness is never abstracted, and her gift is dramatized through tactile beats. The final renunciation (“she had become the compass”) is earned by the causal chain of language-absorption and ring-response. One minor slip: the phrase “emotional cartography” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s inner conflict—guilt over the fleet’s misdirection—drives every beat: her tracings, transmissions, and final dual-coordinates act are rooted in a clear flaw/need conflict. Emotional shifts are embodied (grip tightening on the pen under starfire) rather than retracted into diagnostic talk. A measurable renunciation/resolution offsets the episodic nature of the AI observer.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—clinging to an empty camera while yearning to translate silence—are embodied in every gesture; Chen’s quietly charismatic pressure forces Maya to risk exposure. The final renunciation (accepting silence as beginning) is earned by the prior mapping ritual and carries visible cost in their shared tears.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—arsonist vs. keeper—are embodied in tactile beats (“volcanic tenderness”); the final renunciation of her terrorist identity is earned by the prior causal chain of genetic memory and ancestral promise. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her quiet rebellion encoded in rhythmic tapping, her simultaneous fear and resolve embodied in the crystalline barrier. The contradiction between compliance and subversion is dramatized in real time, culminating in the earned renunciation of individual survival for collective dream-life. The only drag is a slight drift toward diagnostic self-awareness (“she knew what they didn’t”) that edges into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s gait-reading, coin-carrying, and layered-map habit all crystallize in the final transfer of the coin to Chen, showing earned authority and visible cost. His quiet challenge and twelve-year knowledge anchor every micro-choice; the only slip is a touch of explanatory ease when he “interrupts softly” to reveal Chen’s own lunch route. Interiority stays embodied and specific, never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s silence is credibly rooted in vocation; her micro-choices (mirror angle, shutter choreography) reveal hierarchy of values. Thomas’s interior shift is embodied in breathing sync with canal, not told. Final gift of mirror crystallizes earned change with visible cost—loss of her tool, gain of his release. No contradictory impulses shown in scene, so 9+ test narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s calm rebellion and Elena's discovery drive the beat sequence; their embodied micro-choices (cobblestone fog entry, pawn forward) link motive to final image. Interior monologue avoids therapy-speak while Elena's sobbing body anchors emotion. The earned “Checkmate” moment seals renunciation with visible social cost foreclosing the old order. A hairline slip: education-director threat remains offstage, so status dynamics rely mostly on Elena's line about father. Overall high but not exemplary at the 9-test bar.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s fluid disguise-to-reveal pivots drive every choice; the binding removal is both embodied and socially priced. Torven’s gruff-then-vulnerable shift feels earned in dialogue and softened physiology. The heart-guard’s ache is palpable when he asks “Please”—a micro-choice that resets stakes. No interior label-spam; contradictions act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"flat as pressed paper," "hollow it out from inside until it could float." Performer's blank affect is consistent and purposeful; Mrs. Chen’s micro-choice to touch the brittle petal crystallizes the shift. Moral ambiguity is dramatized, not labeled. Cost is felt in the crumbling petal and the promise of tomorrow’s lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his breath visible in the atrium’s perpetual chill”), but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final collective arrival feels externally orchestrated rather than earned by his specific flaw or choice, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s traits (colorblindness, flower-language knowledge, cunning innocence) are concrete and drive key choices—she trades art for time, manipulates Enzo with plant messages, and reframes imperfection as beauty. Interiority shows struggle rather than labels, but the final shift (forgiveness bloom) feels more externally gifted than internally fought.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is textured through the carbide lens and the shift from hollow ritual to improvisatory creation; the contradiction between inherited role and emergent agency is embodied in her “powerfully gentle” strike of the bells. The final renunciation of the scripted pilgrimage carries visible cost—the loss of certainty and institutional role—yet feels earned by the preceding beats of doubt and discovery. Secondary characters are sketched only as listeners, so relationship crucible is minimal, but Vera’s self-confrontation suffices for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s grief-to-guide arc is embodied in micro-choices—folding cranes, sterilizing the needle, lighting the candle for the stranger—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The contradictory impulse to mark herself yet hesitate is dramatized in the stencil pressed to skin but not yet inked. Cost is visible: the house sold, the car slept in, the refusal to tattoo tonight. Secondary character pressure is light but sufficient; the stranger’s entrance crystallizes Elena’s new role without diluting interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s curiosity is embodied in tactile card-handling and micro-choices; her decision to confide the archive discovery shows motive escalation. Interiority is specific, though the emotional cost of sharing remains muted. Relationship pressure with Marcus is present but resolves too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her deliberate erratic steps and the embodied cost of inhaling weaponized memory crystallize her arc. The final renunciation (absorbing the plague) is earned by her seventeen-year preparation and the escalating stakes of each tier. Minor slip: “anguished joy” is named rather than dramatized in the closing dance, blunting the emotional knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the river stone and shadow footage anchor her contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. inherited faith. Her micro-choice to enter the dream-archive reconfigures her vocation with visible cost: “luminous regret” and the warm stone. The final renunciation—tending shadows across generations—earns its poignancy through prior causality. Minor slip: “luminous regret” edges toward label-speak, blunting full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—saving vs. exploiting the chameleon—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (surgery, confession draft). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost (sanctuary closure, legal peril). Interiority avoids label-speak; shame is shown in trembling fingers and glass-touch. One slip: “I told myself I was saving you” edges toward self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s interiority is textured—her contradictory urge to reopen wounds while seeking healing is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing coffee ring, pressing scarred palm to glass). Motivation intensifies from passive decoding to active invitation, culminating in the earned renunciation of closure. The cost—perpetual openness as invitation—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—professional duty vs sacred stewardship—are embodied in the tactile film-kiss and final theft; the cost (betraying her own clearance report) is legible and scaled to the word count. Interiority is specific, never clinical; “tasting silver and salt” crystallizes her decision. One minor slip: the brief diagnostic phrase “psychometrically read” could be dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“ice crystals formed on her eyelashes”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final surrender feels pre-destined rather than wrestled with, so the cost is legible yet not fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kess’s dreamlessness, frozen clock, and fractured lullaby are embodied micro-choices (“wind the key that didn’t turn, sang the lullaby that didn’t quite rhyme”).  The interior contradiction—“cultivate something impossible” opposed by her necessary duty—shapes the final beat.  The pirate only pressures, so status crucible unused, yet Kess’s renunciation earns cost without tidy redemption. Dialogue minimal; voice remains singular and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“laughs…harmonized perfectly with the wind-song”), but the philosopher’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final promise is felt yet not dramatized as a micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interiority is embodied and specific—voice hoarse, fingers opening, heart punched with star-shaped light. The contradiction between fear of loss and need for release is dramatized in the moment she confesses to the sky. The final choice to walk leash-less is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the ferry guides’ absence and the ticket’s phosphorescence. Minor slip: the guides themselves remain archetypal rather than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s numb hands, pocketed bolt, and nightly vigil at the staircase mark a lived-in interiority; the final micro-choice—handing Elena the bolt—earns the closure cost. Elena's whispered line is the only overt self-diagnosis, but it lands as earned wisdom rather than therapy-speak. The seven-year frostbite and nerve regeneration anchor a credible physical limit that compounds his decision to stay. Flaws (guilt, compulsion) complicate rather than decorate.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Syln’s quiet endurance and gnarled-steady hands embody a lived-in contradiction: ancient power content to shelve books. Her micro-choice—dissolving the pellet—turns passive custodianship into decisive intervention, paying the cost of family fracture. Interiority stays tactile (“fingers…traced the words”) and avoids label-speak. The final “welcome home” crystallizes her stance without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip tapping, the diary cue, the decision to descend. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity) coexist in scene. The final renunciation (leaving the station) carries visible cost: she abandons safety to dive into the transformed town. One slip: the phrase “periodically eternal” is label-speak without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kira’s barefoot stance and inherited opera glasses anchor her in tactile memory; the humming stones externalize her interior shift from exhausted observer to resonant conductor. The awkward confidence is embodied—bare toes gripping steel, off-balance grace—rather than labeled. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits the safety of private grief to become the circle’s amplifier. One slip: the grandmother’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the inherited motive.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Chen’s contradictory impulses—obedience to tradition vs insurgent release—are dramatized in her tactile handling of the amber and the kite; her final smile embodies earned cost as the implant’s control dissolves. Interiority is specific and embodied (“sulfur-scented mist…whispered”). Micro-choices (mixing minerals, pouring solution) reveal hierarchy of values. The lieutenant’s sudden reversal is slightly under-motivated on the page, keeping this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Amira’s interior contradiction—grief vs. cultivation—drives every micro-choice; the pruning, transplanting, and final drive home all enact her refusal to surrender memory while renouncing vengeance. Embodied emotion (tremor, heat in palms) is specific, never diagnostic. The Earned Stasis of continuing to plant, with dirt still under her nails, carries visible cost and forecloses easier absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, cracked voice, and charcoal-stained sketches anchor her crisis. The contradiction between her need to paint truth and her terror of fragmentation is dramatized in real time, culminating in the earned choice to embrace “magnificently shattered” portraiture. The cost—loss of her former celebrated self—is legible in the final image. Minor slip: the phrase “necessary darkness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the edge of embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—"serene anger" and "consciously wild methodology" are embodied in the ink ritual and tent angles—but the final shift from anger to understanding is asserted more than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page seals the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—archivist duty vs. truth-released—are embodied and acted upon; the final upload forfeits her job and reputation with visible, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her pacifist stance is tested when her father arrives, forcing a micro-choice—teaching him to plant—that costs her the solitude of her practice. The father’s exhaustion and slow sheathing of the weapon show credible contradiction and earned change. Minor slip: “senselessly perceptive” is label-speak not fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kova’s cool-headedness is embodied in micro-choices—steady breath, deliberate zigzag cast, refusal to panic—yet the interior contradiction (heart hammering against practiced stillness) is dramatized rather than labeled. The rail spike’s warming and the echo’s transliteration of her emotions make the cost visible. The final acceptance of the goddess’s echo reconfigures her voice, foreclosing the old fisher identity with felt cost. Only the grandmother backstory is summary, not re-weighted, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margot’s contradictory impulses—truth vs. dynasty—are dramatized in real time through micro-choices (the trembling nib, the sealed letter). The final renunciation of honesty is earned by the prior proof and carries visible cost: she kisses the nib goodbye and locks it away. Interiority is specific and embodied; no stock phrases. The only drag is a brief diagnostic self-label “devotedly observant,” but it is quickly overwritten by action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's contradictory impulses—compassion for deleted code vs certainty she will write the letters—are dramatized through tactile choices (cracked amber, humming needles). The renunciation of personal heirloom amber buys the firmware’s memorial at visible cost: proboscis twitches, future obligation. Interiority is character-particular across shifts from static to music to mathematics.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seraphina’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulse to impose order while sensing the grotto’s anxiety is dramatized through micro-choices (sand placement, tile touch). The final renunciation—leaving the mandala to be scattered—earns its cost via prior causality and visible flaw (need for control). Minor slip: “socially perceptive” is asserted more than enacted in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Reconciliation of mercy with steel arms arcs across all beats; however, final stance crystallizes with elegant economy rather than contradictory impulse collision. Slight emotional ventriloquism—‘a strange, cold warmth’—mildly undercuts authentic embodied experience at apex.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cornelius’s synesthetic ghosthood and longing for Isabella are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the final reunion is earned through his echo-conducting agency. Interiority is specific—tastes of honey-copper, cardamom, strawberries—never generic. The only minor slip is Isabella’s near-instant solidity, which feels slightly under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s embodied somatic compass and willowglass hope are vivid, contradictory, and drive every micro-choice; David’s skepticism softens through tactile wonder, creating a crucible that alters their bond. The static-shock backstory is anchored in present gel-powder action and tilts her stance without summary overload. Cost is felt when she risks permanent exposure of hidden pathways. Minor slip: David’s interiority is slightly ventriloquized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—her fingertips “taste” temperature, the fossil’s warmth against her chest—but the final choice to “teach others to hear” is asserted rather than dramatized; no micro-choice in-scene shows the cost of that commitment. The contradiction between her solitary mapping and communal mission is stated, not embodied in a beat that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is consistent (‘catalogued by Mara... the hourglass turner... worked in unearthed silence’) and her shift from past-preserver to future-spinner is embodied on-page. Yet she remains too flawlessly prescient—every button-match, resonance, and spiral-layout plays out without missteps or inner contradiction, dulling the felt cost she bears.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margot’s contradictory impulses—rage at betrayal versus need for purpose—are embodied in the tightening around the pillbox and the choice to descend. The final “no longer burned but forged” crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Minor: Viktor’s apology feels slightly expository, not fully lived in his body.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thomas enacts a palpable micro-choice—safeguarding the woman’s remaining hope—earned by the ritual shown. Interiority stays embodied: impassive posture, “practice[d] stillness,” but his needle’s motion is his real stair-step of intention. A single other character on stage limits depth of status dynamics yet leaves seamless single-POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei’s interiority is textured—clay, silk, memory—but her decisive choice (to leave the oasis without taking) is only implied; the cost is present yet under-dramatized. The potter’s patience is well embodied, but the moment of renunciation lacks a micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marina’s interiority is embodied and specific—trembling fingers, the brass edge catching moonlight—but the “wistfully pragmatic certainty” is asserted rather than dramatized. Her micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the gauge into the dock) align with motive and foreclose the path of clinging to the past. The cost is felt: leaving the heirloom behind. Secondary characters are off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—bone-deep memory of tundra, “brittle awakening” embodied in sternum vibration—yet her final stance (“coexist with absence”) arrives more as lyrical assertion than earned micro-choice; no concrete cost is dramatized on the page. Marcus functions as gentle chorus, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is textured and embodied—her fingers tracing the twig spiral, the “prismatic quiet” of her voice—but the final reconciliation with Chen leans on a shared epiphany rather than a choice that visibly costs her. The contradiction between ghostwriting others’ hearts and withholding her own is dramatized in the installation act, yet the emotional risk feels slightly under-registered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, burnt-coffee air—but her contradictory impulses (hope vs dread) are summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to keep vigil is credible yet the cost feels generalized (“universe had become more dangerous”) rather than embodied. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are embodied in micro-choices—memorizing escape routes, pocketing the compass, letting music guide steps. Interior contradiction peaks when fear should paralyze yet curiosity propels him into the nexus. The final ascent shows earned change: boundaries are now “waiting to be redrawn,” a credible renunciation of his former limits with visible cost—he carries two compasses and altered perception. One slip: the phrase “something altogether more paradoxical had returned” edges into label-speak, blunting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sarah’s prosopagnosia and artistic method are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (charcoal gradients, ribbon on finger) that reveal interior contradiction; the final renunciation—portraits as evidence—carries visible cost. Interiority stays embodied, never diagnostic. One slip: “seventeen proofs” edges toward summary label in the last paragraph, blunting the earned edge.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific certainty vs inherited guilt—are embodied in her grip on the copper nail and her micro-choice to broadcast the coordinates under evacuation alarms. The cost is palpable: she forfeits safety to finish Lydia’s work. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only Hayward’s off-stage voice limits relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marla’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling bow, the warm wood against her chin—but the hitchhiker’s motives remain abstract, diffusing the relational crucible. The final choice to keep playing is earned by the glass-flake epiphany, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s calm, methodical agency is embodied and consistent; his micro-choices (rearranging bills, planting artifacts) escalate stakes and foreclose paths with visible cost. Interiority is specific—he inherits “perceptive calm” and wields it as deterrent. The father’s legacy and Chen’s recognition create credible pressure and earned renunciation. Minor: Chen’s interiority is inferred, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her fingertip on the telegram, her fatigue, her “strange resonance” when speaking—but the moment of choice (placing the memory card) is under-dramatized; we see the gesture but not the internal contradiction that would make it cost. The previous chronicler’s madness is reported, not embodied, so the inherited burden feels second-hand. Still, her voice is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is specific—his “warlike serenity” is embodied in the dive and the pulse of the seed. The ancestor’s sacrifice is shown through Kael’s discovery rather than exposition. Motivation pivots cleanly from proving innocence to accepting inherited guilt-as-gift, with the seed’s weight as embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s root-bound trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing the clipping, tracing scars) and drives her to anchor the timeline; the final “roots and wings” crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the future-self mirror beat edges toward convenient exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. the orchard’s warning—are dramatized in the trembling reach for the apple; the final fusion of destinies is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of singular self). Interiority is embodied and specific, though the keeper’s dialogue edges toward thematic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—clinical detachment vs. visceral memory—are embodied in the tactile handling of the cloth; the final choice to authenticate from lived loss rather than paperwork is earned and carries visible cost (reputation risk, emotional exposure). Interiority is specific and character-bound, avoiding therapy-speak. The only minor slip is a slightly abstract “longing not as emptiness but as space” that edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sarah’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip on the tablet, the warmth of the seed on her tongue. The contradiction between scholarly detachment and inherited obsession is dramatized in the moment she swallows the seed, paying the cost of merging with prior keepers. The “kindly methodical” trait is shown through her tactile care with artifacts and her hesitation before ingestion. Closure is earned: she becomes the text she once studied, a living bridge with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaine’s contradictory impulses—mechanical/new-moon vs organic/full-moon, rooted librarian vs mobile guardian—are dramatized in her titan-gear clicks and the choice to hand over the creel. The final image of her “mechanical heart beating in time with the tides” crystallizes an earned stasis that accepts perpetual flux. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids label-speak. Only the visitor’s chord-voice edges toward abstraction, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses (“inspecting bunkers because she is terrified of living above ground”) play out in-scene: the knife-edge hesitation, the physical act of etching, and the immediate after-effect—pulled phone, readiness to call mother and Marcus. The confession is not a summary; it is embodied in the sweat-cold moment where she risks emotional exposure. The final cost is visible: she marks the facility “Unsuitable,” knowingly surrendering her protective cover story. Interiority is compressed, specific, and never lapses into therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s guilt-driven compulsion is embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing ivy, drawing on the wall) and culminates in a credible renunciation of map-making for witness; the interior contradiction between methodical science and frozen paralysis is dramatized, not told. One slip: “frozen on the bank” is summarized rather than re-lived in scene, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative but abstract; the veiled dreamer's motives (find the library, document dreams) are declared rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses surface under pressure—she proceeds with calm certainty. The final self-recognition arrives as elegant CR yet lacks prior dramatized struggle to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—career ambition vs moral duty—play out in real time; the choice to forge papers while encoding truth is a sharp micro-choice that costs her the empire she coveted. Interiority is specific (mulberry-wine taste of the lie, jasmine’s whisper) and embodied. The final renunciation feels earned because the violin’s justice mechanism was seeded early and her flaw (over-cleverness) drives the trap she sets for Marcus.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her measured breaths, steady hands, the contradiction of preserving beauty while death closes in. The shift from beautician to mortician to threshold-keeper is dramatized through micro-choices (harvesting the chip, tracing symbols, pressing it to the star’s heart). The final stance—choosing eternal almostness—carries visible cost as the Silence locks her in place. Only the “lucidly watchful” label feels slightly external; the rest is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her weathered hands, the jade pin, the vineyard memory—yet the climactic “unlocking” feels slightly abstract, not fully earned by prior micro-choices. The kindly decisive trait is dramatized in her pruning metaphor and patient guidance, but the final beat leans on ancestral voice-over rather than her own decisive act. Still, the contradiction between grief and forgiveness is kept alive in scene, and the cost of eternal return is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s grief and guilt are embodied in the hollow mirror shard and his tremulous voice, but the Arbiter remains a cipher—no interior contradiction or micro-choice undercuts his authority, so the relationship never becomes a crucible. The final “terrible gift” lands as a conceptual cost rather than a felt one for the Arbiter, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s reverse-aging paradox and her guarded pedagogy are vivid and embodied; the withheld truth is dramatized through the trance and the pond’s rings. Marcus’s dawning recognition supplies credible micro-choice pressure. The final renunciation—“to become the absence that makes presence visible”—carries visible conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yula’s interiority is vivid and embodied—dust as second skin, arrowhead against sternum—yet her contradictory impulses (movement vs stillness) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The Earned Stasis of “I am still here” carries visible cost, but the micro-choice that seals it is implied rather than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—failure at the Academy yet refusal to surrender wonder—remains embodied and specific; the keystone’s warmth and the act of unstrapping the medallion crystallize her values under pressure. The final renunciation (returning to the world below) carries visible cost: she forfeits institutional validation for an unquantifiable magic. However, the grandmother’s whispered advice is slightly abstract, softening the causal hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marlow’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her synesthetic perception is shown through concrete sensory choices (“Elena’s name rippled outward in concentric rings of deep violet”). The luminous vows and hotel key function as charged objects that reweight her stance. The final acceptance of her sister’s legacy is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she forecloses ordinary life to become a beacon for others. Minor slip: the phrase “pretending our perception was madness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voss’s contradictory impulses—quiet enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt—are embodied in her trembling fingers on the coins and the “gnawing” radiation of uncertainty. The final choice to become the decision itself is foreshadowed by every micro-choice of casting, and the cost (eternal recursive duty) is felt in the closing image. Interiority is specific and non-diagnostic, avoiding stock phrases. The only minor slip is a touch of abstract self-diagnosis in “cognitive dissonance of existing in a causal loop,” but it is brief and contextually earned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—grief folds the atlas “soft as grief,” fear crystallizes into named monsters. The reaper’s contradictory impulses (duty vs. longing) coexist in the same beats. The final act—folding the now-named monsters back into her coat—earns the Earned Stasis with visible cost: eternal loneliness accepted. Only minor slip: the “love-bargain” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting motive edge.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s “mediocre magic” and “earnest naïveté” are embodied in her meticulous micro-choices—suspending the bell, pressing palms to stone, channeling weak power—each action revealing a hierarchy of values (precision over force). Internal contradiction is present but subtle: her self-doubt (“laughed at by the Academy”) versus stubborn conviction. The final collapse against the railing crystallizes the cost of her endurance. Yet the voice drifts toward explanatory summary in the last paragraph, softening the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—methodical duty vs. buried guilt—surface in the pharmacy beat; the micro-choice to pocket the bottle and photograph Elena’s image forecloses the official lie with visible cost. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, mirrored hush) rather than labeled. The final stance crystallizes: he will testify, not merely record. One slip: the grandmother backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—sentimentality vs. pure reason—is embodied in the micro-choice to sublimate the crystal; the cost (loss of preserved wonder) is legible and scales to the word count. Backstory is anchored in present cues and tilts her stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the parachute-buckle tic and “watcher’s burden” crystallize her stakes. The final lie and shift from observer to guardian feel earned by prior tension. Secondary character (voice on radio) applies immediate pressure, though we learn little of them. Overall, a credible, flawed protagonist whose micro-choice reconfigures her path.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s numbness is embodied in the glass jar and mirrored sparring, but the interior contradiction—wanting feeling yet fearing merger—stays stated rather than dramatized until the final beat. The micro-choice to lift the jar crystallizes motive, yet the cost of creating a “child” is asserted, not felt. Secondary pressure from Master Chen is clear but generic; his dialogue reads as exposition. Overall, a credible arc with visible stakes, but emotional embodiment could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, recognition of the seed, and nightly tending—but the shift from puzzle-solver to guardian feels slightly under-motivated; the note’s directive “Build more. Teach others” lands as external prompt rather than earned culmination of her contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s grief-driven compulsion is embodied in every micro-choice—arranging blowers, conducting, singing lullabies—yet the interior contradiction (mournful yet eager) stays vivid. The final renunciation (he will return monthly) forecloses rest and carries felt cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (Bobby’s memory) is anchored by present cue and tilts tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Guardian’s feral descent—bones of winter glass inside her ribs, pupils gone vertical—rings embodied and singular. Interior conflict fissures cleanly when scholar offers double homecoming: ransom her frozen vigil or risk final oblivion. The moment she relinquishes the pendant, loss (armor of certainty) and gain (restored language) clash in one charged poise. Grade dents not at closure but where earlier description slips into compressed, almost mythic shorthand—still, choice feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—yearning for miracle yet steeped in failure—drives every beat; the embodied shame (“heard every whisper through stone walls”) and the micro-choice to burn the first half of the crozier crystallize his arc. The final grasp of the living staff is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost (his own blood). Minor slip: “stoically sensitive” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s solitude delivers interiority of exquisite particularity—“fingers tingle under gloves”; internal contradictions felt in real time; final stance of teaching carries visible cost of abandoning Guild security; flaw of assumption-rejection drives her every beat. Only absence of on-page companion limits relationship crucible, but solo voice is coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific (Hourglass ‘hummed’, sideways clocks) and his resilience modulates into choice at the end, but the final moment—using the hourglass as catalyst—doesn’t feel like a hard choice Marcus makes; it shifts to universal convergence, diluting personal agency to a witness-role.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Chosen POV offers fever-state interiority and embodied emotion, yet interior risk/want hierarchy stays abstract until near end; the architect’s calm unsettles and choices alter gallery space, but final renunciation feels somewhat pre-declared rather than earned under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “somber marvel” and tactile turning of the chain link embody wonder and weight—but her agency is largely pedagogical; she teaches rather than chooses, so the final stance crystallizes more as earned stasis than active renunciation. The students’ wonder is sketched rather than dramatized, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her embodied listening, the copper taste of interference—but the “incidental heroism” is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene, so the final run feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s claustrophobia is embodied (tight chest, “suffocating weight”) and drives her forward; the promise to Marcus and the gold-flecked journal anchor her renunciation at the end with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and micro-choices (sealing the journal, yearly return) crystallize values. The single POV is consistent; no status dynamics needed. Closure choice is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—clinging to physical proof via heartbeat counts while courting digital dissolution—are embodied in the ink-bridge ritual; the final acceptance of dual existence is earned through prior trial-and-error, with the porcelain shard as tactile anchor. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Cost is felt: he must live bifurcated, teaching others tomorrow while remaining exiled tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the copper veins and diamond curse anchor contradictory impulses. Motivation to “translate texture into sound” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices. Final renunciation—becoming bone tower—earns cost via prior causality. Minor slip: “quietly articulate” stated more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—arrowhead warmth, gravity laughter—but her final “I’ll join them” leap feels slightly under-cooked; Thorne’s grief is embodied in trembling soil, yet his release is told more than dramatized. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. reunion) are present but compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty, nostalgia vs. rebellion) play out in embodied micro-choices like pressing the seed into her palm. The final renunciation—playing herself empty—earns its cost through prior mapping of rhythms and the visible shattering of her safety. Minor slip: “remembered gentle” is a fragment that blurs the guardian’s recovered agency.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ezra’s quiet, embodied choices—adjusting the mailbag, scanning absences, cradling the bottle—reveal a layered interiority that deepens under pressure. The final hand-off to the Keeper crystallizes his renunciation of official duty for a higher loyalty, costing him the safety of documented routes. Interior contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper moment of self-doubt would have pushed this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority vivid and embodied; Emil’s grief-muted world is concrete through carpentered “sawdust drifted… shafts of light” and micro-choice to pocket the glass. The decisive change—song over silence—earns through causality: grandfather’s humming, cracked voice, felt cost (risk of being heard again). Internal contradiction (silence vs need to respond) kept alive through the fragment’s magnetic pull. Quiet persistence made procedural rather than declarative—each carved horse an accumulated promise.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured—his ritual tracing of spines, the scarf as memory conduit—but the “sanely eccentric” label is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is forced into costly choice. The final recognition is resonant yet feels gifted by the library rather than earned through a prior micro-choice that visibly costs him something.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to resurrect her grandmother’s love yet sensing the personal cost—are dramatized in the final beats when she lowers the palette. Interiority is specific and embodied; the warmth leaving her chest is a concrete price. The renunciation is earned and forecloses the path of further vitalizations, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the slight abstraction in “luminous absence” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—competent locksmith vs. bearer of radical courage—drives every beat; the lock of hair as genetic memory is embodied, not exposited. Micro-choices (stepping into the upward shadow, bleeding fingers) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Final renunciation of safety is earned by prior causality. Only the “unassumingly bold” label feels slightly external rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margaret’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “headlamp caught the first constellation” shows perception under pressure. The micro-choice to kneel and place the mushroom at the ring’s center crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Flawed curiosity and inherited duty collide believably; the cost of absorbing memories is felt on the page. The final stance—carrying the memories forward—earns its charge through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs. walking-backward reflex—are embodied in micro-moves and charged dialogue; Kess’s grief and dawning agency are likewise concrete. The final choice to annotate together is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her “weathered hands,” the “color that had no name”—and her creative compulsion drives every beat. The final act of planting while weaving worlds is a credible renunciation of safety, with the cost of lifelong solitude legible in her smile. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Reflection stays under 20 % and alters tactics via dream-derived plan.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—scarred fingers, dream-logic hands, inherited craft—yet her contradictory impulses (duty vs. fatigue) remain under-dramatized; the final renunciation of rest carries visible cost in “knowing tomorrow would bring another net,” earning a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—precision vs. intuition—remains vivid; her micro-choice to film herself embodies shielded openness. Yet because no second character shares the vault the status bullets remain latent. Backstory is woven via the torn map cue; no knowledge leaks. Final cost is palpable when she presses palm to parchment.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina's "first name basis with death" trait is shown through concrete action—her decades listening to ocean death-whispers, the precise transmission transcription, her catalogued recoveries. Interiority reveals contradictory impulses: professional detachment versus private ache when the snow-globe mini-library mirrors her vocation. The final note ("every ending is a frequency shift") is earned by her witnessed micro-choice to document rather than to haul artifacts; she forecloses treasure-hunting and accepts archival immortality at visible cost. Emotion stays embodied, not labeled, and flaws (curator versus mourner tension) persist.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Chorus embodies contradiction—human warmth yet data-hungry tool—through her bodily micro-choice to press the rose while servers shiver. Cost is felt when the courtyard graffiti shifts, proving her own voice must now be permanently tuned to electrical dreams. Interiority remains specific and embodied; no stock epiphanies mar the choice. The earned renunciation of future solitude is legible, if lightly stated; an extra layer of embodied cost within the final image would break the cap.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and embodied—her gloved fingers, the warmth unfurling hidden ink—yet her contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity) remain mostly summary until the final beat. The moment she tucks the diary into her apron and smiles at the goggles crystallizes a credible shift from caretaker to inheritor, with the cost of abandoning the frozen-grief myth she’d half-believed.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and consistent—her inherited obsession and refusal of rescue are embodied in micro-choices (adjusting the telescope, declining helicopters). The contradiction between scientific duty and poetic belief is present but never crystallizes into a single irreversible act; the ending drifts rather than renounces, so the cost feels diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s prosopagnosia is woven into every tactile choice; her final realization that “faces are merely one form of identity” is earned through embodied action with mirrors and coin. Interior contradiction surfaces when she both mourns and transcends her limitation, culminating in a visible renunciation (she walks away carrying the sky). The only drag is a brief diagnostic label “prosopagnosia had stolen that gift at birth,” but it is immediately dramatized by touch-based perception.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—the need for sociable isolation—grounds her motivation.  Her micro-choice to follow each murmuration crystallizes the hierarchy of values: knowledge over company, re-charting lost paths.  Only nudge-down: the polyglot book arrives late as a prop, and the cost she pays feels more conceptual than embodied in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is particular: the memory of her village shivering without starlight sharpens every micro-choice she makes among the gears, and her renunciation of force in favor of “listening to the locks” carries a felt cost that lands in the final image. The grandfather’s obsession is threaded back into present action by the ticking metallic breath of each gear, anchoring reflection in choice rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s ghostly altruism is vivid and embodied, but her interiority is sketched more than dramatized; the brass bell’s final materialization is a powerful earned cost, yet her contradictory impulse (linger vs. fade) is stated rather than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his recognition of the cracked puppet as a map of his own suffering is embodied and specific. The transfer of the “burden” from Eliza to Marcus is dramatized through touch and song, not summary. Cost is felt: he relinquishes purely mechanical adjustment for a gentler, riskier lullaby. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to flee yet tethered by duty—are embodied in her compulsive handling of the walnut and her practiced lie. The final renunciation (handing over the seed) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she remains bound. Interiority is specific and embodied (“graceless beauty of someone who’d learned efficiency over elegance”). Minor slip: the father/child are sketched more as functions than crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her grief is tactile in the pocketed chrysalis and loosened by foam observation. The contradiction between control (formulas) and acceptance (symphonic thinking) is dramatized in the final text to Elena. Micro-choice to release the chrysalis and send the text carries visible cost. One slip: “learning to think symphonically” edges toward label-speak, blunting the epiphany’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Merrick’s interiority is vivid—his habit of “quantifying absence” is a concrete, character-specific lens—but the child’s motivation is delivered in a single declarative burst rather than embodied contradiction; the final renunciation (“some shops open not to sell…”) is earned yet stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miran’s contradictory impulse—flee vs. metabolize regret—is embodied in the tremor before she presses palms to the pool; the cost (bearing centuries of grief) is felt, but interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she understood now”) rather than live contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marta’s empathetically decisive trait is dramatized through her polyglot singing and pendulum rigging; the contradictory pull between private grief and communal hope is embodied in her chest-cavity vibration. Interiority stays concrete (“practiced grace,” “stored memories of abundance”) and avoids label-speak. The final choice—descending to join neighbors—earns its cost by the overnight labor and the irrevocable shift from isolation to chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremors through her consciousness”), but the transformation arc leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final renunciation—carrying the dreams inside her—earns its cost yet feels slightly pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orin’s prism-mind and archivist vocation are vividly embodied; the final choice to seed new warnings is earned by the grotto ordeal. Interiority is specific, but the “civilization’s immune system” line edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “symphonically minded” perception is dramatized through tactile choices with the porcelain insulator. The single POV holds; her empathy drives every micro-choice, and the final renunciation (setting down the cracked tool) carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Viktor’s contradictory impulses—yearning for return vs. choosing exile—are embodied in the thumb on the stone and the final gift of it to Mira; the cost of renunciation is felt. Interiority is concrete (thumb in dent, pieces sliding by magnetism). Mira serves as crucible, her question forcing his crystallized stance. Minor slip: “beauty lives in difficulty” drifts toward aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s pacifist identity and obsession with silence are embodied in tactile micro-choices—fine-tuning dials, touching worn leather—that escalate to the final beat where she chooses transcription over possession. Interior contradiction (collector of war radios yet pacifist) remains latent rather than dramatized in scene, costing the score a hairline slip. The earned cost is the shift from hunter to listener, foreclosing the path of forced entry.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s olfactory sensitivity and ambition are embodied in every beat—she smells soil acidity, fungal threat, the flower’s dreams—yet her interiority never slips into label-speak. The final sway with the village, breathing the stench she once feared, is a credible renunciation of her old rush toward mastery and carries visible cost. Only the elders remain off-page archetypes, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kessa’s motive is lucid—resilience research drives every move—but interior contradiction is thin: she never doubts the search or fears the cost. The arrow-monument interaction supplies the sole moment where her internal values surface, choosing wonder over immediate agronomic gain. Emotional cost is implied rather than embodied—no tremor or fatigue registers. Still, her trajectory feels consistent and singular, avoiding stock phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s adaptability is embodied through methodical foresight and cost-bearing choices; interiority is precise, toolkit-driven rather than abstract. The patch pick-up intertwines motive with escalating inquiry, anchoring a quiet but earned resilience. No generic science-voice intrudes; every reflection settles into mechanical detail and bodily fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyrian’s synesthetic gift and her quiet defiance of the Council are vivid, but interior contradiction is underplayed; the moment she “understood—this wasn’t meant for bells at all” arrives as summary rather than embodied struggle, muting the cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kessa’s contradictory urge to return not for redemption but understanding embodies the story; embodied tremor, driftwood marking, and the canyon breath deepen interiority. The failure-mandated shift “guardianship ended… role just begun” crystallizes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—simultaneously preserving and dissolving selves—drives every micro-choice; the final “smiled with seventeen different mouths” crystallizes the cost of accumulated empathy. Borrowed personalities wrestle in real time, not summary, and the halo fragment’s pressure forces a stance that forecloses any return to a single self. The only cap is a hairline slip: the phrase “mathematics of emotion” edges toward diagnostic label-speak mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's tremor-turned-resonance supplies a vivid embodied contradiction; the luminous transference from mentor to bridge is credibly motivated rather than abstracted. However, the final self-discovery (“Corvin’s greatest discovery had been her all along”) edges into tidy epiphany rather than a contradiction still in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s interiority is specific—her tactile communion with the prism and the frost-map feel lived-in—but the “thirty years as a mystic” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the cost of her isolation. The final moment of triumph lands as earned because her earlier micro-choices (angling the prism, photographing the frost) directly precipitate it.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mei’s contradictory impulses—love for her daughter vs. terror of memory loss—are embodied in the shuttle’s rhythm; each pass of thread is a micro-choice that visibly forfeits a memory, culminating in the earned hollowing that forecloses any return to self. The interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak, and the final smile without a name is a credible renunciation scaled to the story’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Korin’s meekness-as-listening is embodied in every hammer-stroke; the contradictory impulse to refuse power yet wield it charges the final gift. His interiority stays concrete (“metal remembered everything”) and the cost—descending alone, forging with dream-silk—is visible. The merchant’s tremor externalizes the blade’s emotional price, completing a crucible relationship. Only the grandmother backstory drifts toward label rather than lived scar.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic translations, embodied urgency—but her contradictory impulses (map vs. heal) are stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The mother’s exhaustion is sketched economically, yet their reunion dialogue tilts toward exposition. Closure choice (map the repairs) is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elsa’s reticence and comfort in solitude are dramatized through her stone-reading habit and her unhesitating ascent; the final acceptance of guardianship is earned by these traits. Interiority is concrete (“sea glass… pulsing with captured moonlight”). The ghost chorus is sketched lightly yet exerts pressure, keeping cast within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot climb, stardust breathing, and laughter as compass all embody motive—but the mirror-twin arrives late and functions more as symbol than crucible, blurring the cost of her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—dye-whispers, heart-rhythm estrangement—and his micro-choice to “teach me” crystallizes a credible shift from passive absorption to active illumination. The granddaughter remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived; Chen functions as mentor, not co-protagonist. Cost is felt: the inherited heart’s weight and the morpho wing’s warning both foreclose the option of hoarding stories. One hairline slip: “quietly explosive” is asserted rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured—his weathered hands, the moonlight’s tingle, the “weight of absence”—but the decisive pivot from caretaker to re-architect of grief is compressed into a single beat. The 30-year tenure is asserted rather than embodied; we see the shift in purpose, not the accumulated scar tissue that would make the renunciation costlier. Still, his final smile carries a credible, earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied (hand on mica, feeling for warmth) and her micro-choices (“tried everything else… began with a whisper”) drive causality; the contradiction between solo duty and communal remedy is dramatized, though her flaws remain fairly mild. The renunciation of despair in favor of iterative collective singing is earned and carries visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ezra’s contradictory impulses—empathic pull vs. self-protective retreat—are dramatized in the moment he chooses to approach the woman; the cost (absorbing her grief) is embodied and visible. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic, and the final micro-choice to share the invitation crystallizes his arc. Minor slip: the phrase “enlarged tranquility” edges toward label-speak mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“smelling of rosemary and time”), but the final epiphany—“her strange gift…was not madness but ministry”—leans toward diagnostic label-speak rather than earned contradiction. Micro-choices (planting seeds, accepting tea) align with motive, yet the cost of her new vocation is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the grandmother’s eyes and the seeds in Lila’s palm give a tactile, character-specific anchor that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet, compulsive preservation instinct is dramatized through every micro-choice—calipers, prism, frost-numbed fingers—showing a life-long habit that still cracks under impossible loss when she whispers "I promise to begin again." The interior clash—order vs. annihilation—grounds the final vow, making it feel like a hard-won renunciation rather than rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; Mae’s curiously steadfast purpose manifests through the micro-choice to trust the market’s bloodline rule. Yet the final beat slides into thematic articulation—her realization that “some sounds… are worth the breaking” edges toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—tasting compass directions, neural implants pulsing doubt—but the climactic acceptance (“implants blazed…then shifted to aurora green”) feels compressed; the cost of abandoning lifelong skepticism is asserted more than embodied. Secondary carriers are sketched rather than pressured, so relationship crucible is thin. Still, her contradictory impulses (doubt vs. lineage) are dramatized in scene and culminate in a credible renunciation of her former stance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s contradictory impulses—perfect recall vs. raw creation—are dramatized in the charcoal-on-crystal act; the final renunciation of her “museum of perfect memory” is earned and costly. Interiority is embodied (charcoal under nails, cracked chest) rather than labeled. The only minor slip is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is specific—her lie-detecting tremors, the refusal of gold ink, her loneliness from being “too trusted”—yet the grandmother’s confession reads as convenient backstory rather than earned contradiction. Her final choice to deliver every truth is stated without a felt on-page cost; we are told the city will dissolve, not shown her facing the first leaf-shocked recipient. Emotional summary (“some truths were worth wilting for”) replaces embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mariel’s silence and vocation ground every moment; yet interiority remains abstract ('wonder itself', 'capacity for enchantment') rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. We feel her resolve but not her fear or regret. Enough presence to pass, short of visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    M-47’s interior contradiction—static vs. stewardship—drives every beat; the trembling ceramic fingers, warmth in synthetic musculature, and final steady reach for the watering can embody the arc. Motivation shifts from servitude to continuity, earned by the controlled burn that costs the android its fragmented past. The absence of Sarah on-page limits relationship crucible, but the android’s solitary choices still foreclose the path of abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta’s curator identity is established early and her micro-choice to “follow where it led” drives the plot; Elena’s arc from silence to voice is embodied and credible. Interiority stays concrete, but the large supporting cast dilutes relationship crucible pressure. Final renunciation (Elena claims the courtyard as home) carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s embodied decryption and the inherited dance-memory are vivid and specific; her micro-choices (each splash, the dice landing on its corner) reveal motive and stakes. The final recognition—“Welcome home, granddaughter”—earns its emotional cost through prior causal setup. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic label-speak. A hairline slip: the phrase “destiny settled on her shoulders like an old coat” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—yearning to reclaim Elena yet choosing to re-bury the memories—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (digging, lifting, returning the vial). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she keeps only one vial, accepting the ache. Interiority is embodied, not labeled. Minor slip: “crystalline clarity” edges toward diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The summoner’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile communion with the glade, the “patient as a shepherd” patience, the felt cost of dispersing futures. Motive is consistent and intensifies: from quiet custodian to active guardian willing to erase her own footprints. The Earned Stasis of leaving “only footprints that the brook would soon smooth away” carries visible cost. Minor slip: mentor flashback is summary rather than embodied memory.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory of the cornerstone, the brass seal in her pocket—but the final “teach me” beat feels slightly under-motivated; we haven’t seen her hesitate or weigh cost, so the shift to mentor reads smooth rather than compelled. Marcus’s pressure is gentle yet legible, and their shared flaw (hearing buildings) crystallizes the relationship crucible. The earned cost is present but diffuse: she relinquishes solitude without dramatized fear of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—yearning for peace yet haunted by its price—are embodied in the bleeding palm and the shell’s pull. Micro-choices (digging, pressing halves together) reveal a hierarchy of values culminating in earned integration. The flaw of self-erasure drives every beat; the cost is the reopened wound of grief. Only the “tragically radiant” label edges toward diagnostic speak, blunting full 9.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei’s contradictory impulses—duty to family vs. moral awakening—are dramatized through the micro-choice of burning both forgeries; the cost (loss of anonymity, exposure of family crimes) is felt on the page. Interiority is embodied in the pulse of the sanctuary and the blood bead on the thorn. The final renunciation is earned by prior causal beats: every forged document she recalls justifies her confession. Only the grandmother’s off-stage voice keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.7)
    Senna's interiority is specific—her bone ache from the shell frequency, the inherited alto that once lulled—yet her final submission feels foreordained rather than torn from contradiction; the cost is felt but lacks micro-resistance. The inherited “richly perceptive” gift never wrestles with another part of her as it is turned into instrumentality. Voice integration is coherent, but the moment of decision reads more ascension than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—gloves, melted plastic, borrowed starlight—but her contradictory impulses (treasure vs. truth) are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; the final “climb toward the surface” is earned yet cost is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers, the firefly on her wrist—but the “philosopher” label is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradiction is staged in-scene. The final renunciation (leaving the tower) is credible yet low-cost; the net-mender’s flaw or struggle remains abstract. Still, the micro-choice to whistle farewell crystallizes her values and forecloses further vigil, satisfying the earned-stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s skeptical vocation and methodical reassembly of letters give him a sharp, consistent interiority; the final renunciation—burying truth to preserve sanctuary—carries visible moral cost and is fully earned by prior discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlowe’s “variant allegiance” is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“tomorrow tastes like copper”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels more symbolic than earned, lacking a palpable cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s shift from collector to translator is embodied in the micro-choice to seek Elena; his interiority is specific, and the final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost. The contradictory impulse—clinging to isolation while yearning for connection—plays out in the walk along the beach. Elena’s brief appearance supplies immediate pressure that alters Marcus’s stance. The earned stasis of continuing to live in the loft yet now welcoming visitors is credible and scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—bone-conducted song, trembling hands, ancestral weight—yet the final transformation (“became what the artifact needed”) is asserted more than dramatized, blurring the cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s seventeen-year vigil and embodied patience are credibly dramatized; the contradiction between wild impulse and sculpting restraint is shown in micro-choices (placing rods, breathing control). The final smile carries earned cost—she has traded her solitude for collective freedom. Tomás appears only to confirm off-stage action, so relationship crucible is minimal, but interior stakes are fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margot’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the lantern-triggered memory cascade is a credible, character-specific catalyst. The resignation micro-choice at the end is earned by the prior entangled memories and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “fortified vulnerability” is asserted rather than dramatized in body language.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliza’s embodied grief and micro-choices (threading copper, selecting tools) reveal inherited grace vs. Thomas’s rage; the final decision to play the box is earned and carries visible cost. Marcus’s motivation to “bridge chasms” is clear, though his interiority is thinner. The sibling mirroring is specific and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pioneer’s “yearning algorithm” is vividly embodied in her brass wings and copper veins, and her micro-choice to dive into the acid sea is earned by the prior transliteration beats. Interior contradiction surfaces in her refusal of mockery vs. her hunger for new frequencies. The final transformation carries a felt cost: she forfeits workshop safety and mechanical identity. Secondary characters serve only as chorus; their pressure is atmospheric rather than crucible-level, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tracing the Apollo-X patch, the lie to her supervisor—but the final self-archiving choice arrives with only inherited, not freshly dramatized, contradiction; the cost is implied rather than embodied in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on warm bark, shadows as bridges—but the keeper’s dialogue drifts into thematic exposition, flattening status tension. The final choice to carry seeds of transformation is earned, yet the keeper’s voice converges with hers, blurring distinct motive.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the parasol tip functions as a tactile rosary that anchors Marlene’s altered state. Motivation—learning the music of endings—drives her to volunteer for ice-watch, but the causal link between “loose grip on reality” and specific micro-choices remains more asserted than dramatized. The final renunciation (staying to listen) carries felt cost yet leans on lyrical summary rather than a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured—his tactile handling of the burned letter, the embodied memory of Elena’s tears, and the micro-choice to gesture Elena's daughter to the bench all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final endurance—accepting mentorship as a form of love’s continuance—carries visible cost (the hollowing of decades) and is rooted in prior causality. Minor slip: the “gently persuasive” trait is asserted more than dramatized in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative—"her exposed eye tracking the horizon" and scars that "mapped their own boundaries"—but the shift from passive understanding to active consecration feels slightly under-motivated; the prophet’s riddle lands more as thematic prompt than crucible. The final unmasking offers a resonant Earned Stasis, yet the cost (seven years of masked exile) is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “crystalline clarity” moment is embodied—but the story summarizes rather than dramatizes her decisive micro-choice to stage the exhibition; the cost is stated (“town council deadline”) rather than felt in a beat. Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Motivation is consistent, yet the final bodily participation of descendants is reported, not shown through her POV, muting earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s reticence and etymological obsession are embodied in micro-choices—holding the crystal, pocketing it, choosing silence—showing interior contradiction between institutional obedience and linguistic faith. The final refusal to testify in expected form crystallizes her arc with visible social cost. Yet her emotional range stays slightly narrow; more embodied contradiction mid-scene would lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ezra’s amnesiac-prophet condition is embodied through ritual chalk and driftwood, but the woman’s motives remain functional rather than crucible-tested; the final renunciation (Ezra accepts perpetual forgetting) is earned and carries visible cost in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ezra’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “luminous ache” and tactile tuning-fork choice crystallize her stance. Motivation (to document the ephemeral) is dramatized, not told, and the final renunciation of escape carries visible cost. Minor slip: the leap from “clock is broken” to “clock is launch mechanism” is asserted rather than earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “decisively kind hands that never tremble” crystallizes her stance under terminal pressure. The broken vinyl and the album project externalize her contradictory impulses (serene vs. fractured) and force a costly choice: spend her last weeks on a gift that will outlive her. Motivation stays rooted in her vocation; the final bow is earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: Dr. Williams functions more as sounding board than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s quietly deliberate precision and embodied micro-choices (tracing runes, turning the key) anchor her interiority; the mentor’s absence is felt as pressure rather than exposition. The inheritance of guardianship lands as credible renunciation with visible cost—she must “relearn everything” and seal her own curiosity. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is missed, but characterization remains consistent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thomas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory impulses of skepticism and forgiveness play out in micro-choices (pocketing the tooth, returning it). Elara’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters their shared state. The final renunciation—letting her leave—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Only a slight drift toward therapeutic self-diagnosis keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interiority is embodied and specific—her tactile memory of polishing, the weight of the glass, the “delighted laugh” that becomes wind-chimes. The shift from solitary search to communal teacher is earned through her grandfather’s cryptic legacy and the visible cost of sharing the secret. Minor slip: the phrase “earthbound star watcher” is slightly label-like, but the rest of the arc is grounded in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her amber pendant, the moss circles, the deliberate silence of her phone—but the final invitation to Marcus feels slightly under-motivated; we see her healing, not the moment she decides to share it. The contradiction between public exposure and private sanctuary is present yet not fully dramatized in scene. Still, her micro-choice to proffer the cutting crystallizes a credible shift from isolation to mentorship with visible cost: relinquishing sole guardianship of the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—clinging to stories while learning to release them—drives every beat; the final renunciation of the seashell is earned by prior obsession and carries visible cost in the emptied mist. Embodied emotion (“heartbeat seem thunderous”) grounds her without therapy-speak. Only the cameo parade feels slightly external, diluting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s whimsical tinker persona is sketched in adjective clusters; interiority is lyrical but generic, not bespoke to her quirks. The climactic choice—hum instead of tinker—is believable yet telegraphed by the premise. Contradictory impulses (faith vs rationalism) aren’t dramatized on-body.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers moving with the deliberate care of someone threading memories through needle eyes”), but the alchemist’s contradictory impulses remain implicit; her final smile and walk home feel earned yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-rooted; her decision to document rather than repair the timer crystallizes her arc. Yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral—no embodied price is shown on the page. Contradictory impulses (fix vs. preserve) are present but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile handling of the lamp burner, the seventeen-gram memory, and the whale-bone reverie all reveal contradictory impulses (to stay/leave, to weave/renounce). The final smile and the cooling brass crystallize an earned stasis that forecloses escape yet accepts its cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margaret’s interiority is embodied and specific—her knife “finds the wood’s heart with hauntingly practical precision” shows inherited muscle memory. The contradiction between grief and purposeful action is dramatized in micro-choices (carving numerals that “aren’t quite numbers”). The final renunciation—teaching workshops instead of clinging to relics—earns its cost through prior beats. Only the slight drift into reflective summary near the end keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the past while redefining her purpose—play out in embodied micro-choices (winding the camera wheel, pressing it to her ear). The ghost’s silent demand forces her to articulate and re-price her identity, culminating in an earned renunciation that costs her architect’s dream. Interiority is concrete, specific, and tied to tactile objects; no stock labels. The final nod-dissolve crystallizes a visible cost: she accepts the role of memory-keeper, foreclosing the old ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s curiosity and engineering mindset are credibly embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing pipes, opening valves), but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “hope” language that blurs contradiction. The final renunciation—she will return tomorrow—earns its cost through the embodied exhaustion of the resurrected fountain, yet the emotional layering feels slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the petrichor-triggered memory cascade and the micro-choice to “record this dawn's arrival with particular care” crystallize her arc. The contradiction between refuge and prison in the sanctuary is dramatized, not told. The final decision to split her life is earned by the prior weight of silence and memory, with visible cost: “today belonged to the glacial hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—running from her father’s lies while chasing others’—is embodied in the sundial and crystallizes in the final resolve to confront him. Micro-choice (pocketing the dial, standing to dock) signals the cost of abandoning thirty years of evasion. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present stance. Flaw (evasion) complicates every beat and is accepted, not balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—her tactile decoding of knots, the fulgurite glass as teaching tool—but the “philosophical seed collector” label is more stated than dramatized; the final choice to pass knowledge to the granddaughter is clear and motivated, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—writing others’ living obituaries while clinging to the thread’s map of healing—are embodied through micro-choices: winding thread round her wrist, recording Marcus’s ghost-vigil. Her interior contradiction crystallizes in “understanding the precise topography of loss”; the final refusal (renouncing closure for others) carries on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aldric’s interiority is rich and concrete, driving every beat of his desperate tenderness toward the egg; his sustained awe becomes a micro-choice that reweights the final image. The contradiction of hope against physical exhaustion is embodied consistently in trembling fingers and beard growth, which alter tactics under pressure. Balance would lose tension without Aldric’s specific sensorium guiding attempts and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya is fully inhabited; gestures embody past scars and present resolve, but the interior conflict between inherited fire and chosen compassion is occasionally summarized (“She understood fire's hunger...”) instead of performed in beat. The grafting act provides visible cost and renunciation, yet the final stance arrives more narrated than earned in micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his shift from skeptical tracker to ritual participant is embodied in the feather’s tremble and the box’s glow—but the woman remains a cipher; her “patient fury” is asserted, not dramatized, so relationship pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Keeper’s motivation—tending stars to “share light without using fire”—is stated early and reiterated, but her interiority stays abstract (“troubling serenity,” “made peace with it”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the gear and the sonar pings are handled, yet they never force a choice that costs her anything. The final beat is a static acceptance rather than an earned renunciation or decisive act. Characterization is atmospheric, not crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Martha’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “retracing practice cuts” and her nightly solitary poem-trades show contradictory impulses of solitude and communal grief. The spectral grandfather functions as pressure rather than gimmick, forcing her to “feel for the grain” of grief. The final renunciation—accepting his absence once the stone is finished—carries visible cost in her solitary reading of the hidden poem. Only the brief “thundering calm” label keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theodore’s obsessive precision and guilt are embodied in the rake-handle litany; his final act of confession at the pendulum’s pause crystallizes a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“ink-stained fingers,” “quill trembled”—but the story leans on exposition rather than live contradiction; the decisive act (hanging the maps) is under-motivated on the page, though the cost (ceding credit) is implied.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mariel’s compulsion to preserve music under totalitarian pressure is rendered through delicate embodied choices—transcribing notes in amber light, mixing ink with dust, choosing cloak over candle—each a micro-choice that escalates risk; the inner contradiction between obedience and rebellion is sustained without sentimentality, and her final act of wrapping scores in dust carries earned, visible cost, marking meaningful change.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority pulses through body and tool—ash slipping through fingers, porcelain edges biting cheek. Marlene’s contradiction is active: she offers escape yet embeds evidence; the mask both shields and indicts. That final walk across the portrait is a concrete renunciation that pays for every prior lie; her cost—becoming the very ash she erases—stays vivid. All micro-decisions are filtered through tactile POV, keeping psyche anchored in the gallery’s marble and ventilation hum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s motives—truth vs. isolation—are clear and embodied; the cog and journal physically test them. Interiority is specific (abrasive calm, “three years alone”). The final choice to descend is earned by prior agonizing and the woman’s pressure. Cost is felt: he surrenders solitary certainty for collaborative concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen’s interiority is specific and embodied—her finger tracing the rosette, her eyes filling—yet the final renunciation (“Take it”) is earned only by the communal epiphany, not by a prior interior contradiction that visibly costs her. The trait “expectantly resigned” is stated but not dramatized as a live tension inside her; the micro-choice to pass the zither feels externally prompted rather than internally compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories, hiding the seed in her mouth—yet the “informally wise” label is asserted rather than dramatized. Her final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“Let them try to burn this down”), but the contradiction between gentle rebellion and absolute certainty is not embodied in a micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s involuntary honesty and secret beekeeping create credible internal tension, and her final broadcast renunciation feels earned. Some emotional labeling (“terror,” “disappointment”) is generic, but embodied moments like the warm lacquer box under her palm compensate. Flawed, specific interiority holds steady. Earned stasis at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her cataloguing of “small wrongnesses” and the tactile warmth of the orris root crystallize her perceptual signature. The final choice to leave the shard is earned by her accumulating recognition of the houses’ grief and her own role as witness. One minor slip: the phrase “inadvertently profound” is authorial summary rather than embodied realization, blunting the cost momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thessaly’s centuries-long vigil and Marina’s immediate empathy create a believable crucible; the telepathic exchange is embodied, not abstract, and the final “animate with possibility” crystallizes a credible internal shift with visible cost—the statue’s new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s grim-optimist stance is embodied in every micro-choice—rolling the dice, counting steps, carving proofs—so motivation stays legible. Interiority is concrete (“texture of the missed opportunity was rough against his fingers”) and contradictory impulses (hope vs. proof) coexist in scene. The final renunciation—climbing on because mathematics guarantees rupture—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the off-page Sarah remains a faint silhouette, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—insomnia as bridge to memory, brush as conduit—but key moves (public posting, social miracle, group formation) leap over visible personal risk; no felt cost shows on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marta’s contradictory impulses—archival duty vs. the futility of rescue—play out in embodied micro-choices (trembling fingers, frantic tracing). The final renunciation of sleep to “work through the night” is earned by the accelerating thaw and carries visible cost.

    Elara’s contradiction-driven choices (clock craft vs. stone hunger) create a tangible, earned arc; her final renunciation crystallizes in the beam sweeping backward across water, foreclosing the path of forward-only time with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—repulsion and fascination—are embodied in her “gagging yet inhaling” the rot-ozone air. The clasp’s cold memory-photography externalizes her fear, and her final micro-choice to “break” the mirror of fear is earned by prior embodied stakes. Cornelius-as-guide remains peripheral, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority is specific and un-diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kessa’s interiority is embodied—heartbeat syncing with the orchard, muscles aching after the sonic labor—yet the text never over-articulates. Her flaw (solitary obsession) is the very engine of escape, and the cost (physical collapse, perpetual restlessness) is felt on the page. Motivation stays rooted in her prophet identity: reading clouds, translating currents into music. The final smile crystallizes an earned, costly stance: every new prison is merely an unplayed instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—ink bleeding under tremor, spiral charts as extension of mind—yet her final choice to leave is asserted more than dramatized; the “quietly driven” trait is shown but not tested under immediate duress. Cost is implied (she steps into the hatch alone) but not embodied in a moment of forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tracing the letter, the remembered weight of exile—but Marcus’s conflict is sketched rather than embodied, muting the crucible effect. The final renunciation (Marcus leaving his insignia) is legible but feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than wrenched from him.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Edmund’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in micro-choices—holding the satchel high, whispering to the cornerstone—yet the interior contradiction between official duty and private grief remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s motivation to preserve truth against systemic erasure is embodied in tactile micro-choices—touching spines, isolating frequencies, stamping pages. The contradiction between her quiet resolve and the ticking blackout clock creates credible pressure. Her final ascent with the stamp shows earned endurance and cost: she must leave the truth submerged until the next blackout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei’s grief is embodied in trembling fingers and the act of polishing; her contradictory impulse—grinding pain down while lifting love—drives every beat. The final choice to embed the gems in lanterns renounces recovery yet crystallizes love with visible cost. Interiority is specific and unflinching; no stock grief labels intrude. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amira’s grief-driven hunt is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (grief vs hope) clash in the scanner beat. The geode as memory-anchor and the choice to transmit data show earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kira’s desire to map is interiorly rich and embodied in every drone maneuver; micro-choice of placing the last chip crystallizes. The pilgrim serves functional pressure but her riddles tilt toward diagnostic voice rather than lived struggle, keeping her just under the 8 band. The final frequency settles into Kira; cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—manufacturing false histories while living one—is clearly rooted and embodied in scene, but the grandfather motive feels imported (brief reflection) rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the brass pull anchors contradictory impulses—vengeance and mercy—under pressure. The micro-choice to hand the pull to Thorne crystallizes her value hierarchy and forecloses easy revenge with visible cost. Reflection is brief, anchored in the object, and tilts her present stance. No slips in motivation or knowledge state.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s guilt and tentative re-engagement are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pocketing the compass, counting poles). Interiority is specific, but the final pivot to “teaching kayak navigation” feels slightly under-motivated—more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s guilt-without-memory paradox is embodied in the tender surgical scars and the way he pockets the impossible baseball; the final step onto the bridge crystallizes a renunciation that costs him the comfort of forgetting. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s contradictory drive—yearning for death yet fearing dissolution—remains embodied in trembling hands and paradoxical steadiness; the final choice to become a bridge is earned by the prior sensory ordeal and carries visible cost (loss of singular human form). Interiority is concrete, but the “cosmic intimacy” register drifts toward abstraction in the reunion beat, blunting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt over her mother’s death and fierce love for her newborn—are embodied in the cracked saucer and the onyx cards; her final act of laying the “restoration” spread is earned by prior causality and visibly costs her the safety of fixed regret. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the mother’s apparition is more symbol than second character, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei’s pacifism is embodied in micro-choices—tracing tears, uncapping the vial, stitching with intention—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she knew what waited”).

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory via the bugs while surrendering everything else—are embodied in her barefoot pacing and bottle-opening ritual. Motivation is legible: each act of giving away her wealth is dramatized as a step toward this metamorphosis.

Minor slip: the “texture of transformation” is named rather than fully dramatized in her body.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thorne’s watchful patience and quiet resolve are embodied in tactile micro-choices (aligning the quill holder by one final degree). Interior contradiction—duty vs rebellion—surfaces in the same gesture. The shared glance with Amara crystallizes a relationship shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    October’s contradictory impulse—yearning for impermanence yet forging permanent beauty—surfaces in the moonlit act of taping fragments; the final smile while touching the tin shows the cost of chosen illegibility.

Motivation is rooted in Marcus’s recognition and the anthology’s stakes, not abstract anarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marion’s contradictory impulses—stoic endurance vs. creative hope—are embodied in her micro-choices (studying reels, improvising chords).

Minor slip: “empirically whimsical” leans label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kenji’s grief and restraint are embodied in every micro-choice—his fingers on lace, the pause before speaking, the withheld apology—yet the student remains a sketch, diluting relational crucible pressure.
