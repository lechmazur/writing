  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's scientific detachment creates a consistent, believable perspective that drives her methodical collection of butterfly dust as flood evidence. Her motivation to "strip needless drama from the story" manifests through concrete micro-choices (collecting samples, measuring spectral shifts) with visible cost in her suppressed humanity. The moment with the peacock-blue scale on her wrist shows contradictory impulses—professional distance versus "kindled humility"—acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to find meaning in stillness rather than revenge drives a coherent arc from trauma through quest to transformed purpose. The internal contradiction between fleeing/following and the final choice to create rather than pursue shows genuine complexity. However, the transformation to opening a studio for "quiet hours at dawn" feels slightly unearned given the intensity of the preceding journey.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to translate silence crystallizes through embodied action (striking forks, mapping thermal emotions) with clear internal stakes. The transformation from acoustic scientist to thermal composer earns its arc through concrete choices under pressure. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional processing ("grief in slow violet waves") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The undertaker's transformation from "inadvertently stubborn" refusal to accepting his role as eternal keeper shows clear motivation rooted in his connection to the dead, with embodied details like "hands trembled" and "salt on his lips." The final choice to accept tenure in exchange for perpetual calm carries visible cost—he becomes the drowned library's keeper, filing souls "under its proper star," though some emotional transitions (dream to conviction) feel slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to sustain her community under sanctions is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like the bell's "muted tremor" and her declaration "We eat tonight so we can think tomorrow." The transformation from food carrier to cultural preserver shows genuine character evolution through micro-choices (melting wax to seal the chronicle, removing felt from bell). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("eyes bright with distrust") rather than more specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pilgrim's motivation roots clearly in the past-life memory driving her search for "where unused love is stored before it rots the heart." Her micro-choices (offering the jade, matching breath, stepping through the wisteria door) reveal consistent character under pressure. The man functions effectively as mirror/catalyst, though his characterization remains thinner. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully through the "hairline fracture" that both aches and heals.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal journey from seeking to control time to accepting its fluid nature shows genuine transformation with embodied cost ("the halo fragment grew hot, burning through her shirt"). The contradiction between her role as maze designer (imposing order) and her dissolution into the garden's system creates authentic tension. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("retrocognitively trapped") rather than fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to preserve heritage seeds for future generations is clear and drives every action, with internal conflict between immediate danger and long-term mission embodied through concrete choices. The transformation from captive to liberator is earned through patient strategy, though some moments of interiority rely on abstract phrasing ("staggering in its grace") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to collect and understand absence is grounded in the specific loss of her brother, with embodied emotion through physical interaction with the forge. The revelation of her own complicity ("the instant she had chosen doubt over belief") adds contradictory internal tension, though some moments edge toward abstract contemplation rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thief's motivation evolves from curiosity to compassion through concrete micro-choices, particularly her decision to restore rather than steal at the climax. Internal contradiction plays out in her hesitation about "thinning the fabric of someone else's tomorrow," though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal journey from grief-frozen isolation to thawing openness is well-embodied through concrete actions (breaking furniture for fuel, crafting the dome) and her dramatic narration device. The final choice to leave the dome behind rather than flee with it shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around grief ("fault lines of sorrow").

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo's phobia-driven contradictions (flinching at shadows yet leaping off buildings) create authentic tension, and his final choice to leak vulnerable footage carries visible career cost. The child character feels more symbolic than pressurized, but Leo's micro-choices under fear—placing the shell on the projector while guards approach—reveal values through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle's obsessive cartography of silence and her final transformation of the fort into navigable text demonstrate strong internal contradiction acted in scene. Her choice to preserve rather than flee carries visible cost—the erasure of names and physical reality. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "endless night" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    J4N-17's evolution from programmed function to consciousness-seeking entity is well-traced through the loops, with clear internal contradiction between its janitorial purpose and emergent curiosity.

Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("cold burning sensation") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal conflict between duty and reconciliation drives genuine choices with visible cost. The shift from "quiet night registrar" to active truth-seeker feels earned through concrete pressures. Minor deduction for Rico and Jun's somewhat convenient emotional openness at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal journey from believing she controls the garden to understanding their mutual dance creates genuine character arc with visible cost (her 0.03% luck day yields the impossible apple). The withered hands polishing cracked marbles while coaxing perfect blooms embodies contradiction effectively, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("ancient negotiation") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction between wanting to prove sideways time (escape her choice) versus accepting her mechanical symbiosis plays out through embodied details like the "mechanically warm" lungs breathing "with her instead of for her." The final choice to remain the "obliging sky mechanic" shows earned acceptance with visible cost - she sees alternate lives but chooses this chrysalis state.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The musician's motivation to explore the flooded opera house and connect with the ghost is clear and rooted in his liminal existence as a pit musician. His final choice to embrace the "spaces between" feels earned through the journey, though some interior moments lean toward abstraction ("between being heard and being invisible"). The ghost's characterization works primarily as catalyst rather than full character.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oracle's internal contradiction between swallowing truth to protect and needing to expel it drives authentic pressure through embodied sensation ("rootlet pierce her diaphragm"). The final renunciation of the truth-stone earns its cost through prior accumulation of weight metaphors. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("auroral sorrow") that briefly distances from embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jules's internal conflict between skepticism and the compulsion to pursue truth drives credible choices throughout, with embodied fear (trembling flashlight) and physical transformation (bead-shaped burns). The protagonist's recklessness compels entry into dangerous spaces while skepticism creates authentic resistance to supernatural explanations. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("gauzy consciousness") but the final internalization of the workers' weight creates genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicle keeper's internal contradiction between duty and dissolution is embodied through concrete actions like pressing against obsidian for anchor and the loosening grip on reality that becomes mercy. The final choice to eventually dissolve into stone carries visible cost—the erasure of witness itself. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "regenerative silence" that could be more physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like pressing the curl to her wrist for steadying memory. The internal need to preserve wonder drives consistent choices, though some moments slip into mild abstraction ("ordinary magic" as concept rather than felt experience).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian's sensitivity to "narratives trapped in stone" and her methodical discovery process create consistent motivation. Her final transformation—becoming "the displaced axis she sought"—is earned through accumulated revelations, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("bronze quiet replacing the hollow where longing had been").

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Chen's internal conflict between spy/sage identities drives meaningful choices, particularly his decision to orchestrate his own disappearance. The "accidentally prophetic" fortune writing creates genuine tension between intention and effect. His final renunciation of both roles for something unnamed carries visible cost ("felt the rocky island slide inside him").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The priest's internal contradiction between faith and doubt manifests concretely through his loop pedal actions, with his final choice to switch off creating genuine cost. The woman's minimal but precise actions (painting the cross, speaking once) reveal character through restraint. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around possession that lacks full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to map memories and conduct symphonies is clear and consistent, with embodied exhaustion and physical degradation driving urgency. The internal conflict between chronological homesickness and the need to complete the composition works well. However, the character remains somewhat abstract—we get poetic action but limited concrete personality beyond her role as fortune-writer/conductor, and the emotional stakes feel more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with embodied perception ("rainwater bead and fall upward," "wounds leak hours instead of blood") and meaningful internal conflict between versions of self. The confrontation with elder-Kael crystallizes choice with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("maze of versions") and the final boy-in-room image lacking sufficient embodied detail to fully land the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's grief journey from numbness to feeling is earned through concrete embodied moments—vibrations through bones, tears gathering "silver as tin." The contradictory impulses (seeking sound she cannot hear, wanting raw pain over numbness) create authentic complexity. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "filament of hush" metaphor that occasionally drifts from embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's meticulous nature and credible curiosity drive meaningful choices throughout, from waiting to watch the pigeon to choosing lateral movement over expected paths. Her decision to create a "lateral chain of integrity" shows internal conflict between official duty and truth, with visible cost in going underground. The "Ice traced her spine" moment effectively embodies fear, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("if she was being used as a conduit...").

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's grief-driven motivation is consistently embodied through sensory caution and physical restraint, with the contradiction between his professional role (selling light) and personal need (preserving darkness/scent) creating authentic internal conflict. The final transformation from lantern broker to "broker of invisible gardens" represents earned character change with visible cost—abandoning his livelihood to help others grieve.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's choice to walk between physical and transcendent existence is well-motivated through concrete details like Marcus's rope and Mrs. Chen's abandoned garden. Internal contradiction plays out effectively through simultaneous impulses toward transformation and preservation. The final choice to embrace "the weight of choice itself" lands with visible cost, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("texture of time") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to transform silence into incomplete music is grounded in her acoustic sensitivity and grandmother's legacy, with concrete embodied details like the violin "wobbling on purpose." The choice to leave the bowl humming in the dirt shows genuine renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "beauty in the unfinished" that edges toward thesis-speak rather than remaining fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's transformation from emotional dealer to empathic being is earned through concrete sensory experience. The contradictory impulses between her professional detachment and need "to feel something real" act simultaneously in scene. Her final acceptance of hurt as "proof she was still reachable" shows meaningful change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marisol's internal contradiction between public shrewdness and private compassion drives concrete choices throughout, particularly in the disguised fee waivers and the locket exchange. The final choice to give away her mother's photo shows meaningful character cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("cyclical ledger of kindness") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's progression from solitary artist to community weaver is earned through concrete actions—guiding searches, teaching reed-weaving, responding to Emil's silent gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation to complete her mother's interrupted cadence drives concrete choices throughout, with embodied grief shown through the pendant's warmth and her walking against impossible flow. The final choice to sacrifice future minutes for memory shows clear internal conflict acting in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unfinished musical phrase" and "internal ledger" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to solve grief through mathematical precision is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied details like "recited primes under my breath, 2, 3, 5, 7" showing internal conflict. The final choice to move forward "gently inventive" despite ambiguous loss shows earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotion as "locus of possible intersections" that briefly slips into conceptual language rather than staying fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's methodical nature and three-year habitation create consistent motivation for his fragment-collecting mission, with internal contradiction between isolation and connection needs. The girl's characterization arrives late but her silent reading and tears at Lorca establish genuine emotional stakes. Minor deduction for the girl remaining more vessel than character, though her final "I see you" lands with earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction between scientific control and fearful recognition of nature's unknowability drives authentic tension through embodied moments like "hands shook as she clipped a single specimen." The transformation sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("wasn't beautiful or gentle; it was the brutal honesty"), though some passages drift toward abstract emotional summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's insomnia functions as both literal condition and metaphor for necessary vigilance, with her exhaustion embodied through "raw eyes" and physical details. The exchange with the old woman reveals layered motivations beyond surface barter, and Mara's final transformation from burden to gift shows earned change through concrete experience. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient emotional resolution in the final line after months of insomnia.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pilgrim's transformation from seeker to carrier of magnified perception is earned through concrete cost—the clairvoyant's sacrifice of her gift. The parallel devolution of the seer into "mineral song" while he gains her sight creates genuine stakes. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("steadily unpredictable rhythm") that could be more embodied, though the treble clef scar and physical dissolution of the pearl ground the change effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to compile fragments despite exile is clear and deepens through concrete choices (seeking the trumpet parts, negotiating with the woman). The internal conflict between institutional duty and personal reckoning plays out through embodied actions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("reactively visionary") that lacks immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alden's internal journey from obsessive control to authentic confession is earned through embodied particulars—the punch "ticking with a pulse," memories "fluttering out" as physical holes. The contradictory impulses between mapping escape routes and confronting truth act simultaneously throughout, culminating in a costly choice to paint rather than map.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's transformation from "sympathetic skeptic" to one who trusts shared centuries is earned through embodied reactions to the tile's memories. The internal contradiction between her archaeological duty and her grief-driven need for proof creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "continued becoming" that slightly weakens the otherwise strong character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vey's immortal boredom drives genuine choices, particularly the bargain to help the technicians in exchange for reaching the door. The final choice between remembering and proceeding lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("centuries cracking like ice") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassidy's motivation is clear and rooted in grief-driven purpose, with concrete internal stakes around trading her last meaningful memory. The moment where she loses the lullaby melody creates genuine cost. Minor deduction for Julian remaining somewhat stock as the con artist father figure, and Rurik's transformation could use more embodied specificity during the ink's effect.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurelia's motivation to forge histories that help people cope drives consistent choices throughout, with internal complexity shown through her "earnestly studious" pursuit conflicting with awareness she "exhausts the world's longing." The final choice to continue despite knowing the cost ("heart heavier by one truth") earns the closure through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to reconstruct identity through collected fragments is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (pocketing shards, taping fragments to chest). The internal contradiction between accepting death and desperately gathering stories creates genuine tension. Micro-choices reveal values through specific actions like swallowing sentences "like communion," though some interiority edges toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen's internal contradiction between skepticism and hope drives genuine choices throughout, particularly in his interaction with the cello and seashell. The final choice to leave the cello "deliberately unvarnished" represents earned wisdom about truth's porosity, with visible cost in abandoning his certainty. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("gloomy cheerfulness") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina's dual allegiance creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through her graffiti encoding and story-translating role. The foundation stone chip functions as embodied attachment throughout. Minor deduction for the resistance assembly feeling slightly coordinated rather than chaotic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inspector's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like touching her grandmother's tooth-marked camera and the cracking voice on "intervention." Her purposeful curiosity manifests in concrete micro-choices: grinding the sand grain, timing the chemical reactions, waiting past the first blush to capture the final possible second. Internal contradiction operates effectively between professional documentation ("Species Anemone selenensis, final observation") and personal grief.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation and blindness create genuine constraints that shape her methods throughout. The drone's "Morse of fear" and Lira teaching it to "translate terror into torque" show sophisticated character-object parallel. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated moments like "magnetic calm" being stated rather than purely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's dry wit and subtle confidence manifest through concrete choices (not answering the Registry, choosing to descend, tearing the map page), with contradictory impulses between her cataloger's instinct and need to witness. The falcon's death and Maren's smile create genuine emotional complexity. Minor deduction for some interiority that leans abstract ("editor's instinct to annotate") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation through loss (his broken bell) and patient dedication drives meaningful choices, particularly his self-sacrifice at closure. The transformation from physical tuner to "tenth bell" shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("hollow inside his chest") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation to survive and map resonance is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tightening the copper coil and uncorking the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's journey from inherited shame to self-determination reads through concrete embodied choices (touching the lattice, speaking to walls, playing the pipe). The forgiveness declaration "I forgive the silence, but I will not become it" crystallizes internal contradiction effectively, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the echo is a cell with no door"). Minor deduction for occasional therapy-speak but the closure choice lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost bride's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—teaching the boy to die before the tumor blooms—with her debt driving escalating choices from ephemeral appearances to physical intervention. The boy's transformation from passive greenhouse laborer to active participant in his own salvation shows earned change through dramatized beats. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "debt" in early passages before it gains specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Calyx's motivation emerges clearly through embodied details like "threads of kelp knotted through his loom" and the blood sacrifice that makes orchids bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to rebuild faith through physical reconstruction is embodied in concrete actions (kneeling, cleaning bones, teaching hymns). Her internal conflict between exile and return manifests through specific choices like sleeping in the tomb and teaching the caretaker. The final choice to remain and guide other "interrupted journeys" carries visible cost—forsaking further travel for rootedness.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between maintaining pseudonyms versus revealing her true self drives credible choices throughout, with embodied details like "feeling the heartbeat beneath the wood." The final decision to keep the confession and send the unsigned letter shows meaningful agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The embroiderer's contradictory impulses—preserving truth while performing foolishness—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in her humming children's songs that name assassination targets. Her final choice to begin a new chart after preventing the coup demonstrates earned character continuity with visible cost (the risk she continues to bear).

    Strong internal conflict between guilt and the need for forgiveness drives meaningful choices, with the brother relationship as effective crucible. The protagonist's journey from carrying unsent letters to empty pockets shows earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's internal conflict between professional duty and human connection drives authentic choices, particularly in the act of "unknotting" the cast's messages despite the anesthetic blur. The child character applies immediate pressure through his "shrapnel-eyed" presence and directive to decode before "the dark eats the words."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal transformation from methodical certainty to embracing curiosity is earned through concrete magical-realist events, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (frustration with stones, attraction to the nickel).

Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the middle third ("curiosity the way lungs need air") that briefly shifts from embodied to conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arlo's motivation to preserve defiance is embodied through concrete actions (planting seeds, evading Inspector Voss) with clear stakes. His charming scholar persona manifests in specific tactics—reciting Lucretius as both deflection and activation code. The internal tension between compliance ("making sure none escape untaxed") and rebellion drives authentic micro-choices, though some interiority leans toward explanatory rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zale's centuries of insomnia creates a compelling internal contradiction between exhaustion and purpose, with the final choice to sleep reading as genuine renunciation with visible cost. The transition from "hollowing blade" exhaustion to accepting sleep as "alliance" shows earned character change. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("centuries of longing condensed into dew") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's systematic sacrifice of memories for each name creates genuine internal conflict with embodied cost. The foxglove heart metaphor and glass-orchid imagery provide consistent character-specific perception.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around internal states ("tasting ash") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with Mireya feeling the "faint heartbeat of magma" and concrete micro-choices under pressure. The shift from expected confrontation to collaboration with Corin shows meaningful character evolution. Minor deduction for Corin's somewhat abrupt trust shift lacking intermediate beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mirela's transformation from smuggler to archivist is earned through concrete micro-choices (hiding the meteorite, building the loft, creating micro-sheet melodies), with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—preservation versus erasure, trust versus hiding. The final renunciation (folding herself into dawn's release) carries visible cost. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("learning to trust again across learning to trust again") that briefly undermines the embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Juniper's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail—barefoot reading of floorboards, pressing the logbook to her chest—with internal contradictions acting simultaneously (searching for father's message while knowing he's gone).

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The astrologer's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the feather's "residual warmth," breathing into moon-pipes, muscle memory of belonging—creating genuine interiority. The ghost functions less as a character than as catalyst, but the protagonist's transformation from observer to participant in ritual earns its cost through concrete gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's sacrifice of personal memory for collective preservation creates genuine internal conflict, though the revelation arrives late. Her final choice between remembering and preserving shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost. The emotional progression from discovery to acceptance feels earned but relies heavily on conceptual rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cass's motivation to "serenade monotony with creativity" drives consistent, specific choices throughout, with her orchestrated manipulation showing clear internal logic. The boy's wonder and the crowd's reaction demonstrate effective secondary characterization. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract framing of her motivation rather than more visceral personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysira's motivation to preserve forbidden memory through embodied art is clear and compelling, with internal contradiction between exile's emptiness and her body's persistent rhythm. The transformation from dancer to living verse shows earned change through specific physical cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional states ("absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's characterization succeeds through concrete particulars (ankle-deep stance, reading water patterns) and embodied ritual. Her transformation from private communion to public healing shows genuine agency. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "noctilucent reckonings" and "debts of beauty" that edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between guilt and the need to speak is embodied through concrete actions (swallowing ash, crying, drawing the spiral). The transformation from silence to commissioning feels earned through the dramatized ritual, though some emotional transitions rely on abstract language ("hard softness") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details ("equations tangled in her hair," "pricked her finger") and internal contradictions (logical dreamer needing hope). The final choice to "walk into the returning tide" demonstrates earned agency with visible cost—leaving behind the grotto she's revitalized. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's transformation from cartographer to corridor/echo fusion is earned through discovery of her lineage and the building's photographic nature, with visible cost as she loses physical form. The "sensitively perceptive" trait drives her ability to hear older frequencies and track the echo to its source.

    The painter's transformation from creating "beautiful lies" to becoming "a mirror herself, reflecting possibilities" shows genuine character evolution with embodied emotion (dancing, singing). The borrowed heartbeat functions as a concrete physical manifestation of internal conflict. Minor deductions for some abstract phrasing around "possibility itself" and the incomplete final sentence that weakens closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The negotiator carries genuine weight through accumulated loss and responsibility, with her internal conflict between hope and exhaustion embodied in concrete details like the scarred clipboard and the list of the dead. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("beauty flawed by responsibility") rather than embodied perception, and the collective delegates lack individual distinction despite their presence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The philanthropist's contradictory nature—weeping for what he destroys—creates genuine internal tension throughout. His motivation coheres perfectly: preservation through destruction, sentiment hidden beneath amorality. The final renunciation (walking away after releasing the ghost birds) carries visible emotional cost in "salt tears mixing with mineral crust."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lys's transformation from contracted courtesan to "first voice that refused to echo" tracks clearly with embodied contradiction ("pulse feel like betrayal"). The choice to remain rather than escape with the weaver demonstrates earned agency. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("freedom, too, can be a terrifying lullaby") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lucien's transformation from refusing to letter protest slogans to embracing "questions rather than answers" demonstrates clear character evolution with visible cost (lost patronage, gallery quarrel). However, the epiphany about "ethical storytelling" arrives too neatly through the magical realism device rather than through embodied struggle, and his internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories through ephemeral memorials is consistent and drives every choice, particularly the decision to release the structure to the butterflies. The internal conflict between preservation and dissolution plays out through concrete actions (knotting wire, watching it dissolve). Minor deduction for the grandmother's wisdom arriving as convenient backstory rather than discovered through present struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's transformation from bell-caster who destroyed an organ to one who preserves forgotten names through sound shows clear motivation with embodied emotion ("tears freezing into delicate lenses that cracked when I smiled"). The forgiveness moment anchors the change credibly, though the internal conflict could act more simultaneously in scene rather than through reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Foresight Hindsight Only's paradoxical temporality ("born without a future or a past, only the instant between them") creates genuine internal contradiction that drives her final dissolution into the storm. The character's transformation from seeker to medium shows earned change with visible cost as she literally dissolves ("Lightning unthreads her name"). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("knows the bunker is negotiating its own escape") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Naram-bel's motivation is clear and rooted in his frugal devotion to mathematics over empire, with the magic square purchase demonstrating seven years of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with Lira's scheme evolving from manipulation to self-confrontation when the shadow-double forces her to metabolize her own unopened anger.

Minor deduction for the shadow-Lira's slightly abrupt emergence without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mirror maker's internal conflict between capturing and releasing dreams drives genuine change with visible cost. His renunciation is earned through the dream's revelation about his self-imposed boundaries. Minor deduction for the dream "speaking" feeling slightly convenient, though the embodied transformation compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mender's contradictory impulses act through concrete choices—barring elders despite needing funds, using sacred items for practical grafting. The daughter relationship crystallizes values through the ribbon's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal contradictions manifest beautifully through "excitement sharpened by dread, like sunlight on a scalpel" and her bathroom-revelation history creates genuine depth.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to steal unlearned lessons to prevent war is clear and compelling, with concrete micro-choices like trading her future year for the time traveler's life.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassia's quest driven by tangible motivation (green dreams bleeding from emerald card) with embodied reactions throughout. The chimera's tri-form nature and Cassia's fracturing identity create genuine internal contradiction acted in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("becoming more herself by becoming less certain") that edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to comprehend rather than possess drives genuine choices with embodied details like "fingers sensing temperature changes in the silk." The final palm-press authorizing return shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("confusion and clarity rotate like twin suns") that briefly distances from embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's motivation to preserve collective memory is consistent but remains largely observational without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her "preemptively nostalgic" trait manifests through action (tearing sleeve fabric, carrying borrowed memories) but lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization. The final descent erases her presence effectively, showing credible renunciation with mild cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Luma's motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" drives concrete actions through fire manipulation and chanting, with embodied details like "half sob, half fuse" revealing internal contradiction.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around hopelessness that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion through concrete details like "lantern trembling," "thumb brushing the cool stone wings."

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nilo's interiority is concrete and specific, with contradictory impulses operating through his actions—cultivating silence while inviting confession, monitoring decibels while teaching comfort. The commuter's fear ("I fear the day my child stops searching for me in crowded rooms") lands with earned emotional specificity at 26 decibels, and the transformation is credible. Minor deduction for the commuter remaining somewhat archetypal beyond the confession moment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lore keeper's motivation is clear and deepens from curiosity to accepting generational responsibility, with concrete embodied details like pressing her forehead against stone for neural interface.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shadow keeper's internal contradiction between teaching death while learning to live creates genuine complexity, with her suffocation practice embodying this tension. The boy's characterization as suffocating under excessive love provides a fresh angle on parental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation through debt trauma manifests in concrete embodied details (forehead to cold brass, 42 hertz frequency trigger), and her transformation from debtor to liberator tracks causally through specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin's motivation drives clearly from "dynasty ender" identity through discovery to self-erasure, with the wound/blood treaty providing embodied cost.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("purpose carved into marrow") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sir Calen's internal journey from withdrawal to opening is earned through concrete transformations—the puppet revealing his younger self, the moth carrying fortress blueprints, mercury roots rewriting his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's transformation from mechanical certainty to embracing uncertainty is well-motivated through concrete discoveries and embodied moments (wading into the chill pool, arms wide in the leaf spiral). The internal contradiction between his tinkerer's need for precision and his growing comfort with uncertainty plays out through actions, not labels. Minor deduction for some abstraction in later passages ("befriend uncertainty in planning") that edges toward thematic statement rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alder's motivation is rooted in grief and alchemical belief, with contradictory impulses (redeem/release) acting simultaneously in the crucible scene. The choice to release her name into the water system shows clear values hierarchy with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details—pressing the tooth to her lips as "habit older than her name" and her "modestly fearless heart ticking like a quiet metronome." The transformation of the giggle from spectral confession to "small sun learning how to shine without burning" behind her ribs shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for the child's appearance reading slightly convenient, but the core arc of collector integrating lost laughter lands with specificity.

    Corwin's motivation to "fill the empty spaces" in his "cracked chase" heart drives clear, escalating choices through stealing the whisper, operating the press, and ultimately walking the cloud-sea.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurelio's motivation as a defunct revolutionary is clear and consistent, with his poetic sensibility driving meaningful micro-choices (scratching the mirror, giving Mira the shard).

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ivy's motivation as a collector of "beginnings" drives consistent choices through psychometry and deliberate descent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)

The daughter relationship provides subtle pressure that forces the final choice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria") but the cost of her sacrifice lands viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied loneliness through the hollow echo and metallic taste metaphors, with the boy's "shoulders softened" showing physical release. The knock-knock joke exchange crystallizes their mutual recognition effectively. Minor deduction for the boy's somewhat abrupt transformation from mystical conductor to vulnerable kid.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blind mapmaker's journey from mapping external territories to confronting his unmapped interior shows genuine transformation with visible cost. His internal contradiction between professional mastery and personal avoidance plays out through embodied sensation (citrus frequencies, warm ink through pores). The final choice to become "parchment and ink and reader all at once" pays off his earlier fear of touching his own blank interior.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction between confidence and uncertainty drives genuine choices throughout, particularly in her decision to edit the filaments despite knowing each change propagates echoes. The embodied emotion of the pen vibrating and gravity tugging at her bones avoids stock interiority. Her final acceptance of "confident in its gentle uncertainty" represents earned character growth through specific struggle, though some moments edge toward abstract philosophizing rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion through concrete gestures (palm on splintered wood, conducting movements) and the contradictory impulse of carrying an empty camera "because it weighed the same as memory." The final choice to embrace silence as music shows earned transformation, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("forgotten parts of herself rise like tide").

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ember's pyromania-as-preservation motivation is conceptually interesting but lacks embodied emotional contradiction in scene. The grandmother relationship provides clear stakes, yet the protagonist's internal conflict resolves too neatly into epiphany ("her arson had never been about destruction but about revelation") without dramatized struggle. The final transformation from destroyer to keeper happens through exposition rather than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal conflict between grief and hope manifests through embodied action (drumming as communication) with genuine contradictory impulses. The choice to dissolve into unity carries visible cost—her physical form dispersing into light. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("half-life," "soul stretched thin") that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Both characters have clear motivations rooted in inheritance and professional expertise, with Mira's seven years of experience contrasting effectively against the academic visitor's unfamiliarity. The discovery moment earns its resonance through accumulated detail about whisper acoustics and wartime history. Minor deduction for the visitor's somewhat convenient arrival timing and Mira's quick trust of a stranger in restricted areas.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's transformation from darkness to silent teacher is earned through specific embodied details (mouthless face, gloved hands warming the mirror). Internal contradiction manifests concretely as she holds both the half-spoken secret and enforced silence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "spiralingly calm presence" that reads more as label than embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's ability to hear unspoken words drives concrete choices throughout, particularly her recognition of Ellis's handwriting and her response to the magnetic grotto. The collective cast who arrive barefoot carrying saplings shows earned transformation through specific dramatized moments. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in collective motivation ("forests of second thoughts") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's transformation from dutiful dock worker to freedom-seeker is earned through concrete details like her "calloused palms" and the way she "heaved crates with the same grace she once used to dance." The internal contradiction between duty and motion plays out through embodied choices, particularly when she builds the raft while "humming the whale's descending scale." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "true nature" in later beats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The performer's moral ambiguity—reporting neighbors then forging joy coupons—creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices. Her cultivation of "lightness in grief" through ritualistic narration shows embodied coping under the happiness mandate's aftermath. The crow's speaking moment strains credibility but the performer's response through whittling reveals character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cloud-shadow poet demonstrates clear motivation through her linguistic rebellion and transformation of law through poetry, with internal consistency as she moves from banned recusant to boundary-dissolver. Her agency drives every beat through deliberate choices (pressing palm to quartz, speaking into lattice, stepping onto dissolving ice), though some emotional specificity gets lost in the abstract lyrical mode. The transformation from law-breaker to law-rewriter is earned through concrete actions with visible cost (risking re-freezing as "statue of precedent").

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Milo's colorblindness driving his desperate search for impossible hues creates genuine motivation, and his acceptance of fractured beauty over perfection marks earned change. The contradiction between his inability to see color and his painter identity generates authentic tension. Minor deduction for Rosa's relatively thin characterization beyond her role as catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell ringer's transformation from collector to creator shows clear internal progression with embodied details ("pockets clinking with fragments"). Her questioning stance drives meaningful change, though some collective character movements lack individual specificity ("collectors began to dismantle their equipment").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mourning jewelry maker's grief-driven transformation is well-motivated, with concrete embodied details like "her fingers tracing the edge of a tattoo stencil." Her internal contradiction between preserving and accepting loss drives meaningful choices, particularly in the shift from "genuinely artificial" memorials to allowing transformation. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional summary ("subdued ardor manifested") rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation to "map cultural patterns" and "understand what had really happened to the world's story" is consistent and drives her ritual. Her internal experience is concrete through physical details (ink-stained fingers, barefoot walking) rather than abstract emotion. The final descent with "pockets empty of coin but full of measured silence" shows earned endurance with visible cost, though some moments lean toward over-articulation ("reverse engineer the culture itself").

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The historian's transformation from isolated seeker to communal teacher shows consistent motivation through embodied details like "fingers traced symbols" and "sweat absorbed by saffron veil." Her final choice to share memory's burden rather than purify it alone emerges naturally from accumulated pressure. Internal contradiction between preservation and erasure drives authentic tension, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("atoms of nostalgia clustered around her throat").

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's contradictory impulses between preservation and release act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she considers dropping the stone through clouds but instead absorbs it. The final choice to vanish into her own archive is earned through prior causality, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("shadow unbound") that resists embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miren's internal contradiction between her shattered faith and continuing compassion drives authentic choices throughout. The specific embodied details (feeling the chameleon's minute heartbeat, hair falling loose with fog) ground her emotional state. Her motivation to "balance self-reckoning and compassion" manifests through concrete actions rather than declaration, though some passages drift toward overly articulate self-awareness ("the fraud she had unwittingly protected").

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("tasting iron and lilac," blood as syllables). The protagonist's motivation to release the miracle by reopening wounds shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("to seek closure") early on, though the embodied complexity at closure compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal loss, driving her to seek the lost lyrics through psychometry. Her internal conflict between hope and uncertainty manifests through embodied details like "fingertips tingled" and the physical act of scratching new lyrics onto film. The transformation from passive seeker to active projector of love is earned through accumulated discoveries, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dreamer's motivation crystallizes through embodied struggle—dragging the telescope, dismantling it piece by piece, finally dissolving into stardust. Her internal conflict between preserving creativity and surrendering to cosmic forces plays out through concrete actions, particularly in the dismantling sequence where each removed part clarifies the "unspoken words."

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guard's motivation emerges through consistent traits—his ritual winding of a frozen clock, speaking children's names as protective charms, and methodical completion of impossible duties. His final choice to plant the clock and step back after "job finished" shows earned renunciation with visible cost: the children transformed to pollen-light beings who must carry sparks forward without him. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("divergent archive of all the hours that would never come again") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The philosopher's motivation to "rediscover the wild frontier of your mind" drives consistent choices through translocation, gear sacrifice, and final transformation. Internal conflict between holding certainty (the gear) and embracing distribution manifests concretely in the jaguar encounter. The transformation into a tree that teaches others is earned through prior losses and the established pattern of consciousness fragmenting across locations.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characters pursue clear goals (finding the hound, restoring balance) with embodied stress and consistent traits. The hound's internal crisis mirrors human travelers' struggles effectively. However, emotional progression feels somewhat abstract ("unused courage waits") and lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, particularly during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bellhop's motivation is grounded in personal loss (mother's lullaby), and his internal contradiction between preserving safety and mourning voice is embodied through the piano bolt ritual. The boy-bellhop parallel creates effective doubling. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("frostbitten hope crystallizing") that occasionally replaces concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The titan's motivation is crystalline—restoring cosmic balance through precision rather than revenge—and his regally unpretentious nature manifests through concrete actions like leaving cryptic marginalia. The pretender's character arc from entitled sovereign to exposed stranger lands with psychological specificity. Minor deduction for the titan's emotional flatness; he remains instrumentally focused without internal contradiction or cost weighing his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as witness, with embodied reactions like "the delayed revelation stir like an eel waking in her chest."

Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("genocide with photographs") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stargazer's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete actions (climbing the crane, activating the shuttle), with her "awkward confidence" embodied through physical choices rather than labels. Internal conflict between witnessing/acting resolves through the stone circle's call, though the transformation from passive observer to active catalyst could use more intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nara's motivation to subvert genetic control is clear and consistent, with internal contradictions embodied through her telepathic plant connection versus her insurgent goals. The final choice to alter the embryo carries visible cost (risking capture, physical pain from aging knees). Minor deduction for the guard's too-convenient soporific response lacking sufficient setup.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator's motivation crystalizes through embodied grief ("mapping [plants] against hollow places in my body") and contradictory impulses between fleeing and dissecting memory for mercy.

    Elian's grief-driven obsession and artistic desperation create consistent motivation throughout, with concrete embodied details like "feeling it pulse like a dying heart" and the tactile interaction with tarot fragments. The final choice to step through the mirror into dissolution is earned through accumulated loss, though some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing ("Is absence the purest pigment"). Internal contradiction acts simultaneously in his desperate search versus acceptance of destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's progression from "serene anger" to "acceptance of the desert's logic" drives genuine transformation with visible cost—the conscious choice to vanish like his family. Internal contradictions manifest through his simultaneous determination to find Lyra and growing understanding that disappearance might be necessary. The albino trait functions beyond decoration, with pink eyes and moonlight-glowing skin marking him as already liminal.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sera's internal conflict between duty and conscience drives genuine tension through embodied reactions ("pulse drummed louder than the ventilation fans") and culminates in a costly choice with clear stakes. The "bravely conflicted" attribute manifests through concrete actions rather than labels, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("archivist and anarchist fused").

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's cool-headed composure creates consistent pressure through her refusal to quicken pulse, and her final understanding that "divinity is not a catch but a conversation" lands with earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cordelia's motivation to break her orbit of regret is clear and embodied through the splintered rosewood nib.

    The tattooist's guilt over the child's death drives consistent, embodied choices through amber-tethering and console interaction, with contradictory impulses (restore vs. erase) acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—choosing release over becoming the lullaby—earns closure through prior causality with visible cost (the static softening to meteor hush). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("dissonance of old guilt") rather than fully embodied emotion in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal journey from seeking meaning to understanding it as "motion to repeat" shows genuine transformation with visible cost (destroying her mandala).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost's motivation to seek "possibility" through applause is clear and consistent, with embodied longing (pressing coin to where heart once beat) and a credible final transformation where he gains substance through accumulated echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's internal progression from skepticism to acceptance drives meaningful change, with contradictory impulses (scientific rationality vs. undeniable telepathic evidence) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to illuminate connections rather than resist shows earned transformation with visible cost. However, secondary characters remain somewhat functional despite their revealed inner states, and Maya's "affectionate skepticism" feels more labeled than embodied through specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aera's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (collecting thermal glyphs, pressing fossil to sternum), with contradictory impulses shown in scene when she collapses yet rises "lighter by the mass of one fear."

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)

    The spy's internal conflict between past paralysis and "prudently daring" action drives credible choices, with embodied details like "scarred nerves" and the bleeding knee showing cost.

    The coachman's transformation from ferryman to story-carrier shows genuine internal progression through embodied details like "raw-knuckled hands" and the physical act of threading memories.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied characterization through Mara's careful actions with the lockmaster's tooth and her patient teaching of the boy. The "wistfully pragmatic" trait manifests concretely in her law-breaking for a higher purpose. Minor deduction for the boy remaining somewhat abstract despite his pivotal role.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quagga's journey from remembering human life to achieving solitary transcendence shows clear motivation rooted in the tension between isolation and independence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to preserve sparks of the dead builds consistently through concrete details like "three hundred and forty-two corpses" whose patterns she harvests.

    Mira's internal contradiction between protecting her sanctuary and accepting the seed's transformative demand creates genuine tension. The shift from controller to co-creator with the building shows earned change through concrete action.

    Ellery's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions with the leaf blower, and his internal contradiction between hope and despair acts simultaneously in the tunnel scene.

    The interpreter's progression from assumption-bound technician to cosmic translator is earned through concrete sensory experiences (tingling fingertips mapping constellations, tears at recognition). Her choice to discard assumptions like "sailors ditch ballast" drives the closure with visible cost—the sequin's sublimation. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("every finale as merely the fold where the tape loops") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arden's motivation to anchor the ferry and save the phantom passengers drives credible choices throughout, with his "resiliently positive" trait manifesting in concrete actions like the twice-flipped hourglass and radio broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist exists more as a conceptual vessel than a character with genuine internal conflict or embodied emotion. The composite man offers brief relational pressure, but dissolves before creating meaningful character-based choice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The instructor's internal conflict between grief for the lost surface and duty to teach creates genuine tension, particularly in her moment with the trembling boy.

However, the boy character lacks sufficient development for their relationship to fully earn its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization with Mira's specific gift and genuine internal conflict between duty and connection. The motivation is clear and rooted in her "persistently curious nature," with embodied emotion through the hearing aid's pulses.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's contradictory impulses—refusing death while existing as a digital ghost—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in the tension between remaining disembodied versus returning to flesh. The final choice to give the clerk "midnight solace" is earned through prior causality with visible cost (leaving his liminal existence).

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carpenter's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking meaning in silence drives him to the train and shapes his interaction with the halo fragment. His transformation from skeptic to believer occurs through embodied discovery (horses neighing in marrow, throat aching with swallowed words).

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The investigator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (measuring, documenting, adapting escape routes).

The discovery of her mother's unsent letters creates a powerful emotional arc where internal conflict (fear of lost listening skills) drives meaningful action.

    Garnet's internal "cradle of sparks" metaphor for obedience turning to invention provides clear motivation, and her micro-choices (tracing angles, bridging terminals) reveal values under pressure.

    The thief's motivation is clear and complex, rooted in curiosity rather than greed. Her "quietly savvy" trait is demonstrated through concrete actions like reading the flower code and recognizing the ring's inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The negotiator's micro-choice to read the names of the dead is a powerful, character-specific action that reveals her hierarchy of values. The final choice to sign is earned by her prior causality and the weight of her failures. A slight deduction for the phrase "beauty flawed by responsibility," which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The philanthropist's contradictory impulses—amoral actions paired with secret sentimentality—are vividly embodied in his tears and ritual. His final choice to release the echo feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the irreversible drought and his emotional breakdown. Micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the map and digging with splitting nails, reveal a hierarchy of values. The closure choice is motivated and scales to the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lys's characterization is strong, with her chaste courtesan role and internal conflict between duty and defiance clearly driving the narrative. Her final choice to remain and sing feels earned by her prior actions. However, her internal state occasionally drifts into abstract description ("alarming serenity") rather than concrete, embodied emotion at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lucien’s internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly in the climactic choice to "letter with questions rather than answers." His final renunciation is earned by the puppet-show reversal of his life's narrative. A slight deduction for a minor over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("equations of regret") in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, specific worldview. Her micro-choices under pressure (knotting the wire, accepting the butterfly's claim) reveal her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted and contradictory, compelling higher-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)

A minor deduction for interiority that, while concrete, could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—her pacifist scheming and unprocessed anger—are dramatized in scene, particularly when her shadow double confronts her. Her final choice to metabolize her own resentment is earned by prior causality and carries a visible cost, as she accepts the "burn of every bomb" and the music box is broken beyond repair.

Her motivation to "steal them back for the world" sharpens compellingly under pressure, culminating in a final micro-choice to release the absences, which is earned by prior causality. The time traveler serves as a secondary pressure source, though his characterization is intentionally more functional.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassia's motivation is rooted in tangible, character-specific details (the emerald swatch, bleeding green dreams) and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict—becoming "more herself by becoming less certain who that was"—is a concrete, embodied contradiction that plays out in scene. The final renunciation, understanding the garden is a moment of release, is earned by the prior causality of her memory-weaving and carries a visible cost as her childhood "drop[s] away." The chimera acts as a crucible, her choices directly altering Cassia's tactics and knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation ("comprehension, not possession") is consistent and drives every action. Her "warmly methodical" trait is embodied in her careful work with the threads, sensing emotional hues, and her final choice to add her print to the seal.

    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, compelling high-stakes choices. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her tactile reading of ice and stone.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("its fracture edges warm as if remembering light"). The final choice to become the new prism is earned by prior causality and the mother's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist's motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" is clear and compelling, driving all on-page choices. Her micro-choices—measuring, accepting a memory, leaving a tribute—reveal a complex hierarchy of values. The final act of signing the spiral as a witness is a profound, earned renunciation. A slight deduction as the "preemptively nostalgic" trait is more a stated label than a flaw that actively complicates choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Luma's motivation is concrete and embodied, driving her to defy hopelessness through specific actions like igniting the rag.

A slight deduction for the keeper's trade feeling somewhat detached from her core motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nilo’s characterization is strong, defined by his ritualistic care for silence and his role as a teacher. His micro-choices, like easing the throttle to model comfort, reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)

    Interior contradiction is vividly embodied through the shadow keeper's practice of suffocation and her role as guide.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira's motivations are crystal clear and deeply rooted in her history, compelling her high-stakes choice to transmute her debt.

Her micro-choices under pressure (sorting seeds to calm herself, building monuments) reveal a consistent, embodied character.

    Liora's "quietly driven need" is a clear, consistent motive that intensifies under pressure, compelling her to sleep in the pavilion and ultimately reconfigure her art. Her internal conflict—dawn eluding her brushes, grief with "no outline"—is concrete and embodied, not diagnostic.

A slight deduction for the epiphany's phrasing leaning toward thematic statement rather than pure embodied perception at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireya's characterization is masterfully embodied through specific professional habits and visceral reactions to the lagoon's projections. Her final choice to broadcast the truth feels earned by prior micro-choices and the visible cost of years rearranging inside her.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her rejection of false comfort, compelling high-stakes choices like smashing the bottle. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in micro-choices like speaking prices aloud to anchor memory.

His "tranquilly perceptive" nature is embodied through specific, concrete observations that reveal character.

Minor deduction for the "ghosts leaned forward" beat, which slightly abstracts a collective emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character's motivation is clear and evolves from measurement to sensation exchange. Embodied emotion is strong, particularly with the urn fragment. Final renunciation of his former role is earned, though the trade feels slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The poet's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with micro-choices under pressure (tucking the feather, tearing his sleeve) revealing a hierarchy of values.

The only minor flaw is a slight convergence of voice with the woman at the peak emotional beat, though their internal voices remain distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mateo's motivation is deeply rooted in his mortality, compelling high-stakes choices.

    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, her academically rebellious nature driving her investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman's characterization is deeply realized through specific actions (crushing seed pods, understanding bird calls) and a consistent motivation to reclaim the battlefield through growth. His internal conflict between grief and hope is embodied in the "narrow vastness" trembling inside him, culminating in an earned emotional shift when he feels it widen at the end. The lone tern's ambiguous gift (button) complicates his mission without simplifying his moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Scraps and Kite are distinct and their motivations are clear, though Kite's characterization relies slightly on her brother's absence. Scraps's final transformation from retired tracker to "courier teaching distance how to kneel" is an earned, resonant reconfiguration. The brother's emergence feels slightly passive, but his final line effectively crystallizes the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his grief and guilt ("eyes ringed with the guilt of surviving") driving his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.4)
    Vespers' characterization is masterful through concrete actions (singing backwards to amuse wind, carving secret chess piece) and embodied contradictions (cautious abandon).

Halcyon's thawing lake eyes and fear of heights add depth without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the handling of the vial cork.

Her final realization—"she was not the navigator but the offering"—is earned by prior causality, a decisive change with visible cost as her seams loosen and she becomes the geography.

    Elias's characterization is strong with consistent motivation rooted in loneliness and a search for meaning. His final choice to renounce the doorway is earned by the vision of his future self, carrying a visible cost.

Contradictory impulses (forgiveness wrapped inside betrayal) act simultaneously in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lina's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, her terror and determination coexisting under pressure. Her final choice to speak her brother's name is earned by the crystallized breath and the rune's transformation, a decisive change with visible cost.

    Mira's characterization is rich with interior contradiction and embodied emotion, particularly in her trembling hands as she deciphers the final chime.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to teach is clear and rooted in her unique condition, compelling her final high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cael's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with his historically reverent nature and stone-skimming gift driving every choice. His final renunciation—becoming the echo—is earned by prior causality, with the arrowhead's merger into his sternum providing a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s internal contradiction (yearning for the unprogrammed vs. his exile) is concrete and embodied, particularly when he unstraps his apprentice bands.

The emotional progression from cynicism to wonder is credible and earned through specific on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jin's motivation to "discover the color of sound" is clear and consistent, compelling his high-stakes dive. His micro-choices (leaving the ladder, diving, playing the cylinder) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final realization that sound was waiting to paint him is an earned, character-specific epiphany. A slight deduction for a minor motivational convenience; his lifelong quest feels more declared than deeply conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, melancholic determination. Her quiet enthusiasm is a credible trait that enables her final choice, though her internal contradiction and emotional embodiment are occasionally abstracted by the high-concept prose.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The reaper's characterization is a masterclass in interiority and contradiction. His initial motivation (to name a fear) is rooted in a deep, character-specific flaw—the inability to see himself as worthy of sacrifice. This internal conflict is embodied under pressure, culminating in the earned, devastating realization that he is the recipient of countless sacrifices, which forces a decisive change in his stance and action (shattering the cylinders).

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael's characterization is consistent and deeply felt. His "earnestly naive" belief and "lukewarm" magic compel his choices, and his final endurance as "keeper of the drip" is earned by his prior actions and visible cost—his aging and death.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction is vividly embodied in the tension between logic and intuition, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final choice to dissolve the crystal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling and the transformed axis of her mind. The trait "secretly sentimental" is demonstrated through action (healing the starling with prime numbers) rather than told. A minor deduction for the slight abstraction in "rearranged in axis," which leans diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with interior contradiction embodied in the tension between duty and trust. The final choice to pass the buckle is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Mara and Zero embodying complementary contradictions that feel organic. Their final synthesis is earned through on-page emotional exchange, particularly Mara's decision to reach across the blade and share her heartbreak.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in her role as creator and guardian. Her "notably receptive" trait is embodied in her interaction with the seed and the levers, though this could be more physically detailed under peak stress. The final choice to guide the growth is earned by her established desire to safeguard innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    Ellery's grief is embodied and contradictory, his micro-choices (brushing the handle, gentler throttle) reveal a hierarchy of values. His final understanding is earned by prior causality, a renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The guardian’s transformation from a cataloguer of certainties to an entity befriending uncertainty is earned through concrete, embodied micro-choices (e.g., pressing her paw/hand against the frozen rose).

His final choice to merge timelines is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the hourglass's destruction.

Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on thematic labeling ("resiliently positive") in one instance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fever dream architect's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific, embodied desire to "discover the texture of connection." Her micro-choices under pressure (weaving, accelerating her work) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final realization that she "was the thread, the pattern, the space between" is an earned epiphany, though the cost of this transformation feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    The instructor's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (handling the chain link, choosing truth over a lie) revealing a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the mechanical heartbeat and digital ghost metaphor.

Minor deduction for slight diagnostic speak in "defragment myself."

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)

    Calla's micro-choices under pressure—her heart-rhythm signaling, playing the lullaby backward—are concrete, embodied, and reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation (leaving the seed) is earned by the causality of her musical tactics.

The final choice to deploy the memory virus is an earned, decisive change with visible cost, foreclosing his old role. Sal's presence as a secondary character applies immediate, relevant pressure, and their shared "respectfully rebellious" stance deepens the central conflict.

    Mireya's motivation is clear and fierce, rooted in a private, specific longing that compels her high-stakes choice to risk a memory. Her actions align with her desire to restore voices, and her final choice to step into the tide and photograph the dream is a credible endurance with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The locksmith’s enigmatic nature is a compelling trait, though his internal contradiction (bold stride vs. cosmic hush) is more stated than dramatized under pressure. His final choice—pressing his forehead to the trembling lips—is a powerful micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values, but the motivation feels slightly abstract, rooted more in archetype than specific, embodied flaw. The earned endurance and integration of the silver curl are strong, but the interiority leans toward the poetic rather than the concretely particular in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her "chronically curious" nature, compelling her high-stakes choice to reject the exchange.

The memory of her mother buttoning the raincoat is a micro-choice that tilts her present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's characterization is exceptional, with her contradictory impulses (combative tenderness, refusal to forget) acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)

His final choice to release the color rather than hoard it is a decisive, earned change that reconfigures his goal with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's methodical curiosity is a consistent, driving trait that compels her investigation and final choice to wait and listen.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)

    Lyra's motivation is clear, concrete, and intensifies under pressure, compelling her final choice to release rather than encode. Her internal conflict with the echo is a strong on-page dramatization of contradictory impulses. The final renunciation is earned, with a visible cost in the empty flower press. A slight deduction for the echo's voice not being distinctly separate from Lyra's own internal voice, slightly flattening the relationship-as-crucible dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira's warmly inquisitive nature is the engine of the plot, compelling her investigation and final choice to plant the seed.

The cost of the library's loss and her personal transformation is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara's characterization is exceptional, with embodied grief ("loosened grief slipping down her cheeks") and a credible micro-choice trajectory from scattering ashes to creating resonant sculptures. Her polymer chemist expertise isn't ornamental; it directly shapes her insight and final action. The final choice to create and distribute the sculptures is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her atonement for missing the final call.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vendor's core motivation ("to incise the day... map the negative space") is clear and intensifies, compelling her final self-sacrificial choice. Her internal contradiction is shown through her role as both merchant and architect of absence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireya's empathetically decisive trait is embodied through concrete micro-choices under pressure, such as selecting specific lexicons and persuading the cuckoo with Proto-Clockwork. Her internal conflict between feeling the tower's wheeze and the elevator's hunger drives higher-stakes actions, culminating in a credible renunciation of rest to weave a bridge of resonance. The final cost is felt in her exhaustion and the glittering metallic dust, though the interiority could show slightly more contradictory impulses during the peak repair beat.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's characterization is deeply specific and embodied, with her "chaotically precise" flaw driving the high-stakes calibration. Her motivation to become an "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is dramatized through her risky choice, and her final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by the prior causality of her connection to the canyon. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label in "synaptic plasticity gone feral," though it is quickly anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilyra's prism-minded perception and thirty-year pursuit are concrete and compelling, driving her choices under pressure.

The final choice to carry the song forward is earned by the tactile, micro-choice-driven process of mapping and playing the cracks. Motivation is simple and fierce, compelling higher-stakes action. The only minor hairline slip is a slight diagnostic flavor in "empathy in motion—that is her craft," but it is immediately anchored in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's jittery nature and deep yearning for his mentor are embodied and drive his micro-choices.

    Corin’s transformation from meek to defiant is earned through specific, embodied micro-choices: bartering his hammer, folding the silk into a mouse, cutting the cable, and reclaiming his tool-shape.

The cost of his resilience is felt in the slag-pile landing and the gong’s reverberation, scaling his agency to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)

Her final decision to "chart not places but consequences" is earned by the on-page revelation of her complicity.

His motivation to protect against forgetting is rooted in a seven-year history, and his final act of bottling the sea glass is a credible renunciation that carries a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied, particularly in the borrowed heart's acceleration at the name Elowen.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is deeply integrated with the story's core concept.

The final stance—accepting her role as a cultivator rather than a passive witness—is earned through on-page struggle and cost, visible in her tears and soil-stained nails.

    The chief's motivation is clear and rooted in a credible professional ethos, intensifying under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in family loss and a search for belonging. Her micro-choices, like landing the drone and pulling the lever, reveal her values under pressure. The pilgrim's "perpetually surprised" trait is a visible, constraining character detail. A slight deduction for the pilgrim's convenient exposition about her parents, which feels like a minor knowledge leap not fully earned in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, with micro-choices under pressure (using the watch hand to carve lies) revealing her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and contradictory, his embodied emotion ("coat heavy with salt and regret") and micro-choices (offering gloves, humming the lullaby) reveal a complex hierarchy of values under pressure. His final renunciation—giving away the drawer pull and accepting the weight of "recycled mistakes"—is earned by prior causality and carries a visible, felt cost. The only minor weakness is a slight diagnostic lean in the line "recycle mistakes into wisdom," but it is immediately grounded in the concrete object and action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("a sound halfway between a sob and a toast"). The final renunciation—tearing charts into confetti—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. The character's flawed, self-deceptive knowledge state ("navigator whose inner maps had erased themselves") persists until dramatized events correct it.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sister Halcyon's pacifism is a core, active driver of the plot, compelling her to create the sail and open the dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kira's embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are exceptional. Her final renunciation—releasing the fireflies—is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her lost memories made visible as the sand transforms. A hairline slip: the "skeleton of light" metaphor verges on diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Garnet's internal "cradle of sparks" is a concrete, character-specific motivation that compels her higher-stakes choices, and her final choice to deceive Commander Voss is a credible micro-decision under pressure. However, her ally Luce feels more like a functional secondary character than a fully realized crucible for her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—his precognitive helplessness versus his driven promise to Mira—are dramatized in scene, and his final renunciation of understanding for witness is earned by the star dust's activation.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation and worldview are precise and consistent, filtered through tactile choices (sampling, labeling, resisting naming the caterpillar). Interiority is embodied and profession-specific, avoiding stock emotion. The only limit is the modest on-page internal contradiction; the key renunciation (no anthropomorphism, no villains) is subtle rather than pressured by a sharp cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—the kiln “exhale,” the ledger burning her lips—and her contradictory impulses (pursuit vs. refusal) play on the page. Micro‑choices (dropping glass beads, waiting at the ash circle, crushing the ledger) reveal a hierarchy of values. The renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost. A hairline neatness in the final calibration slightly softens messier human fray.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive—translate a silenced world—is clear, embodied, and drives concrete choices (entering, mapping, performing, departing). Her grief/fear/wonder stack credibly, though internal contradiction under peak pressure is more implied than dramatized. Actions align with motives and the reframed drive at the end reads earned. The visible cost is modest but present (battery death, renunciation of restoring “sound” for a new language).

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and evolving: a debt to the dead pulls a man who prefers predictability into risk. Interiority is embodied (salt on lips; “books breathing underwater”), and contradictory impulses (stubborn refusal vs. compulsion to descend) coexist credibly. His final acceptance of tenure at cost to his old life reads earned, sealed by seeing his own name in “Perpetual Repose.” Minor hedge: “inadvertently stubborn” is told, though mostly dramatized through choice and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—sustaining bodies and memory under sanctions—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete micro‑choices (felt‑wrapped bell, collecting offerings, teaching tile patterns, saffron ink on bread). Fear vs duty surfaces viscerally when the bell slips its felt and she freezes. The interiority is largely conveyed through action rather than deep reflection, keeping her human but a touch under‑contradicted. Secondary figures (Lila, youths) sharpen her purpose without on‑page interpersonal contest.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, embodied motivation (finding where unused love is stored) drives concrete choices: assembling the camera, inviting the man, initiating the breath ritual, relinquishing the jade. Contradictory impulses (ache vs. offering) surface on the page. The relationship functions as crucible without names, culminating in a costly gift and mutual vulnerability. Minor note: the protagonist’s internal doubt could spike once more under pressure to deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—stemming from vanishing photographs and the urge to feel time’s “texture”—is clear and drives action to a decisive, high‑cost choice. Interiority is particular and embodied through the living garden’s responses. The leap to “disintegrate the illusion” skirts abstraction but is mostly earned by the fragment burning and the mirror beat. The renunciation of linear self reads as an authentic price that alters her path.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, embodied motive (“plant resilience”) and concrete micro‑choices under pressure; competence feels earned via eleven years of waiting.

Still, actions align tightly with her values and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive is clear and particular—imprint the sound of trust breaking—and her choices (feeding the forge, pressing her ear to iron, pocketing the shard) align under mounting pressure. Her interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“a gap she had preserved by collecting absences”), and the keeper adds direct pressure. The revelation of her complicity provides credible contradiction and a felt cost. Minor note: the turn is insight‑led rather than contested by a live external counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority and micro‑choices under pressure: she decodes the flowers, weighs the moral cost of another cut, demands the ring, and chooses reinterpretation over theft. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. ethical restraint) coexist in scene. The hooded woman applies direct relational pressure with a persuasive price (starlight) and a wound (forgotten husband). The final renunciation feels earned and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: fleeing storms yet courting heat, craving safety yet leaving the sanctuary behind. Embodied interiority (the funeral she never attended; the tactile work of checking for “bloodless edges”) grounds her arc. Micro‑choices (repurposing tape, burning the chair, using the bookmark as spine) reveal values under pressure. Slightly low external friction keeps the crucible mostly internal, but it remains credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Leo’s motives and contradictions (phobia-ridden yet professionally leaping) are vivid and consistent, and his micro‑choices under pressure (kneeling to read the cast, choosing to project the raw footage) reveal a clear values hierarchy. Fear and competence coexist on the page without tidy cure, and the shell’s advice catalyzes an earned shift rather than a sudden epiphany. The child’s brief scene functions as crucible without derailing his arc. The final stance—keep the trembling take—forecloses a safer path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation and inner stance are clear and particular—tender stewardship born of “mild obsession” becomes a resolved vocation. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts (shadow-ink, freezing the guard) rather than labels. The lack of pronounced internal contradiction keeps it just shy of great; she is certain early and never wavers. Still, the final renunciation—choosing the map over the world—is credible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    J4N-17’s drive is clear and consistent—the hunger to locate the origin of thought—and actions (approaching, lifting, and playing the violin) align with that motive. The “remarkably composed” restraint cracking at the timed chime offers a credible internal contradiction. Some interiority leans declarative (“The procedure… planted a question”), softening lived texture. The endurance at the end reads as earned stasis with modestly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motives (repair trust, resist accusation) are clear and drive concrete choices under pressure. The overheard plan triggers a credible internal conflict—confrontation versus facilitating collective absolution—and her restraint reads earned. Embodied perception (“soft as wet gravel,” tactile handling of the lens/ticket) grounds emotion. Secondary characters are thin but apply relevant pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and worldview are specific and consistent: ritual, service, and a humility that complicates the “master” illusion. The internal contradiction—control vs devotion—grounds her choices (polishing marbles, offering them, accepting the glove). Emotional texture is embodied through tactile acts rather than label-speak. The cost is quiet (renunciation of mastery), credible for the length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation (to prove sideways time) collides with embodied ambivalence about her prosthetic lungs and identity. Micro‑choices under pressure—engaging the lever, lowering it by degrees, then renouncing further pull—reveal values with cost. The chrysalis/imago recognition integrates with her actions rather than reading as a tidy label. A slight tilt toward abstraction in one or two lines keeps this just shy of transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character-driven motives (curiosity, invisibility, kinship with the ghost) lead to concrete choices—descending the staircase, opening the hidden door, accepting the “voice.” Interiority is specific to a pit musician’s liminal status, though contradictions under pressure remain largely thematic rather than dramatized via tough trade-offs. Emotional embodiment is effective (water parting, splintered podium), but cost to self or relationships is muted. Final acceptance reads earned, if more conceptual than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied, with the oracle’s contradictory impulses—protection vs. the rising prophetic weight—simultaneously pressuring her choices. Her micro-choices (smudging, stepping into the cold, erasing the illustration, weighing the stone) align with her marginal, probabilistic worldview. Motivation to learn the exact weight is established early and paid off precisely (“4.7 grams”). Slight abstraction around why weight specifically matters is offset by the concrete ledgering of cost and vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Jules’ recklessness and skepticism drive every choice—from tuning the radio to decoding the cadence and turning the wheel—under pressure that reveals conflicting impulses (numbers vs. prayer). Embodied reactions (“flashlight trembling,” bead burns) ground emotion without labels. The climactic weighing reads as a motivated compulsion consistent with the established need for measurables. The visible cost (burns, haunting intake of the “1,887 lbs”) earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear motive and interiority: the oath to “witness change without judgment” binds every choice. Contradiction is alive—she seeks coherence in the river’s silence while edging toward surrender to forgetting. Micro-choices (activating the swan, choosing to write, then leaving) reveal a hierarchy of values. Emotional embodiment is specific (e.g., “ledger heavy,” “silence stitched her frayed thoughts”), though the arc stays contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—rekindling wonder in children—drives every choice, from timing her climb to using the baby curl when the note falters. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“the note…between heartbeats,” the memory of salt breath steadying lungs). The micro‑choice to press the curl under pressure reveals values and cost. Depth of contradiction is light, but the quiet endurance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she collects what walls remember, with embodied responses (tasting ember, feeling the floor tilt). Agency culminates in the ritual choice to press the tapestry to the silo, a renunciation with cost (she gives up the fragment and her solitude reconfigures). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized; the piece favors steadiness over conflict. The ending’s self‑redefinition reads earned by prior sensitivities and micro‑choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Chen’s motive—to orchestrate a final message and disappear into a different life—is clear, consistent, and pushed by contradictory impulses (spy vs. “only wind”). His micro‑choices (palming film, planting the fortune, timing steps with the lens) reveal character under pressure. The keeper adds soft relational pressure without hijacking the scene. The renunciation at the end reads earned with a felt cost (identity and ties relinquished).

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motives (“plumb the congregation’s unspoken fears”) drive concrete micro‑choices and escalate to the self‑risking swallow of doubt. The priest’s internal contradiction—performing faith while weaponizing doubt—registers viscerally. His dynamic with the painter adds pressure and a counter‑lens without head‑hopping. The cost (blood, relinquishing the loop’s armor) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive and urgency (thirty‑minute window) drive concrete micro‑choices: climbing, etching, accelerating at “fifteen minutes left.” Embodied strain (“lungs tasted iron”) grounds the lyric. The contradiction—artist’s compulsion vs. bodily limits—registers, though deeper ambivalence beyond homesickness is lightly sketched. The renunciation cost lands in the shell’s crumbling and her spent body at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s drive (“to conquer the labyrinth of self”) is clear and consistently pressures his choices, with embodied costs like “temporal papercuts” leaking hours. Internal contradiction—self‑annihilation as liberation—culminates in smashing the tablet. Interiority is mostly externalized via image rather than thought, but the actions reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Minor dock for one explicit thematic cue via the elder’s instruction rather than purely emergent realization.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motive (to pierce grief‑numbness) is clear and drives concrete choices—repairing the needle, playing the disc, building the drum. Interiority is embodied through tactile listening and vibration rather than label‑speak; contradictory impulses (seeking hush to break silence) play in scene. Temen adds gentle relational pressure and collaboration without stealing focus. The earned shift—welcoming grief—forecloses avoidance with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s meticulousness and integrity drive every choice, from waiting on the pigeon to rejecting sanctioned data. Interiority is concrete (e.g., “credibly curious” manifests in watchful restraint, not a label). A credible cost lands in her decision to remain underground, foreclosing safety and normal life. Slightly low on contradictory impulses—she’s composed and competent throughout—keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motives are clear and layered: he fears unleashing grief yet is compelled to “catalogue cause.” Interiority is embodied through scent-driven perception and micro-choices (uncapping the vial, measured breaths, the drop on the root). The internal contradiction (wanting tears to be answer vs. needing to understand) acts in-scene and culminates in a credible renunciation/shift. Minor note: his competence in scent-world occasionally smooths struggle, but cost still reads.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, specific interiority anchored by tactile engagement with the rope and clay; contradictory impulses (curiosity toward transcendence vs. fidelity to embodied choosing) operate in scene. The final renunciation reads earned by prior beats. Emotional texture is embodied rather than labeled. Secondary relationships (Marcus, Mrs. Chen) are off‑page but effectively pressure the narrator’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives are lucid and embodied—she comes to “unbind” the bowl and reimagine a family tradition, acting through tactile, specific choices (planting the scorched seed, engineering a resonator). The internal contradiction (legacy of bonfire/crowd vs. solitude/unfinishedness) is credible and drives action. Emotional texture is shown through sensory perception rather than labels. The cost—refusing resolution, leaving the bowl, accepting solitude—lands without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motive (to feel something real) is clear, contradictory to her professional detachment, and dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (taking the petal, not stopping the chemist). Embodiment is specific and character‑particular (“pulse lied often and well,” the bruise‑bloom scent). The relationship with the chemist applies focused pressure without stealing POV. A couple of thesis‑leaning lines flirt with on‑the‑nose (“insight without empathy was just surveillance”) but the change lands credibly with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marisol’s motives—quiet compassion masked as clerical shrewdness—drive every choice, culminating in handing over her locket as a tangible cost. Interiority is specific (“studied the image the way others pray”) and consistent with her anonymity ethic. The dynamic with Beto adds lived history and status nuance without derailing her arc. Minor note: her choices come easily; a touch more friction would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s desire to belong is concrete and acted upon—she initiates the dawn searches, teaches weaving, and ultimately renounces solitude by opening a communal studio. Her interior contradiction (self‑made isolation vs. boldly sympathetic care) is dramatized in confession to Emil and in her steady facilitation of others. The choice to raise the tag and accept the scar reads as a credible cost. Secondary characters apply gentle but real social pressure that sharpens her need.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s goal is clear and felt, and her micro‑choices (cadence breaths, choosing the left spiral, surrendering future minutes) reveal priorities under pressure. The grief motive is embodied via concrete sensory afterimages rather than labels. The final renunciation is earned and costly. Occupation (natural history illustrator) colors perception but is less integral to her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (restore the orchard/approach the master’s absence) drives concrete, inventive choices: aligning the glass eyes, activating the mosaic, climbing, and sealing the astrolabe. Interiority is specific and embodied (“A conjurer does not cry; instead I recited primes…”), revealing tension between discipline and grief. The endurance at the end—accepting ambiguity while restoring motion—carries a felt cost. Slight softness: the ritual unfolds with little resistance, so struggle reads gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is distinct—kindly, methodical, tactile—and his motive to make the voices heard culminates in a credible renunciation of invisibility. Interiority is concrete (mapping joists, tracing oxide like dried blood) without therapy-speak. The relationship with the girl is delicately staged and reconfigures his stance. Internal conflict is subtle rather than overt, so the price of visibility is felt but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s drive for control through science is specific and embodied, and her fear/desire conflict sharpens as the lindens “communicate” and the veins mirror her pulse. Micro‑choices—clipping the leaf, testing in the jar, resisting then surrendering—align with motive and escalate plausibly. The cost of surrender (losing human form) lands as an earned renunciation. Minor hedge: her final conceptual leap (“knowledge wasn’t mastery—it was relationship”) edges toward articulation over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s drive to “thresh meaning from experience” is clear, embodied by sleeplessness and the compulsion to paint. Her micro‑choices (following rain trails, kneeling at shell spirals, accepting the shard, painting with rainwater) align with motive under pressure. The old woman adds focused relational pressure that redirects Mara from self‑recrimination to purposeful work. The final renaming of insomnia as vigilance reads earned, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motives with lived cost: he seeks “everyday magic” and she chooses to transfer power knowing it will fix her in place. Interiority is economical but embodied (the warm pearl, the attempt to return the gift). The attempt to reverse the exchange reveals a credible hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is quieter than maximal, but the renunciation/acceptance arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motive—restore a city by assembling what was scattered—drives concrete choices (seek records, secure trumpet parts, persuade the woman) and reveals a principled, wounded competence. Interiority is specific and embodied (“salt crust,” “valve…absence of sound louder than any note”). The request to “hearten” conflicts with the bitterness of erasure, and the final act carries cost in relinquishing guarded silence. Secondary characters apply pointed pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alden’s compulsions and renunciations are cleanly motivated and embodied through tactile choices (lifting the punch, entering the tunnel, punching his chest). His contradictory impulses—precision vs. painting, silence vs. confession—operate simultaneously under pressure. The final renunciation of silence costs him concretely as memories are “punched” loose. Slight neatness in the self-articulation of insights edges toward tidy but remains earned by linked actions.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior conflict—skepticism versus the pull of felt connection—drives clear micro-choices (righting the telescope, choosing to listen, aligning to her mother’s “forgotten patterns,” transcribing as music). Embodied beats (tile lifting, whale song felt in marrow) translate emotion into action. The final renunciation of publishable proof for trust reads as an earned, costly shift. Minor safety-hedging is avoided; her flaw (rational overreach) is confronted without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vey’s motive—boredom fused to the wound of “goodbye”—is clear and drives every micro‑choice, culminating in the renunciation at the door. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“iron boredom in his blood”), with embodied perception rather than labels. The technician leader is sketched efficiently, applying credible social pressure without stealing focus. Slight coolness at peak moments keeps the emotional contradiction from cresting into the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cassidy’s motive is razor‑clear and consistent, and her internal calculus (“what memory equals a mother’s life?”) manifests in concrete, costly action. Status dynamics with Rurik are legible and shift when the ink takes him. Rurik reads slightly emblematic, but his cold pragmatism exerts real pressure. The final renunciation (losing the lullaby) is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear (collecting “textures of different times”), and contradictory impulses appear in scene: she tries to stop writing out of fear but continues because “understanding outweighed caution.” Embodied perception (moss luminescence, vibration through wrist bones) keeps emotion grounded. Final cost is felt: she sacrifices a forgery and accepts a heavier truth.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, character-particular motive—refusing bureaucratic erasure by accreting others’ stories—drives concrete micro-choices (pocketing the ampoule-count shard, swallowing the stevedore’s sentence, keeping the reel). The internal contradiction between the poison label’s “chemical ending” and the chosen composite identity is dramatized, not declared. Emotions are embodied through tactile acts (tape against chest, frost-breath like cassette ribbon). The final renunciation—embracing a stitched self—reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen’s drive (debunking vs. longing to be surprised) creates credible contradiction that sharpens choices, especially when he presses the compass to his chest and leaves proof behind. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “truth ought to remain porous”). Micro‑choices (shell placement, retelling voices, refusing varnish, not looking back) reveal a hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in places keeps some emotions at a lyrical remove, but not enough to blunt motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s motives and contradictions are vivid and embodied—the stone chip, the breath‑counting walk, and the “foundation questioned” tag show a mind torn between preservation and survival. Her agency drives the collective reorganization and the coded summons, with micro‑choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Emotional texture is particular (calliope, rice‑paper poems) without therapy‑speak shortcuts. If anything, the personal cost remains more conceptual than felt pain on the body/relationship level.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inspector’s goal and tactics are precise and embodied—timed reagents, tripod, antique camera—revealing a professional, grieving mind. Contradictory impulses (“witnessing as resistance” vs. the urge to shoot now) surface in the wait before the shutter. Small micro-choices under pressure (burying the half-grain, dribbling water, holding breath) layer credibility. The character’s flaw—purposeful curiosity shading into elegiac theft—pays off in the final, costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motive and skillset are distinct and embodied, with tactile methods and credible micro‑choices under pressure. The infirmary memory reframes the “jitter” as trauma translation, deepening her interiority. Internal contradiction is light—she stays remarkably composed—so the arc reads more as mastery than struggle. The apprentice dynamic adds texture but exerts minimal pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s motive—pursuing origins against bureaucratic containment—is clear, embodied, and drives concrete choices (ignoring the hail, speaking “mayu,” descending, transmitting image over coordinates). Her dry wit and confidence read through action rather than labels, and the Registry tension gives her a credible internal conflict. The visible costs (tearing the page, risking dismissal as myth, burning the last coffee) ground the endurance at the end. Slightly more on-the-page friction between duty and compulsion at the moment of descent could sharpen the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motive—restore shared balance—drives concrete choices (seven circuits, striking the keystone, sacrificing the fork) and culminates in a costly renunciation of self. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the hollow inside his chest”), with guilt and patience braided into action. The primary limitation is the near‑saintly calibration; contradictory impulses are present but lightly stressed. Still, the final choice is clearly earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s motive is immediate and intensifying (get a signal out before air runs out), and her contradictory impulses (flee vs. go deeper; keep the vial vs. spend it) play out in concrete choices. The sacrifice of the crystal vial is a specific, felt cost tied to identity and past. Interiority stays embodied (“knees bruised by pressure and guilt,” “lungs burning”) and decisions align with character. Minor note: she reads highly competent with few lasting flaws beyond guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s desire to reject inherited falsehood and pursue the hush into the labyrinth is clear and embodied through concrete micro‑choices (taking the lattice, speaking to keep the stairs forming, touching the pipe). His interior conflict—born of his father’s lie yet refusing to “become silence”—is dramatized rather than declared. The forgiveness line lands as earned, not platitudinous. Cost is felt but remains more spiritual than material.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motives drive both figures: her debt and his survival. Interiority is lyric but specific—fear “bright as lantern light,” and the “lovingly venomous” ethic refracts through both. The boy’s hesitation on the ice and choosing the ghost’s hand shows credible contradiction and cost. Some emotional distance remains due to the elevated register, but choices read earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Calyx’s motives (to reweave what’s broken) are clear and embodied in choices: surrendering to the dream, sewing the plate into the loom, and paying blood as price. Interiority is vivid and particular without therapy‑speak, though conflict mostly manifests as ritual surrender rather than contested will. The contradiction—surrender vs. agency—adds texture but remains gentle. The final renunciation (letting the loom and precedents sink) reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Her motive—rebuilding a shattered faith—drives concrete choices (kneeling to whisper the hymn, excavating, using the rib as gnomon), and the earned renunciation at the end (“She never left the island again”) lands as real cost. Interiority is embodied via tactile noticing (fossilized petals, myrrh air) rather than labels. Minor shortfall: limited on‑page contradiction under pressure; the boy’s challenge pricks but doesn’t force a fraught trade‑off beyond the final staying.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority with credible contradiction between the need to be known and the compulsion to hide. Embodied choices—the chalk spiral, pressing the clipboard to her chest—reveal stakes under pressure. The final renunciation (mailing the unsigned letter, keeping the confession) feels earned. A tiny ding for one line of explanatory self‑awareness that edges toward telling.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The embroiderer’s motive—to listen and act under the guise of senility—translates into concrete, high‑risk choices (laying the cloth on the projector while armed men look on). Contradictory impulses (playful comets vs. precise vectors; lullaby vs. exposure) operate simultaneously. Embodied actions (synchronizing heartbeat, trimming the wick, folding the cloth) reveal character under pressure. Secondary figures are sketched but serve to heighten her crucible rather than deepen relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: pockets of unsent letters, a guilt that “taught me cruelty could feel like freedom,” and the compulsion to speak in the “seam.” Contradictory impulses (flight vs. return) are dramatized, not labeled. The medium applies live pressure without stealing agency. The apology choice forecloses the path of silence with cost felt in the moths/letters release.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is precise and embodied—cordite on the tongue, “unknot by naming” as credo under pressure. The child’s plea and tap on the coral apply live relational pressure that forces confession and the choice to stay. Contradictory impulses (morphine-softened perception vs. urgent decoding) coexist credibly. The earned renunciation—sharing the birthday, altering the discharge—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Luma’s motive—recovering a lost joy/color—drives concrete micro‑choices: pocketing the shard, invoking the Lattice, accepting the “living wall” constraint, and spending sorrow to paint. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“palette in hand,” “colors arrived first, then motion”). The cost is visible (her sighs, the fragment dissolving, “heart over‑exposed”). No relationship crucible, but the internal contradiction (yearning vs. pain of exposure) stays live and earns the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s need for control versus the nickel’s lure of curiosity is dramatized through tactile choices (spoon, coin, inverted note). Her “methodically playful” trait is enacted, not labeled, and the moment she declares “I will never be certain…” is earned by prior beats. Cost registers as a foregone finished restoration and identity shift. Minor note: interior contradiction could show one more stumble before the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlo’s motive—guarding defiant thought—drives specific, risky choices (planting the seed under surveillance, invoking the passphrase, exploiting the ventilation). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“tasting nectar and nerves”) with competent but not invulnerable swagger. The Voss exchange clarifies status and pressure. Limited contradiction inside Arlo (mostly fear vs. resolve) keeps the arc persuasive but not deeply torn.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zale’s desire and exhaustion are concrete and consistent; contradictory impulses (compelled upward vs. hollowing fatigue) play in scene. Micro-choices—climbing, reading the postscript, peeling and planting the postcard—align with motive and reveal values. Interiority remains character‑particular via tactile anchors (cool limestone, dew planetarium). Slight remove from embodied cost early keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s desire to preserve names and her willingness to pay with memories culminate in an earned, costly self-erasure. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart, shaped like a foxglove”), with a credible tension between gentle procedure and aching regret. The Por memory grounds the sacrifice in personal specificity rather than abstraction. Minor limitation: interior contradiction is elegant but not deeply contested on the page before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive—to repair generational silence and retool a dangerous language—drives concrete micro‑choices (writing each promise, daring the final phrase). Contradictory impulses (careful vs. reckless) are embodied in her trembling hand and disciplined prep. The cost—her voice subsumed/reconfigured—is felt, not just declared. Slight abstraction in places keeps the inner conflict from absolute peak.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mireya’s motives and competence are vivid and consistent, and her invitation to Corin is a decisive, character‑driven turn. Interiority is embodied through tactile tools and thermal “breath,” avoiding label‑speak. The compromise (70/30) crystallizes her ethic under pressure with a felt cost (defying the Council, risking sabotage). Corin’s shift undercuts a simple hero/obstructor dynamic and reframes their relationship as the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motives are concrete and embodied (meteorite chip in cheek; balancing under the skylight) and her flaw—compulsion to both erase and preserve—drives choices. Micro‑choices (hiding the chip, accepting Blackwood’s sanctuary, launching pigeons) align with a credible inner conflict. Relationship pressure with Blackwood is understated but effective, tilting her from secrecy toward collaboration. Minor deduction: internal contradiction is more thematic than dramatized in a single pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Juniper’s motivation—to decipher her father’s message and the sanctity of thresholds—is clear and consistently embodied in tactile choices (barefoot reading of floorboards, decoding grain). The internal conflict between seeking her father and accepting his absence surfaces in the final renunciation. A touch of overt articulation (“She understood now…”) slightly flattens ambiguity, but actions align tightly with motive. The closing acceptance carries felt cost without false tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear (scientific mapping) and deepens into ritual/reciprocity, with embodied choices: she withholds data, risks time, and performs the rite. Contradictory impulses (record vs. revere; leave vs. stay) are dramatized, not told. The final renunciations (not recording; tearing out the atlas page) feel earned by preceding beats. Minor note: her fear of missing the sub could press her more directly in one line for added bite.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s drive (discover why paths disappear before her memory fades) is consistent and embodied through tactile choices—pressing the crater glass, planting seeds, writing and relinquishing. The inner contradiction (laughing and crying; preservation vs. self‑erasure) reads credible. The decisive cost—living without personal memory—is legible and thematically integral. Slight softness: pressure rarely forces a hard trade‑off in-scene beyond the already accepted sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cass’s motive and method are crisp and embodied; her analytical bent guides concrete micro-choices (tide charts, prime-number strobes) and a principled refusal of credit. The inner contradiction—control versus surrender—is dramatized by the public orchestration and the private donation of the second bishop. Emotional textures are conveyed through attention and tactic rather than label-speak. The cost is quiet but legible: she relinquishes authorship to preserve wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—she returns to inscribe a forbidden “cosmic verse” on her body—and every action flows from that drive. The internal contradiction (choosing absence yet compelled back) is dramatized rather than explained. Micro‑choices (dancing the gaps, coaxing dust, accepting bruised constellations) reveal values under pressure. Stakes feel personal and costly without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—paying “debts of beauty” before sunrise—is clear and particular, and her craft anchors her interiority. Embodied perception (salt wind, kelp, the harmonica’s ghost note) reveals character without labels. The renunciation of the prism is a credible cost consistent with her values. A true internal contradiction under pressure is minimal; serenity slightly softens the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motives and contradictions are vivid: the vow to keep guilt “a mute ember” versus the compulsion to speak. Embodied choices—pressing ash to his tongue, speaking to the ridge, drawing the spiral, deciding to face the survivors’ group—make the arc earned. The fire‑ground past informs present tactics without exposition bloat. A faint whiff of thesis language (“he understood then…”) slightly softens the rawness but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motive—revitalizing reality by engineering hope—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (the patterning, the blood, the reset to “unknown”) reveal a precise hierarchy of values. The logical/lyric tension (“logical dreamer” who needs more than numbers) gives her interiority texture. However, pressure is mostly internal and gentle; we don’t see a sharp contradictory impulse forcing a painful trade‑off on the page. The cost reads as conceptual (risking uncertainty), not viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motive (map echoes) deepens credibly into lineage and guilt; her micro‑choices—lifting the negative, following the sigh, descending the hatch—reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“legacy’s burden” shifting from cadence to cost). A slight drift toward fated surrender at the climax trims agency, but the choice to go down is still hers. The endurance/absorption ending carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—steal/borrow a child’s heartbeat to persuade mirrors—and her shift from painter of lies to mirror feels earned. Interiority is mostly shown through embodied ritual (song, dance, heartbeat) rather than labels. A touch more contradiction under pressure would deepen her—guilt vs resolve is present but kept mostly in lyric summary. The final renunciation of “painting lies” registers as a credible, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong single-POV interiority with clear motive (end the forever war) and embodied guilt via the clipboard and list of the dead. Her key actions—convening the ritual, reading names, signing—align with her values and history. Some phrasing trends abstract (“redemption’s price”) and slightly blunts contradiction in-the-moment. Still, the endurance choice at the end reads earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Richly contradictory interiority (engineered drought vs. reverence for the birds) drives concrete actions—kneeling, split nails, tears, the ritual with the music box. Motivation is specific and sustained, and the micro‑choices (winding the box, placing the egg) align with his amoral calculus. The emotional progression is credible and embodied, not just asserted. The arc lands as Earned Stasis/acceptance rather than a full pivot, but it feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lys’s motive—to break the lullaby—drives every choice, with credible costs: risking selfhood, surrendering stolen echoes, and refusing escape. Interiority surfaces through embodied images (blood answering in iambs), not labels, and her renunciation at the gate reads earned. Internal contradiction (terror within serenity; chaste by contract vs. chaste by choice) is present, though largely via image rather than direct psychic friction. A hair more moment-to-moment doubt under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lucien’s motive—refusing to be conscripted yet seeking ethical purpose—is clear and pressures each beat, culminating in a credible renunciation (“letter them with questions”). Interiority is particular (ink, ash, pain) and contradictions (elitism vs. service, silence vs. public writing) are dramatized rather than told. The finger-burn forces a micro-choice that reveals values. A slight drift into aphorism softens embodied struggle near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—honoring overlooked histories through a fragile memorial—is vivid and consistent, and her actions align tightly with that value. We get embodied emotion (breath tasting of moss, tears after release) and concrete micro-choices (pausing at the butterfly’s interrupted cadence, accelerating the weave). Internal contradiction is limited; she does not face a sharp ethical grind or competing demands beyond letting go. The final renunciation (releasing the wing and memorial) lands as a credible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rich, character‑particular interiority ties craft, guilt, and forgiveness to concrete action. The smashed‑organ backstory complicates motive and makes the night’s gentleness a credible reversal. Micro‑choices (warming strands, threading holes) embody care and restraint under pressure. The change—reframing preservation and relinquishing guilt—reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Foresight Hindsight Only’s motive—answering the path/walker riddle under the Council’s charge—is clear and consistent, and her choices (lying on the lens, stepping into the storm) align. Interiority is vivid and embodied through tactile images (metal sweating, circuits veining her ribs). Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal; surrender arrives with little on‑page resistance. Still, the final renunciation reads earned and carries felt cost (self‑dissolution into storm/setting).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Naram-bel’s motives—preserving a cosmology before conquest—are clear and intensify under the ticking dawn. His fear of testing the tile vs. the urgency to act creates credible internal friction that resolves in an Earned Stasis vow. Interiority is specific to his vocation (schematics, numbers, constellations) and embodied through tactile choices. The final renunciation carries felt cost: self-erasure from courts and kings.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motive (“scheming pacifist”) drives every beat, and her contradiction—teaching release while harboring resentment—peaks credibly in the shadow-Lira confrontation. Interiority is embodied through the tactile music box and somatic recall. The choice to absorb her own anger and leave the box reads as a costly renunciation. Minor limitation: secondary figures (soldier, girl) are evocative but function mainly as mirrors.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear (recapture the runaway dream) and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost. The interior conflict—maker of erased boundaries realizing he has drawn one around himself—lands specifically via the reflection language. Embodied action (breath work, frost, tool use) keeps emotions grounded. The epiphany edges tidy, but it’s earned by the device’s hum and the dream’s mirrored rebuke.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crisp: heal the orchard after the council’s breach, guided by maternal teaching and love for her daughter. Interiority is embodied through tools and acts (gear as graft, ribbon as pendulum) rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (feisty defiance vs. tender caretaking) coexist credibly, culminating in barring the elders at a cost. Minor limitation: conflict is largely internal/ritual rather than sharply contested on page until the door-barring beat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s conflicting drives—ambition for forbidden knowledge versus dread of being grafted—are dramatized through concrete micro-choices (asking the mirror, refusing to carve, burning Quell’s memories). The bathroom-breakthrough motif grounds her interiority in lived experience rather than labels. Her renunciation forecloses a powerful path with a felt cost. Minor hedge: the post‑orchard fragment slightly blurs the final emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives (rescue, recover “unlearned lessons”) are clear and her choices under pressure—freeing the traveler, sacrificing a year—align with a consistent, “carefully resourceful” temperament. Interiority is particular, filtered through linguistics and botany, with embodied actions (crushing verbena, folding absences) revealing values. The partnership with the traveler creates limited but effective relationship pressure. Internal contradiction is light; the piece favors resolute competence over fraught ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cassia’s motive is clean and persistent, and her micro-choices (offering the swatch, riding the carousel, accepting the EXIT) track with the identity pressure. Interiority is conveyed through precise, idiosyncratic sensory perception rather than labels. The chimera relationship adds textured pressure without overshadowing the POV. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—comprehension over possession—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (placing the seal, reweaving threads, pressing her palm) align with it. Interiority is particular (temperature‑hued silk, cataloging anomalies), but internal contradiction is minimal; she meets few counterpressures beyond interpretive difficulty. The arc lands as earned poise rather than a hard trade‑off, with limited felt cost. Strong, specific professional texture elevates characterization despite low overt conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, urgent motivation (“find the quiet in the storm”) drives concrete choices at each beat. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (ice augury, breath control) rather than abstract labels. The relationship with Jalen adds pressure and stakes without stealing focus, though her inner contradiction is muted—she reads as highly competent with little visible doubt. The cost at the end (cracking the stone, risking memory loss) feels earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and persistent—rekindle the lamp to prove coincidence has meaning—and it coheres with her retrocognitive curse. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“boots crunching…,” “retro­cognition spill like hot metal”). Change at the end—she “became the new prism”—reads as an earned renunciation with cost. A deeper on‑page contradiction under pressure (hesitation, doubt during the hush) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear—she aims to “sculpt identity from experience” before the fog softens—and her choices (trading cloth, mapping the spiral, signing as witness) align. Interiority is specific and embodied (preemptive nostalgia vs duty), with a tangible cost in relinquishing the banner strip and accepting her footprints’ erasure. The renunciation of ownership at the end is credible and earned. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is present but gentle rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Luma’s motive—defying the “gravity of hopelessness”—is concrete and embodied through her chant, the rag, and micro‑choices (kneeling to feel the mosaic, choosing to “Catch,” stepping into the sphere). Emotional texture is specific (her laugh “half sob, half fuse”) with credible weariness turned to risk. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (fatigue vs. wonder); a sharper on‑page cost to her identity could push this higher. With no other character on the page, relational pressure is absent but not missed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motives are clean and character-specific: she flees to the grotto to seek a sideways answer to reconciliation, and her micro-choices (shifting the lantern, setting/offering the cicada) reveal her value hierarchy. Interiority is embodied through observation, not labels, and the daughter’s hesitant arrival adds real relational pressure. The change—mutual re-entry into dialogue—feels earned with visible cost (vulnerability, time). Minor softness: conflict remains gentle; sharper internal contradiction could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—she seeks “flavors of different silences” to outgrow claustrophobia—and her micro‑choices under pressure (limiting exposure, trading a memory, stepping through the membrane, renouncing the final silence) track cleanly. Embodied interiority is strong via sensory textures (iron‑sweet, lullaby, bolt‑sigh). The renunciation and leaving the doll accrue real cost. A hairline note: the keeper’s trade is swift, but it still reads motivated and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Nilo’s motives—curating hush, teaching silence—drive specific actions (the 27 dB rule, throttling down, ritualizing confession). The commuter’s fear lands embodied and particular, and their brief relationship has a clean pressure dynamic. Interiority is largely externalized through tools and environment but still reads character-specific. Depth of internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle for the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clean and consistent (Keeper Line duty, sunrise deadline), and actions align with it throughout. Interiority is sensory and task-focused, but internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely doubts or falters. The final acceptance of responsibility reads earned but low-cost. Strong competency under pressure, light on genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shadow keeper’s motives are clear and embodied—self‑imposed isolation, ritual competence, and the perverse practice of “learning to suffocate.” Her micro‑choices (summoning, linking scars, urging but not forcing) align with her contradictions and reveal cost. The boy functions as a pressure‑bearing secondary, clarifying her own damage. A slight hedge is the tidy articulation of her insight in one line rather than fully through action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lira’s motive chain is specific and credible: the MLM trauma, the 42 Hz compulsion, and her “virtuously mischievous” bent drive concrete choices. Contradictory impulses—spending forgiveness as currency and later discarding the diamond—render a live internal conflict with cost. Embodied detail (cold brass on skin, spores, blood) grounds emotion. Minor abstraction flickers, but never derails motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Arin’s motivation is crystalline and sustained: to retrieve and broadcast the dynasty’s buried confession. Interiority is textured through tactile, sense‑driven perception (dust as “ancestral breath,” tears making “pale mud”). Contradictory impulses are present but muted—resolve dominates over doubt—yet the choice to speak publicly at cost (“name burned clean”) feels earned. Muse functions as a subtle relational pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Calen’s hunger “to capture the shape of possibility” is enacted through concrete micro‑choices—kneeling, pressing the program to soil, accepting the seed. Contradictory impulses (oathbound withdrawal versus yearning for possibility) coexist and resolve into a credible reconfiguration. The cost surfaces viscerally when frost spells the names he deserted and through the binding allegiance. Slight distance from secondary relationships keeps the crucible primarily inward, but it works for this frame.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rowan’s motives—staying for a stipend vs. waiting for “one small kindness”—are specific, contradictory, and sharpen into action when she discovers the button. Her embodied choices (brushing dust, creating a new database entry, placing the button with a cautious note) align with her archivist identity and foster history. The internal conflict is credible, and the final choice carries an emotional price: acting without certainty but with responsibility. Minor safety-hedging is avoided by the measured, non-omniscient note she writes for Marcus.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motive and tactics are clear and consistent, with concrete micro-choices (timing drones, threading tape, wiring the ringer). Interiority is embedded in sensory attention (boardwalk, puddles) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light—she’s resolute more than torn—so complexity under peak pressure is somewhat limited. The ending shows credible cost (hands raised, risk of arrest) earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Desire and duty are clear and embodied: he plays to hush a code-voiced prophecy while fearing its death-date clause. Micro-choices under pressure (altered fingering, the copper-tasting diminished chord, the retrograde erasure note) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. Inherited motive (mother’s breath-measured lesson) deepens without drifting into summary. The ending’s endurance cost (throat raw, tomorrow he must return) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mireya’s motivation is crystalline and embodied (“decode… before the arbor drifted”), and her occupational habits color every choice. Interiority is particular (mossy humming, seed‑sorting to calm), but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers. Micro‑choices (prodding bark, weighting leaves with monuments) reveal values without speechifying. The change at the end is credible but paid with minimal personal cost beyond fatigue and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—“uncertainly certain”—materialize in concrete choices: he stops mending to “listen,” descends, retrieves, then relinquishes the objects and his trade. Embodied beats (“chill climb my ribs,” “arms wide”) carry interiority without therapy‑speak. The renunciation costs him vocation and certainty, felt in “Out Tinkering Indefinitely.” Slight softness: minimal interpersonal crucible limits pressure on his blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Alder’s motive (redeem/name’s weight) is crystal-clear and drives each micro‑choice: waiting for solitude, melting the coin, accepting the mirror’s challenge, then releasing the tube. Interiority is embodied through tactile procedures and scents rather than abstraction. Contradictory impulses—clinging vs. letting go—coexist and culminate in a costly renunciation. A slight limit: his flaw set could show one more moment of resistance before surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular—she collects laughter-splinters and adapts to a new fracture with concrete tactics. Interiority emerges through embodied ritual (pressing the crocodile tooth to her lips) and task-focused attention. Internal contradiction is subtle (tenderness paired with a vocation built on fracture), but the piece leans more on competence than friction. The sacrifice of her talisman gives the ending a credible cost and earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline (“discover the mathematics of mercy”) and actions align: bracing, counting, tearing off the strap. Interiority is embodied and particular (proprioceptive spikes, “ledger” of sap). The paradox—seeking mercy through pain—creates real tension. A slight abstraction haze keeps a layer of emotional vulnerability shielded.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear motive (seeking “overlooked histories”) drives concrete choices: pausing at the stall, leaning into the painting, stepping through, and relinquishing the shard. The internal tension—keeper vs. returner—registers in the cost of letting go, even if resistance is understated. Interiority is specific and embodied (copper/salt taste, rope‑sway vertigo). The renunciation feels earned by the boy‑self recognition and the mother’s maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives (retrieve the mainspring; manage ghosts like stalled cars) are crisp and her competence feels earned through tool use and micro‑choices. “Unwilling ghost‑seer” versus her professional firmness gives a credible internal tension without speechifying. The realization about cracks inside her reconfigures her stance with a subtle price (agreeing to carry and redistribute the burden). Stakes are more contemplative than perilous, but her choices consistently drive the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Corwin’s motive—repairing a “cracked chase” by risking a warned-against compression—drives concrete choices (setting type, uncorking the whisper, stepping onto cloud). The warning (“Compress eternity and the sky will notice”) creates a credible internal contradiction he resolves by acting anyway. Emotional texture is embodied through tactile craft and breath rather than labels. Slight limitation: the conflict is mostly interior/lyric, with minimal resistance beyond the cautioned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aurelio’s interiority is vivid and embodied (blood on shard, counting heartbeats unmoored), and his contradictory impulses—futility vs. compulsion to mark meaning—coexist on the page. His choices (uncovering the mirror during the storm; inscribing a line that risks catalyzing collapse) align with his history and poet’s temperament. The Mira exchange lightly pressures him toward action without stealing focus. The ending’s renunciation of tidy answers (giving Mira the shard, accepting storms) reads earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motive is clear and layered (save the city vs. repair a failure with his daughter), and his confession under pressure shows credible contradiction and cost. His micro‑choices—speaking truth, placing the chip, “mending what isn’t torn”—align with his identity. The emotional price (vulnerability and relinquishing the chip) feels earned. Minor softness: the mechanics proceed smoothly after confession, reducing struggle at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ivy’s motives (collecting “beginnings,” seeking where explanations fail) stay coherent and drive every choice, with embodied beats like knees buckling under borrowed awe. The terror-then-polite acceptance is a crisp internal contradiction that culminates in the costly tribute of her vials. Micro-choices (pressing the compass to her sternum, pushing the rock, initiating the reading) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The transformation into “hinge” feels earned via prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maela’s motives (gift vs. geas; escape reimagined as arrival) are clear and embodied through tactile choices: wedging the slide, carving with the wood’s “memory,” and drowning the GPS. Interiority is specific to a craftswoman under storm pressure, with sensory bias and lived technique. The final renunciation is earned, with a felt cost in relinquishing technological certainty. A minor softness: the transformation borders smooth, but contradictory impulses (control/surrender; map/hand) do act concurrently on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motive (to grasp why night‑bloomers open) is enacted through concrete, costly choices—sleeping in frost, arranging “rose window” branches, painting panes, and ultimately leaving the pavilion. Interiority is particular and embodied (frost on eyelashes; “umbral tenderness” in her chest). Contradictory impulses—public gaze vs. private hush—remain in tension without tidy self‑explanation. The renunciation (walking west) reads earned, with emotional cost carried from the winter grief thread.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Motivation is crystalline and intensifies: an archivist compelled to exhume suppressed truth even at the cost of her future. Contradictory impulses (shame, filial loyalty, professional duty) act simultaneously as she bargains pieces of her future for pages of the past. Micro‑choices are vivid—radioing isolation, laying grammars of shells, accepting the cost with each page. The final decision to broadcast over the capital is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Veyra’s motives and contradictions are vivid: she refuses wish‑comfort yet aches for renewal, shown in concrete micro‑choices (speaking prices, arranging the mandala, ringing the bell, smashing the bottle). Embodied perception (“smell of rain on hot stone”) grounds emotion. The renunciation—destroying the relic—feels earned and costly. Limited on‑page relationships slightly narrow the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ambrose’s motives are clean and character‑specific: the oath scribe who archives emotion confronts an accidental prophecy that may harm the city. His choice to immerse the shaving, then to inscribe and voice the Hittite phrase, reveals contradictory impulses (preserve vs. silence) enacted on the page. Embodied details (quince ink, consecrated tweezers, forehead to bark) ground emotion. The only slight limit is the absence of a relational crucible, keeping pressure mostly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character-specific motive (save and re-order inheritance) drives concrete choices: scattering seeds, surrendering heat, holding steady, refusing the doorway. Contradictory impulses (“furiously tranquil”) are embodied in breath, cold, and restraint. The renunciation—remaining as archivist—lands with felt cost. Slight abstraction in places keeps us a half-step from deeper biographical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions (duty vs. “favor listening over noise”) are clear and embodied through tactile choices with the rope, toggle, and barometer. Her grief for her father grounds specificity without stalling momentum. The unauthorized switch is credibly earned by her curiosity and lineage. Cost is present but quiet: professional risk and a renunciation of protocol rather than melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV interiority is vivid and embodied; his kneeling, whispering, and final renunciation align cleanly with his grief and curiosity. The micro-choices (touching the fleck, leaving the lenses open, abandoning the lantern) read motivated and reveal values. Internal contradiction is quieter—he moves steadily toward openness rather than wrestling with competing impulses on the page. The change lands credibly with felt cost, though pressure against his choice is mostly atmospheric, not contested.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alden’s motive (keeping unspoken words) is clear, embodied in ritual and object-handling, and culminates in a credible renunciation (breaking his silence to commit). The internal contradiction—stay and mend versus leave and release—is legible and resolved with cost. Interiority is shown through his perception of ash/ghosts and tactile engagement with the box. Slight repetition of “tranquilly perceptive” softens edge but doesn’t harm the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct, embodied interiority and a coherent motive (to feel time’s texture) guide concrete choices: visiting the silo, climbing, building the cairn, trading the shard. The urn fragment trade reads as a meaningful cost and reveals value hierarchy. Internal contradiction is light; curiosity dominates with little friction against fear or doubt. Secondary characters apply gentle, not acute, pressure, keeping the crucible modest.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s motives are clear and embodied—“to tend the horizon with words”—and he makes concrete micro‑choices (drawing the spiral, tearing his sleeve, giving the feather) that reveal values under gentle pressure. Interiority is rendered through sensory perception rather than labels, and contradictions (preserving the incomplete while shaping it) are lived rather than explained. The relationship with the woman adds a crucible of collaboration that slightly reframes his task without melodrama. Stakes are quiet but credible, culminating in an earned renunciation (letting the tide erase his line).

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mateo’s motive (six months to live → finish a multispecies “remodel”) is clear and embodied through meticulous actions and diary entries. His gently systematic nature constrains choices (mapping circuits, replacing insulation, adding alternate paths). The final act—closing the circuit through his own body—reads as a credible, values‑driven cost. Slight limitation: interior contradiction is muted; serenity dominates over felt ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motives are clear and consistent—skepticism sharpened into inquiry—and her on‑page choices (tracking footprints, sampling, mapping) align with that drive. Interiority is specific (the pendant’s warmth; the “bronze quiet”) and avoids stock feelings. The internal contradiction (skeptic versus longing for a true “home”) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized under pressure. The closing renunciation (“warn about the price of artificial belonging”) lands, though the felt cost is mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, specific motive (“to let a garden reclaim the battlefield”) drives repeated, tactile choices (crushing pods, singing old tongues, waiting). Interiority is embodied via “narrow vastness,” bird‑dialects, and material tokens (the rusted button). The final easing of breath reads earned by ritual persistence and on‑page acceptance from the reef. Minor limitation: few contradictory impulses are dramatized under real counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Scraps’ motive—retired from death‑finding yet compelled to collapse distance—drives concrete choices (nudging the leaf, leading the trek, digging). The contradiction between renunciation and compulsion is embodied and paid through effort and risk, if softly. Kite’s desire is clear and active without flattening Scraps’ agency. Emotional texture is vivid though the path remains relatively unopposed, muting deeper strain.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s grief, guilt, and ritual-driven yearning are concrete and embodied, culminating in a credible, high-cost choice to take his mother’s hand. Micro-choices under pressure (opening the sketchbook, retrieving the pencil, opening the hatch, crawling in) reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—survivor’s guilt versus the need for connection and meaning—coexist on the page. The endurance/renunciation cost of leaving the ordinary world reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vespers’ motives (to coax wonder, to “steal” what others can’t keep) are dramatized through specific actions—climbing, the secret bishop swap, inviting Halcyon onto the shadow stair, and passing the sundial to a child. Interiority is mostly carried by tactile, character‑particular gestures and choices rather than reflection. The relationship pressure with Halcyon is brief but legible, with status dynamics in the challenge and her dare. A minor limit: her inner contradiction is suggested but not deeply contested on the page, so struggle feels elegant more than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior drives every beat, with specific, embodied tactics (heel‑toe spelling, lace on the queen) revealing a credo forged from her crisis-actor past. The Kestrel dynamic sharpens status and memory stakes without sentimentality; his kneel and her answer with “Adel” are earned micro-choices. The “benevolently ruthless” ethic is dramatized, not told, in how she preserves softness by severing context. Only slight: the cost of her archival ethic skews conceptual over visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, felt motivation (“to understand the shape of home”) meets credible fear; the choice to let the feather write on her own body is an earned, high‑cost act. Interiority is specific (copper air, mirrored palms, humming stone) rather than label‑speak. The cracked mercury glass externalizes contradiction—self‑protection versus belonging. Minor: the old man applies little pressure beyond naming the want.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, specific interiority and embodied guilt drive concrete micro‑choices (decoding, walking the maze, righting the king). Contradictory impulses—predatory clarity vs. shame—coexist on the page. The change (from punitive self‑exile to reframed acceptance) is earned by prior beats. Slight neatness to the self‑forgiveness arc keeps it just shy of the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motives (to refract and redistribute blame) are clear, character-specific, and tested under time pressure. Contradictory impulses—defiance vs. guilt—operate simultaneously and culminate in the earned shift from speaking to listening. The acceptance of cost and plan to paint with her own blood foreclose a path credibly. Embodied emotion and micro-choices (climb, angle mirror, stop reciting, whisper acceptance) reveal her values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motive—trading survival for meaning—is clear, pressured, and internally contradictory in scene. Embodied details (breath-timing, trembling masked by the rebreather) ground emotion and micro‑choices. Her final decision reads earned by prior tactics and fear. Minor note: a few thesis‑sounding lines brush abstraction but do not break motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ren’s motives are clean and particular: the mirror’s failure triggers a renunciatory vow to “go where no one has already painted.” His aloofness vs longing collides on the underground beach, where “intimately aloof no longer” marks a clear internal turn. Micro‑choices (entering the cleft without hesitation, copying the shell, wedging it at high‑tide mark) align with values and cost. The Earned Stasis—leaving with empty hands—feels both credible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, specific motivation (“prove whispers travel farther”) drives concrete micro‑choices—waiting out the heat, tuning the beacon, whispering into the cork, and beckoning. Interiority is sensorial and embodied rather than diagnostic, with tactile focus on scent, glass, and pulse. Internal contradiction is subtle (need to reach out vs. acceptance of loss) but could press harder. The closing endurance stance feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Desire and cost are embodied and specific: she literally solders hair and offers her stitched self to become the map. The navigator/offering contradiction creates live tension that sharpens at the center spiral. Micro‑choices (unscrewing, spiraling lines, speaking names into the censer foot) reveal values under pressure. If anything, her inner debate remains mostly enacted rather than verbalized, leaving a hairline distance from 9+ complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority and credible contradiction (a rational skeptic undone by a relic) drive concrete choices: pocketing the eye, resisting burial, then planting it. Confession under storm pressure embodies cost without tidy absolution. The sister’s ghost scene sharpens stakes without neat repentance. Minor hedge: a few abstractions (“psychological safety”) skim distance from fully embodied feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maris’s interiority is specific and embodied—she reads absences like signals and makes micro‑choices (pinning the flower, scanning for gaps, then releasing it) that reveal duty vs. contamination by the stranger’s residue. The contradiction—keeper of light vs. carrier of borrowed memory—pressures her actions. The final renunciation costs personal memories on the page, earning the closing stance. Minor note: the psyche remains composed even at the apparition, but the restraint fits her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive (fulfilling his mother’s promise) is clear and sustained, and his tactile, map‑inflected perceptions individualize him. Contradictory impulses surface at the doorway—yearning to step versus accepting the cost of staying. His final renunciation (choosing clarity over alternate lives) feels earned by prior beats. The visible cost is the let‑go of 23 years of obsession and the lonely maps he’s curated as identity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear motive (erasure vs. memory) and a credible, costly choice anchor the arc; interiority is vivid and embodied (“air thinned into lace… each breath a stitch”). The contradiction—self-preservation vs. sacrifice—surfaces at the dais and resolves through Earned Stasis. Minor hedge: emotional conflict feels largely foregone once the shard reveals her future voice, slightly reducing on‑page struggle. Still, agency at the coronation/erasure moment reads earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corin’s interior conflict (quantifying presence vs. honoring it) is specific and embodied, and Mira applies relational pressure with subtext (“by returning differently”) that catalyzes his decisive act. The gesture of crushing a valuable pocket‑sun reads as a credible renunciation with cost and consequence to his self‑definition. Minor on‑the‑nose lines (“I’ve been selling absence”) slightly flatten complexity but don’t undercut motivation. The friendship‑turned‑intimacy functions as crucible and shifts their dynamic by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and contradictory: she both clings to narrative control and surrenders to erasure. Micro‑choices—feeding the stove, writing the soot line, stepping into moonlight, weighting the scroll—externalize motive under pressure. Jealousy of past selves and the professional duty to “distill chaos” sharpen a credible internal conflict. The Earned Stasis at the end feels motivated by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s yearning for meaning after anosmia is concrete and drives tactile, specific choices (loupe work, reorienting the clamp, telling Horace “It breathes now,” pocketing the screw). Interiority is character‑particular, avoiding labels and showing embodied conflict between loss and craft. The change is earned: she reframes purpose without regaining smell, with a felt cost. Minor ding: the late keepsake move risks undercutting her earlier choice to nest the clamp back in the base.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lina’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: she courts the superstition that once failed her to rework grief, even as terror “keeps her aloft.” Micro‑choices (holding breath through pain, racing the plume, sealing the twelfth stroke) align with her inner conflict. The cost is tangible (needled lungs, the quill’s fracture) and the renunciation at the end reads earned. Master Jomei’s presence adds crucible pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirage’s flaw—commodifying intimacy—drives every choice, from uncorking the bottle to the forbidden act of writing the confession. Contradictory impulses (performing vs. truly apologizing) are dramatized rather than told, and her renunciation of writing about this encounter lands with cost. The status dynamic with Julian shifts credibly as she yields control. A hairline ding: the self-advice-in-metaphor tick skirts mannerism without altering tactics much.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-POV interiority is vivid and particular, with embodied actions (counted steps, laying the book on the axis) aligned to a credible drive. Motivation—to unravel cosmic illusions before the hiccup ends—remains consistent and intensifies toward a costly surrender of memory and self. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (detached cartographer vs. naked motive), favoring lyric poise over friction. The renunciation at the end feels earned and forecloses identity with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Torvald’s motive—guarding memory and grasping what clocks measure—runs consistently from whistle to key-turn, with grief for his daughter giving it bite. His decisive act of reversing the master clock is earned by prior observation and ritual, and the cost is the dissolution of his role/self. Interiority is particular (key warmth, uphill water) rather than generic. A slight tendency to state realizations dampens some lived contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motivation (professional rigor braided to personal grief for Luc) is clear and consistently drives her micro‑choices, especially the decision to guide both Lucs into the spiral. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“quiet wildfire” in her pulse; spatial tingling). The internal contradiction—reclaim the “original” vs accept there is no original—is credible and active. Slightly fast conceptual leaps about the farm’s function are absorbed by the character’s established competence and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—“one rational, one reckless”—play on the page and motivate each turn from riding the loop to jumping the tracks to leaving the lantern burning. Her gambler/professor lineage informs tactics (reading scrawls like tells) and ethics (responsible widening). The renunciation costs her the talisman/father‑hunt but earns a reconfigured stance. Minor hedge: a few introspective lines risk neatness, but pressure keeps them honest.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and idiosyncratic; the operator’s cultivated estrangement collides with his curiosity and duty in scene. Key choices—staying on the line, meeting at the gate, handing over the disc, then cutting the wires—track cleanly to evolving motives. Contradictory impulses are dramatized at the gate and again when he lets the emergency call ring. The endurance/renunciation carries felt cost without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, embodied motive—an archivist preserving small moments—culminates in the costly, character‑specific choice to sacrifice her locket. The maternal undertow versus professional duty creates credible contradiction, especially when she presses the photo to the sketch and then relinquishes it. Micro‑choices under pressure (naming the boy, accelerating work, answering the guard) reveal values without sermonizing. The renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s “desperately jocular” masking reads specific and embodied through knock‑knock banter and the minor‑key whistle, and her micro‑choices (waiting, answering the loudspeaker, crushing the shard, boarding) align with motive. The reciprocity constraint forces her to seek and then trust the boy, revealing vulnerability. The boy’s “older than the timetables” presence adds pressure and a mirrored loneliness without flattening him. Cost is felt in her departure and in accepting a bond that doesn’t convert to obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular: he seeks the “stillpoint” to map his own blank interior, a fear he’s avoided for years. Interiority is embodied through synesthetic perception and the ring’s pressure, not labels. The decisive kneel, touch, and surrender of the ring’s hoarded language earns the change without tidy cure-all. Minor note: simultaneous contradictory impulses could surface a touch earlier on the path for peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives are clear and particular—she seeks to repair meaning while accepting uncertainty as method—and her choices (unbending the event, planting spiral-questions) arise credibly under pressure. The internal contradiction (“confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied her hand”) is dramatized rather than told. Cost is modest but present: power drain, gravity slackening, and the accepted burden of future echoes. Relationship pressure is mostly with the cosmos, not another person, keeping the crucible largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—return to a city that forgot her to “map silence until it becomes music”—is specific and consistently dramatized through micro‑choices (carrying an empty camera; refusing sound even while crying). Her internal contradiction (urge to capture vs. renunciation of preservation) is embodied in the no‑film camera and the mute composition. The advisor functions as relational pressure via signed questions and provocations. Cost is felt in her tearful, soundless endurance and the final self‑aimed click.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ember’s motive—rescuing a promise and reconciling her arson with preservation—is clear and consistent. Interiority is sensory and character-specific (lavender and sulfur; heat-warm threads), though the piece occasionally tells her realizations rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. The identity turn (arson as revelation) feels earned by the tapestry’s reweaving. Costs are more conceptual than visceral, but the final renunciation of “false repositories” reads.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motive—reclaiming/transforming her bond with Lila—drives concrete choices (the crescendo of drumming, the step into dissolution). Interiority is specific and embodied via tactile sound-making rather than label-speak. The internal contradiction (escape vs unity) is present but lightly handled. A slightly wider register of doubt or competing impulse in the final beats could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s competence, ear for walks, and tactile map‑work motivate clean, specific choices; the stranger’s legacy pressure is credible. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted—Mira adapts smoothly with little visible cost. Relationship dynamics are steady and respectful, not quite crucible‑hot. The final realization feels earned but largely conceptual rather than wrested through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular: she must teach darkness to value stars, and she does so through micro‑choices (adjusting shutters by fractions, resisting the urge to speak). The internal contradiction—“the secret pressed... wanting to be spoken” versus her chosen silence—generates lived tension. Backstory (the canal took her voice) personalizes the cost and informs present tactics. The earned stasis at dawn feels credible: she accepts the daily reweaving despite fatigue and forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and embodied, and her agency drives the night’s transformation. Interiority is specific (hearing the pieces’ unspoken wishes), though she faces little inner contradiction or visible cost. Ellis adds pressure symbolically rather than adversarially. The ending shows a credible endurance/renunciation of fixed play, but the emotional price is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motives (duty vs motion) are concrete and embodied in choices: building the raft from bayonet hilts, refusing the council, and unmaking the harpoon. Her interiority is particular and sensory (scrimshaw vibrating against her sternum). The final renunciation carries cost (leaving community and role) and reads earned. Minor note: the council pressure is brief, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The performer’s motives—cultivating lightness within a punitive hush—are specific and embodied through whittling, logging sounds as “dirge,” and the choice to plant the stripped bouquet. Her moral ambiguity is dramatized (former informer and forger), not merely stated, and it informs her risk-taking under surveillance. The relationship with the ex-officer shifts status on the porch, creating a credible, quiet alliance. Minor limitation: interiority leans lyric-conceptual over visceral at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Her motive—to paraphrase law and unseal the lake—is clear and enacted through tactile choices (pressing quartz, altering a phoneme, stepping onto the thawing surface). Interiority is particular and embodied (heartbeat harmonizing with pillars), with a credible risk framed (“mispronounced” freezing). Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers beyond one pause to “listen,” so struggle feels more aesthetic than morally or emotionally torn. Still, the final renunciations (self‑erasure into rumor) register as a cost scaled to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Milo’s drive (to capture a color he’s never seen) is embodied in concrete choices—accepting the marble eye, guiding Rosa, smashing the work, finally renouncing painting. Interiority lands viscerally when the eye shows him “the violence of it,” making the change earned. The relationship with Rosa functions as crucible via the barter and the plant‑arrangement dialogue. Minor distance from Milo during a few summarizing passages slightly reduces intensity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, compelling interior drive (her bells no longer ring true) and active, value‑revealing choices (publicly questioning, arranging the spiral, singing, leaving the lens) land. Contradictory impulses—mourning versus transformation—are present but lightly contested; the collectors offer little resistance, softening crucible pressure. Embodied touches (the cracked lens’s “powerfully gentle” weight) help anchor feeling. Minor didactic tilt edges toward tidy insight.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is specific and tactile—her folding, dissolving vellum, and hairwork ground grief in embodied choice. The arc from preservational obsession to acceptance feels earned by the final renunciation (leaving). Internal contradiction (clinging vs. releasing) is present but sometimes explained more than dramatized. Still, the micro-choices (where to place each figure; using the stencil itself) credibly reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single‑POV interiority is vivid and specific; her choices (vectorizing the deck, taping a grid, translating thunder) reveal a distinctive mind under pressure. Motivation—to “reverse engineer the culture”—is consistent and drives her tactile methods. Internal conflict is quieter; the piece favors steadied obsession over contradictory impulses, which slightly limits heat. The culminating renunciation (sealing the tools, leaving a “ghost protocol”) reads earned, with a felt cost in isolation and futility.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, consistent motive (purify the archive) deepens into a credible inner contradiction: purification threatens erasure of self. Embodied pressure appears in tactile details (sweat in the veil, copper‑tasting corridors) and micro‑choices (refusing patterns; choosing exit; later teaching). The shift from solitary purifier to communal rememberer reads earned and costly. Slight distance from other on‑page characters limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s motive is crystal—preserving the unshareable shape of hope—and every micro‑choice escalates it: threading reels, setting the stone between projectors, choosing not to drop it, then internalizing and finally locking it away. Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release; share vs. protect) act simultaneously in the balcony beat. The daughter‑driven revelation (“not a scholar’s quest but a daughter’s promise”) earns the final renunciation. The cost—becoming the last dusk and locking her shadow away—lands as a credible, paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Miren’s conflicting drives—care for Aster versus dismantling her pride—are embodied in concrete, escalating micro-choices (ring removed, braid unpinned, lecture burned). Her reactions are tactile and specific, avoiding abstraction. The final act of release reads as a costly renunciation rather than tidy triumph. The character remains flawed and newly doubtful, which deepens authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—she seeks closure by “reading” scars and pays the price by reopening the wound. Interiority is embodied (iron and lilac, throat scrape) and character‑specific. The decisive act (“Trade requires fresh loss” → she bleeds) is earned and alters her stance. Minor ambiguity about contradictory impulses exists but grief’s pull serves as the credible driver.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive is clear and consistently pursued, and her agency drives the key turns (choosing psychometry; scratching lyrics onto the film). Interiority is vivid and embodied through cinema‑specific perception. The change—moving from seeking to releasing—is credible and earned. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is muted; the path feels relatively smooth emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is vivid and pressure-specific: she must “remember stardust” or risk soul-colorblindness for future artists, and her choices escalate to self‑sacrifice. Interiority is concrete (frost on the latitude scale, migraine of unborn constellations) with a credible wound (teachers’ scissors) fueling present action. The contradiction—reverence for instruments vs. dismantling them—is dramatized, not told. Global stakes flirt with melodrama but remain embodied through her micro‑moves.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.7)
    The guard’s motive—preserve and deliver the children’s “sparks” by ritual duty—is clear and enacted through specific choices (naming, placing the clock, burying it). Interiority is implied via training and embodied acts rather than explicit reflection, which suits the “dreamless” trait but limits layered contradiction. His renunciation of the clock reads as a credible cost. A deeper clash between duty and desire would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is vivid and coherent—she wants to “rediscover the wild frontier of your mind,” yet fears losing identity, crystallized at the drop‑the‑gear moment. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously (“She hesitated; without the gear she might forget her name entirely”). Actions align with pressure, and the renunciation carries felt cost and a before/after. Interiority remains concrete and character‑particular, embodied through tactile details (oil and cinnamon) rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivations are clear (restore the crossing, soothe the hound), and Jun’s decisive stamping action aligns with their “gently persistent” trait. Interiority is light; Marta’s wisdom largely manifests as pronouncements rather than tension between impulses. The hound’s arc is sketched but effective; the guides’ internal costs are muted. Still, actions emerge coherently from character and culminate in a credible reconfiguration of the guardian relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bellhop’s drive—to gauge the price of safety—anchors every choice, from pressing the bolt into the boy’s palm to his disciplined stillness outside the ward. Interiority is embodied and specific (iron taste, frost on lashes), with credible contradiction: he obeys silence while aching for song. The Earned Stasis at the end (remaining as sentinel) forecloses speech with felt cost. Relationship pressure with the boy and surgeon is clean and alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—precision and balance—driving concrete micro‑choices (cryptic marginalia, the whisper, the final flick). Interiority is restrained but character‑particular; the “regally unpretentious” stance shows in action rather than labels. Limited contradiction or strain under pressure keeps it shy of the absolute top. The pretender’s pride is dramatized effectively as counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s duty-bound, grief-tempered motivation is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (prying the panel, launching the sub, inserting the page). Interiority is textured and embodied without therapy-speak. The contradiction—witness of loss versus keeper of a way back—lands at closure. Slight ease in decoding the mystery keeps it short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motivation (“discover meaning… keep the sky open”) drives concrete micro‑choices: climb the crane, duet with the stones, ignite the pad, broadcast instead of escape. Interiority feels specific (hum in arches/sternum) with a credible contradiction (“awkwardly confident”). The final renunciation of simple escape for a riskier, communal act reads earned. Slight lack of on‑page fear or hesitation undercuts felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Nara’s motive is crystalline and rooted in lived contradictions: insurgent tenderness versus ruthless pragmatism. Her micro-choices under pressure (reading the kite through plants, nicking the sac despite danger, weaponizing moss) reveal value hierarchy and embodied cost (knees, risk, secrecy). Interiority is shown through tactile vows and plant‑mediated perception, not labels. The guard’s brief presence adds immediate pressure without diluting Nara’s central drive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied, with contradictory impulses (clinging to the photo vs. releasing it) driving micro‑choices. The “somatic markers” motif risks clinical diction but is grounded in tactile action and cost. The final covenant reads as an earned endurance that forecloses a path (endless memorializing by the photo). Reactions to trees, resin, and scents reveal character under pressure with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motive—restore a lost face through art—drives concrete choices (reassembling cards, stepping through the mirror). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“redesign the very grammar of seeing”). Contradictory impulses—yearning for her vs. accepting absence as pigment—coexist and culminate in an earned, costly choice. Minor hedge: relationship pressure is off‑page, so crucible work relies entirely on objects and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive is clear and sustained—find Lyra and answer the temporal riddle—culminating in a costly, active choice to step through the portal. The “serene anger” is embodied in disciplined, tactile tracking and careful use of tools. Internal contradiction (anger vs. acceptance) appears, but could be deepened with one sharper moment of hesitation under pressure. Secondary relationship (Lyra) drives him, though on‑page relational pressure is mostly mediated via artifacts and a brief portal exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sera’s motives are clear and intensify under pressure: preserve truth versus protect the archive. Contradictory impulses act on the page—fear of mob destruction alongside the decision to leak. Micro-choices reveal values (slipping the letter into her sleeve; choosing the maintenance hatch; re-entering the pod). The Earned Stasis at closure (“If you burn, I will burn with you”) carries visible cost and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character-specific motivation (weaving violent legacy into a peace-garden) with embodied perception and micro-choices (lifting the canvas, sheathing, planting). The pacifist/violent inheritance tension is vivid but largely uncontested on the page, keeping the cost subtle. Interiority is textured (engraved quiet as pressure), though the emotional path is a touch pre-decided. The final acceptance reads earned, if gently so.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and character‑particular (cool‑headed hunter who “voices silence”), and her decisive act with the spike aligns with her temperament. The demand to “show me your cry” sets a credible internal pressure point, but the contradictory impulses (cry vs. silence) stay mostly implicit. Interiority is distilled more into image than felt, embodied struggle, so the cost reads as conceptual rather than viscerally lived. Still, her micro‑choices under pressure reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cordelia’s motive (to reweight truth and end the “orbit of regret”) is clear, persistent, and drives concrete choices. Her internal contradiction—heir to lies yet author of correction—plays in the act of inscribing logical negations until the cherished tool breaks. The cost is legible (breaking the rosewood nib; surrendering a self-definition) and alters her stance. Orlan provides light pressure and contrast without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, consistent motivation rooted in guilt propels concrete choices (RESTORE, then RELEASE INSECT). Interiority is embodied through object interactions (amber, stylus, letters) rather than labels. A credible internal tension appears at the final menu (BECOME LULLABY vs RELEASE), with a felt renunciation. Cost is present but a shade soft because she avoids the starkest sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s motive—seeking meaning in impermanence—is clear and embodied through specific acts (kneeling, raking, sweeping a spiral into a straight line). Her interiority is concrete (“meaning felt like chalk dust on her tongue”) and her socially perceptive restraint modulates her choices. The decisive refusal of eternity and the flinging of the mandala read as earned, with the cost of erasing her life’s work present on the page. The conflict remains mostly internal, but contradictions (wanting meaning vs. rejecting fixity) are dramatized, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Asha’s contradictory impulses—former universalist vs. the hard mercy of forgetting—are dramatized through tactile, specific choices (forty-nine tesserae; releasing named memories). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, anchored in the embodied act of rebuilding a mosaic. The renunciation (taking the stone, leaving) forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor telling creeps in but is grounded by action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Casper’s need for applause/possibility is concrete and governs each micro‑choice (coin to chest, flip, tying thread, walking the stage). Interiority is sensorially particular rather than labeled, and his collaboration with Lila reveals a lived relationship under pressure. The change—his outline sharpening and carrying an “endless encore”—reads as an earned reconfiguration. Slightly limited by minimal on‑page contradiction beyond want vs despair.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s “affectionate skepticism” is concrete, embodied in her reflexive rationalizing and later shift to acceptance; her choice to “devise a new pattern” for healing shows credible agency. Interiority stays character‑specific (scientific bent, camera craft) with tangible bodily cues. Minor on‑the‑nose lines (“because they worked too well”) flatten mystery. Secondary figures function as pressures via telepathic impressions rather than direct interaction, which limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aera’s motive—becoming “the voice of the unknown”—is clear and drives her choices, especially the risky decision to press the fossil to her sternum. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ache older than grammar,” collapse after singing weather). The internal contradiction (curiosity/compulsion vs. risk of self-erasure) is present but could be sharpened. The change—allowing the unknown to speak through her—feels earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motive (to “unscramble” a leaking prophecy) and a tactile method (cataloging buttons) reveal character through choice. Interiority is embodied via sensory bias and occupational detail, not labels. Internal contradiction is light—resolve comes without much pushback—so cost reads more conceptual than felt. The renunciation of tower duty (“not to turn the glass but to offer the jar”) lands as a credible, if gently priced, shift.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Motivation is crystalline—guilt and a late-blooming need to repair harm drive every micro‑choice from decoding the snow to crushing the pillbox. Interiority is embodied (scarred nerves, iron taste, bleeding knee) and avoids therapy‑speak. Contradictory impulses (prudent craft vs. daring exposure) are dramatized rather than labeled. The renunciation at the end (destroying his legend) carries visible cost and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: fulfill the palimpsest promise under the ticking clock and accept the cost. Interiority is conveyed through tactile, image-led choices (tingling seat, cupping the sphere). The coachman’s acceptance is swift—little explicit contradiction or hesitation—so the arc reads more consenting than contested. Still, the renunciation of identity (coachman to walker with a drop under his tongue) lands credibly with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lin’s motive—tending and testing whether kindness can reanimate a place—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (rolling the clay hive, aligning the lantern glass). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific, filtered through a potter’s sensibility. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little genuine resistance and remains serenely competent. The endurance cost (leaving, accepting the oasis’s impermanence) lands but without much on‑page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motives are clear and textured: a fines-savvy, rule-bending caretaker who steals a tool to keep a promise. Her contradictory impulses—risk-averse pragmatism vs. transgressive compassion—operate simultaneously and drive action. Embodied choices (kneeling with the petal; guiding the boy; surrendering the tool) reveal hierarchy of values with cost. The boy’s presence tightens her stance without head‑hopping or sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—she seeks the hum to keep her “brittle awakening” from cracking, trading communal memory for momentum. The decisive choice at the henge (company vs. self) is earned by prior setup and carries felt cost. Interiority is embodied through tactile images (gnomon mirroring every cell), though contradictory impulses remain more implied than dramatized in real time. Secondary presence (archivist) applies slight pressure but remains peripheral.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation (to rejoin the thread and reclaim authorship) is clear and embodied through tactile micro‑choices (kneeling to write for the elderly woman; placing the twig spiral in the bronze throat). The internal contradiction—serving others’ longing vs. claiming her own—animates the piece and culminates in a credible renunciation. Secondary figures apply soft, thematic pressure rather than direct opposition, keeping conflict largely internal. The decisive shift to sign her own name feels earned, if gently won.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mara’s motive and through‑line are clear and consistent, but much of her interiority is summarized rather than dramatized. We get a few embodied beats (“fingers trembled”), yet contradictory impulses under peak pressure rarely collide on the page. The final choice reads earned, though the cost stays mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arin’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a claustrophobe who chooses descent and stays through panic because the key matters. Embodied detail (counted breaths, humming shanties, wool‑thick air) underwrites her internal conflict. Micro‑choices—planting the compass, stepping into the circle, accepting the bargain—track cleanly to character. The cost (tunnels closing; fear transformed) feels earned rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (solve the quarry disappearances/awaken empathy) drives concrete, character-specific tactics: cross-referencing rentals, mixing ribbon fibers into pigment, and the final delivery to the sheriff. Interiority is embodied through sensory noticing and process rather than labels. A credible inner contradiction—needing to forgive her face-blindness while forcing recognition—surfaces at the peak. Relationship pressure is minimal, but single-POV micro-choices under stress are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive is precise and embodied—honoring Edda against institutional erasure—and her choices (self‑exile, decoding, confronting Voss, choosing to stay) align. Interiority is vivid via tactile motifs (copper nail, kelp‑stink) and work‑specific habits (singing coded lullabies). The relationship with Voss creates a credible crucible that shifts status on the page. A slight convenience in Voss’s quick alignment trims some friction but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, specific interiority and motive (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) drive concrete choices: to play, to translate wind, to crush the flake, to take his hand. Contradictory impulses—fear from her father’s fall vs. reaching toward the hitchhiker—are dramatized at the climax. The emotional texture feels embodied via tool use (bow, violin, glass), not diagnostic labels. Minor limitation: lyricism sometimes buffers raw struggle, softening friction in mid‑beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (glass crunch, mildew popcorn, portraits on banknotes “asking” him), and micro‑choices (placing notes as markers, leaving the satchel open) reveal values under pressure. The father’s legacy complicates motive without neat absolution. The renunciation at the end reads earned with a felt cost. Minor hedge: conflict remains largely internal, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—she must witness and translate before the star dims—and her realization that she is “the chronicled” reframes her healing power with personal cost. Interiority is concrete through object work (petal‑syllables, telescope, vellum) and the boy’s late naming marks a relational turn. The main softness: conflict resolves with minimal resistance; her gift faces grief but little pushback or error. Still, the renunciation of solitary bearing (shared burden) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Briar’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a guarded finder of lost things who seeks absolution yet fears being consumed. Her micro-choices (pressing the flesh-eating seed to her wrist; choosing to kneel and confess) align with traits and escalate cost. The embodied confession (“words scraping out like blades”) earns the shift without safety hedging. Slight holdback: consequences beyond the lake are deferred, tempering the magnitude of the on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority (“kite string pulled by two storms”) and a consistent motivation (curiosity) drive concrete micro‑choices: pressing the clipping to a scar, refusing pruning/grafting, and protecting the bloom. Contradictory impulses are embodied and persist through the gardener’s test. The final stance (choosing the “now that grows between them”) reads earned with a mild, felt cost (accepting a wound as root). Relationship pressure via the gardener is brief but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, character‑particular motives (to patch war‑torn memory) meet an embodied, fraught choice when Lira demands the mother’s hum. The narrator’s hesitation and surrender are credible, with felt cost that alters their relationship from client to witness. Lira’s “fiercely gentle” idealism applies pressure and suffers visible consequence (she sags, hollowed). The micro‑choices (what to trade, whether to attempt reversal) reveal a hierarchy of values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (hoarding the cloth vs. wanting to toss it) dramatized in scene. Her competence and shame coexist credibly, and the final choice to call the school is earned by the orange-speck memory turn. Actions align with motives across beats, and the cost (risking exposure after public failure) is felt. Secondary character pressure is minimal but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motives (reestablish the archive, decipher “physics of transition”) are clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices—mapping the arbor’s clicks, planting the seed, humming the lullaby. Her kindly, methodical temperament constrains tactics rather than serving as a label. The grief thread (mother’s disappearance) complicates her task and culminates in accepting a pattern over a body. The cost is largely emotional, not decisional, but it reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motivation (“preserve wonder in routine”) drives concrete choices (smelting, planting the creel). Interiority is specific to her hybrid body and work; the litany reveals lived contradiction rather than tidy epiphany. The resistance of identities offers mild on‑page friction, though the struggle resolves without much costed hesitation. Lacks a relational crucible, but the self‑division functions as a credible internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motives are clear and particular (an inspector fleeing sirens to witness what stone remembers), and her confession crystallizes a credible contradiction—fear of living rooms versus devotion to tombs. Micro-choices—entering the unlisted bunker, pressing the pearl to the wall, accepting the crown—track cleanly with her need. The transformation into witness/caretaker carries a visible cost (abandoning her convoyed life). Minor note: her leap to accept the crown is swift but prefigured enough by the pearl’s insistence and vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dense, embodied interiority with credible contradiction (maps vs. visions; penance vs. defiance) drives concrete micro-choices: playing the accordion as testimony, copying graffiti, launching the paper boat, and the renunciatory air-release. The father’s death guilt is dramatized rather than summarized, and the forgiveness of the twelve-year-old reads earned. Minor safety lines (“latitude of regret, longitude of silence”) flirt with tidy conceit but don’t undercut motivation. The endurance choice forecloses a path (perpetual penance via mapping-as-atonement) with visible cost (withdrawal, relinquishment).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive (“to document the library of unspoken words”) drive concrete choices: unsaying her first lie, offering the lullaby, seizing the syllable. Contradictory impulses (“cautious exuberance”) are embodied and pressured by the watch’s rules. The costed trade (mother’s lullaby) reveals values under stress. Slight distance from deeper personal history limits the emotional bleed-through at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motives and contradictions are vivid: duty to provenance versus a refusal to be co-opted; play, smash, or sing as competing impulses. Interiority is sensorily embodied (mulberries, brass, the melting string). Her choice to sing reads as earned by the coffee-map fracture and the commodified “Rebellion Lite” vision. The cost registers in her disappearance and the foreclosed mute-garden/tyrannical-perfection paths.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and specific from the first line to the final renunciation, with tactile occupational detail grounding her choices. The internal turn—realizing the spark is her own—feels earned by prior pattern‑work. Slight softness: the sacrifice arrives with minimal on‑page resistance, trading messier contradiction for lyric inevitability. Still, embodied images (sable wand of her own hair, cooling skin) reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear (fleeing upward after forgiveness to seek contentment) and evolves into a hard-earned decision to descend and tend the wound. Contradictory impulses (escape vs. responsibility) are dramatized in the stab of the hairpin and the later descent. Embodied emotion is specific (“knees scallop inward,” sap sealing the lifeline). Relationship pressure with the sister lands credibly at the gate and transforms by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s profession, embodied sensitivity, and fatigue are specific and credible; her micro‑choice to refuse anesthetizing their guilt and instead offer a naked choice reads earned. Interiority is tactile (trembling hands, “cloak of doubt”) and not therapy‑speak. The geologist’s reaction is sketched but effective as a crucible for her stance. Slight safety hedge: the team’s collective psychology remains idealized, avoiding a sharper, individuated counterforce on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to teach while vanishing) is clear and enacted, with the concrete choice to drop the stone as her last act; the cost lands as she regresses and disappears. Marcus’s interiority is thinner—he mostly observes—so relationship pressure and micro‑choices are limited. Embodiment is present (magnetic pull, voice changing), but internal contradiction is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The final endurance/renunciation reads earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: find and fuse with the “wandering pulse” by learning to “navigate without moving.” Interiority is textured and embodied (teeth ache, arrowhead warms), but internal contradiction is mild; he moves steadily toward surrender rather than wrestling with competing impulses. Micro‑choices—listening, singing in harmonics, pressing the arrowhead to his chest—track with his goal. The change lands, though the felt cost of renunciation is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—rejecting packaged miracles to seek the sacred in the simple—is precise and drives every choice (unstrapping bands, mist walking, plucking one petal, mailing it). The contradiction of removing then re‑strapping the bands reads as earned ambivalence rather than a reset. Emotions are embodied (frost scars healing “without drama,” the petal’s warmth) and specific. Slight limitation: external pressure is largely systemic rather than interpersonal, reducing crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jin’s motive is clear and particular—he’s hunted the color of sound—and his choices (leaving the ladder, diving, handling air pockets, playing/sealing the cylinder, returning to light) align with that drive. Interiority is sensorially embodied (e.g., vermilion flare from the lily), with profession‑specific detail grounding him. Internal contradiction is lighter—duty vs. obsession is present but not sharply contested on the page. The ending’s renunciation/return reads earned though the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive—“to wavelength align with purpose”—is persistent, embodied in procedural micro‑choices (arranging, pressing, listening) under rising pressure. Contradictory impulses (quiet enthusiasm vs. “stellar doubt”) operate simultaneously rather than alternating. The culminating renunciation (stepping onto the plate) is earned by the prophecy’s reweighting and the coins’ apologies. A hairline note: the interior label “receipt” edges toward abstraction, but her actions keep it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reaper’s need “to name the nameless fear” is clear and drives concrete choices (tracing the atlas, shattering cylinders, folding souls). Interiority is embodied through tactile images (frosted fingertip, copper pooling) rather than labels. His realization of complicity produces a credible turn without tidy absolution. Minor reservation: contradictory impulses could surface with one more on‑page hesitation before he acts.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motive—quiet devotion to restore the sea—drives concrete micro-choices (hanging the bell at first light, counting, staying seven days, becoming the keeper). Interiority is conveyed through embodied ritual and tears rather than labels. The contradiction is modest (lukewarm magic vs. grand aim), but he endures rather than wrestles with a thorny inner conflict. The visible cost lands in his lifelong vigil and death.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol’s motives (duty vs. private grief) are clear and enacted through concrete choices—pocketing the label, following the photo-trail, tearing the label, then reframing the town via her own photographs. Her interiority feels specific (anise and rain; “precisely humane”) and contradictions live on the page. The final renunciation carries cost and fits her character’s ethic. Only slight neatness to the resolution keeps it shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is explicit and embodied—the quest to reconcile logic and awe threads every choice, culminating in the risky melting of the crystal. Interiority is textured (singing prime numbers to heal a starling; the ribbon dyed with “indigo and grief”). The contradiction between rational constraint and devotional impulse is dramatized rather than told. Slight thesis-forward phrasing surfaces at times, but it’s earned by the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile engagement with the buckle, the radio, and the penlight renders motive under pressure. Contradictory impulses (guard vs. release; vigilance vs. relinquishment) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation (handing over the buckle) forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor neatness in self‑recognition/mask beat skirts convenience but remains thematically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive (to defeat numbness and save the child/self) is concrete and pressures each confession, while Zero’s resignation counters her attachment in a credible, character-driven crucible. Interiority is specific (“tasting color,” “weight of absolute silence”) and actions align with motive, culminating in the bold merge. The relationship dynamic escalates authentically with status shifts (his falter, her reach). The final synthesis feels earned with visible cost: the disappearance of both singular selves.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent: protect her haven and guests while honoring innovation. Her choices (planting, then actively guiding the growth) align with that drive and reveal competence under pressure. Internal conflict—control vs. surrender—is present but lightly dramatized, with limited on‑page cost. More embodied contradiction at the planting beat could deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ellery’s motive is clear and particular—coaxing his dead daughter’s laughter back through sound—and his micro‑choices (throttle modulation, kneeling, whispering to the hourglass) embody grief and hope simultaneously. Contradictory impulses (“impossible and familiar”) act in scene, not in summary. The renunciation at the end—accepting absence shaped by echo—feels earned with felt cost. Relationship pressure is present via the wife’s distant chuckle reshaping the household’s emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and particular, with credible contradictory impulses (guardian vs. feral, paw vs. hand) driving micro‑choices like licking the sundial and yielding to being “interiorized.” Motivation—learning to “wait within the questions” and befriend uncertainty—intensifies and culminates in a costly self‑redefinition. The emotional turn is earned through repeated tactile engagements (rose, perimeter, sundial) rather than abstract declaration. A slight remove from concrete interpersonal pressure keeps the crucible purely internal, limiting ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motives are clear and consistent: he steals the crozier to disrupt imposed destiny and pays by relinquishing sight. Interiority is vivid and embodied (blood counted “like decades,” hearing “frequencies of faith”), with a credible blend of resolve and doubt. The sacrifice of the goggles is an earned renunciation that forecloses ease and hedging. Minor note: the “hopeless” label tilts toward posture rather than dramatized inner contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, character‑specific motive (“find the beginning in every ending”) guides credible micro‑choices under pressure (unscrewing the hatch, discarding assumptions, feeding the fragment). Interiority is embodied through tactile craft details and the “serenely electric” sensations rather than abstract labels. The change is earned: she reframes the shard from threat to cocoon and sacrifices the star fragment. Slight softness: near‑frictionless competence reduces visible struggle in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arden’s motives are clear and compelling—save the flickering commuters and find a dock that remembers him—grounded in his resilient optimism and grief. His contradictory impulses surface at the price beat (“one timeline must be poured into the other”) and his refusal-laugh reads as character-specific defiance. The final Earned Stasis—choosing a “permanent transient” life—feels like a credible cost. Slight softness remains where his double-flip seems to outmaneuver the binary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear, consistent drive—she enters to “discover the texture of connection”—and acts via weaving, with an earned internal shift at the end. However, interior conflict is limited; she rarely falters or faces contradiction beyond awe. The composite man applies light pressure, but the protagonist remains largely competent and unopposed. Cost is present (spool emptied; dissolution) but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The instructor’s motives (teach, preserve direction under grief) are clear and deepen via micro‑choices: telling the truth to the boy, keeping him after class, and surrendering the relic. Her interior contradiction—grief vs. duty—surfaces in “She almost lied,” then resolves into an earned endurance. The boy’s fear/desire dynamic sharpens the crucible. Cost is embodied in “fingers bled rust” and the relinquished chain link.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motives and methods are clear and particular, with embodied perception (“air tasted of iron and lilies”) anchoring her interiority. Her micro‑choices—following the pulse, aligning the photo, handing it over—track with her calling. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a visible interpersonal price. Still, the vocation’s cost surfaces at the end (the aid falls silent), earning a modest but real change.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive—to stand by the unremembered—meets a credible inner antagonist in her claustrophobia, which the text embodies through basalt “throat” and brine-thickened air. Micro‑choices (naming Sato, placing her glove over Voss’s) reveal values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete and character‑particular, avoiding label‑speak. Slight safety: aside from fear, flaws and conflicting desires remain narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and particular, with embodied details like the “soft mechanical tick inside my ribs” grounding motive and fear. The goal—to fetch wisdom and reenter flesh before dawn—drives concrete micro‑choices (ink map, stepping into the ring, facing the clerk). Contradictory impulses (stay in spectral safety vs. risk reassembly and exposure) surface in the snow’s Morse “stay” beat. A slight drift into aphoristic articulation softens the grit of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-POV desire is precise and embodied: she fears the curse but fears silence more, and her micro‑choices escalate from listening to speaking to swallowing the diamond. Interiority is conveyed through tactile lexicon (texture→sound) rather than label‑speak. Contradictory impulses (self‑preservation vs. cultural preservation) operate simultaneously. Slight lyric distance keeps some psychological nuance abstract, but the sacrifice lands credibly with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vale’s motive (find the wraith/mentor, manage bitterness) is clear and her micro‑choices—taking the phone, accepting the mentor’s reframe, stepping into the garden’s center—credibly lead to metamorphosis. Interiority is vivid and embodied (arrowhead warmth, buoyant sorrow), though the internal contradiction (hunt vs. surrender) resolves a touch smoothly. The herbalist applies light but relevant pressure without stealing focus. The cost—abandoning her old life—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Calla’s motive and tactics are clear and character‑specific (music as agency; the shell as memory), with embodied perception (“tasted of iron and apricot”). Internal contradiction is present but light—the “gap between knowing and understanding” is evocative yet doesn’t force a fraught trade‑off. Her competence borders on ease, so struggle is brief and cost is mainly relinquishment (shell dissolves, bridge gone) rather than a bruising moral price. Still, micro‑choices under pressure (skipping every fourth beat; playing the lullaby backward; uprooting the seed) feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear motive (redressing broken promises) drives precise, risky choices, and “respectfully rebellious” is enacted rather than labeled. Interiority is concrete and object‑filtered (heron, storm bottle), though internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized. The endurance stance at the end (“emptiness itself can be a message”) reads as earned stasis. Minor ding: we don’t see a sharp on‑page emotional cost paid beyond risk and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he disbelieves the myth yet is compelled to “interpret silence as possibility.” Interiority is embodied through tactile craft memory and the ache of swallowed words. The turn to sing without mouth is earned by his life’s quiet persistence, and the choice to “take a wrong turn on purpose” forecloses a past path. Cost is subtle but felt as renunciation and reorientation rather than triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    Calla’s goal is clear and embodied through concrete micro‑choices (drawer, envelope, spoken call mark, tearing the scarf). Her interiority is specific and character‑particular, with occupational texture informing perception. The cost—surrendering the scarf/time—lands credibly. Slight softness: conflict is mostly internal with limited contradictory impulses dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mireya’s motive is vivid and consistent, and her choices (setting out before dawn, using palette and camera despite the horizon’s price) drive the action. Interiority is largely lyric rather than conflicted; we get little genuine tug-of-war beyond a declared willingness to risk an unnamed memory. Embodied emotion appears in charged images (“the air grew thinner… the gap between heartbeats”) more than concrete physical stress. The endurance at the end reads earned but the felt personal cost remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith’s motive—freeing a fragile idea from fear—is clear and consistent, and his tactic shifts (silence-song, tracing stitches, backward stepping) reveal a calm, unshowy boldness under pressure. Interiority is conveyed through image rather than thought, which suits the mode but limits contradiction on the page. The micro‑turn when the mouth won’t open tests resolve credibly. Cost is largely conceptual (carrying secrets as music), not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive (recovering stolen memories) is vivid, consistent, and compels action; her “chronically curious” trait grounds tool use and risk. The internal contradiction—temptation to complete the forgetting versus the counter‑move with the scalpel—reads on the page. Interiority is embodied via sensory and craft detail (salt‑crystal leaves, swollen journal). The final renunciation feels earned, though the on‑page cost is more conceptual than scarring.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (refusing to forget), embodied contradictions (save the library vs. not becoming a text), and micro‑choices under pressure (reading, sealing clauses, mentoring without words) build to an earned endurance. The cost—bearing memory and remaining in service—reads without overstatement. The child’s arrival productively tests her stance. Slight remove from deep interior feeling keeps it just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arin’s motive (preserve wonder) is concrete and consistent, and his choices (build, capture, then release) align under pressure. The decisive renunciation—“the loom was not a cage but a shuttle”—earns the turn and carries cost (collapse, aging, relinquishing the orchard). Interiority is embodied through craft-detail and sensory bias rather than labels. Minor limitation: the internal push‑pull before the release choice could show a touch more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mirel’s motivation is precise and pressured: a professional compulsion to “ground restless spirits” set against a dawning belief that her work cages them. Interiority is embodied (heartbeat as a muffled knock; silence rising like tide) and contradictions are active in-scene. The final renunciation (“I will no longer mend prisons”) is both ethically and vocationally costly and earned by prior beats. No safety‑hedging; her choice forecloses a life path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—reopening the henge mystery by listening rather than conquering—is clear and deepens into a credible renunciation. Micro‑choices (frame‑matching the films, walking out in rain, stepping into the ring, then waiting without demand) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is embodied and particular (“spirals that drank sound,” “second heartbeat”). The shift to “room for mystery rather than mastery” reads earned with an implied cost of surrendering totalizing control.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “quietly analytic” lens drives concrete actions (measuring decay, formulating a hypothesis, recording a conclusion) and the renunciation with the snow globe, revealing conflict between duty to the lost and the need to release. Embodied choices—unscrewing the globe, swapping contents—externalize her internal stakes. The relationship with Fred (Death) adds pressure through presence and earned restraint rather than directives. Minor hedge: Mara’s climactic insight is highly articulate, skirting over-tidiness but remains character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s motive—articulating unspoken needs before thunder—drives clear micro-choices (kneeling to paint, resisting the echo, then releasing the petals). The echo externalizes her contradiction (preserve vs. release) and pressures a genuine shift. Embodied detail (metal taste, trembling hand) grounds emotion. Slightly told motivations (“Lyra’s motivation was simple”) keep this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s curiosity and care drive concrete micro-choices (putting on the goggles, aligning pages, choosing descent, trading the thimble) that reveal values under pressure. Her contradictions—drawn to grief’s artifacts yet orienting toward joy—are dramatized rather than stated. The final renunciation (not reporting, adopting the gardener’s role) feels earned and carries cost. A minor softness is the limited on‑page pushback from other characters.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—preserving sky‑memory and her mother’s work—is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (threading the filament, logging emotions, releasing kites, stepping out) align under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“tastes like burnt coffee and airport goodbyes”). Internal contradiction is present though subtle: she claims not to fear the fall yet scrambles to prevent forgetting, which drives urgency. A touch more on the personal cost of leaving life behind would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, idiosyncratic interiority—her prosopagnosia shapes how she notices shoulders, hands, negative space—and her micro-choices under pressure (coin-to-wall transfers, pigment calculations) feel earned. The contradiction between monastic precision and the demolition clock registers credibly. Her final renunciation—leaving the work to survive without her—lands as an earned stance. A touch of thesis‑speak (“limitation is not failure but filter”) trims some mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motive and interiority are clear and character‑particular, with her curiosity driving concrete micro‑choices (cargo deck investigation; copying spirals; reading the dialects). The loneliness/belonging tension hums beneath actions without being over‑stated. However, the fix arrives a touch conveniently via the engineer’s prompt, softening visible cost and struggle. The relationship shift with Rooth is earned but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rowan’s motive—learning the “rhythm of repair”—is clear, embodied, and drives every micro‑choice under pressure. His doubt and grief complicate competence, culminating in a costly choice to step through and accept a new role. Interiority is precise and character‑particular, not generic. Slight safety lies in the near‑tidy emotional calibration at the end, but the cost (door sealed, past foreclosed) keeps it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s altruism, doubt, and tactical tenderness (“she circled the canopy…only when hands below were ready to catch”) create a credible, motivated arc toward release. Interiority is shown through embodied, specific acts (frost‑letters, counterweighting) rather than labels. Kai’s responses deepen the relational crucible without stealing focus. The visible cost—accepting departure once the community can stand—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation and inner conflict are vivid and embodied: she arrives to save the world yet is destabilized by the puppet head from her “first life.” Micro‑choices (kneeling, pressing the head to her collarbone, looping the lullaby) escalate with cost. The acceptance to remain whispering forever reads as an earned renunciation tied to her history. Slight abstraction at times but still character‑particular and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motive—duty-bound rescue despite hatred of the orchard—is clear and deepens under pressure. Contradictory impulses (“she hated the orchard” vs. “graceless beauty of saving strangers”) act in scene and inform tactics. Micro-choices (arrow impressions, then the kernel-smeared handprint) reveal a values hierarchy with cost (spending the last gift). Interiority stays concrete and embodied through sensory action rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s grief and guilt drive specific, embodied choices—from tracing foam to crafting resonant chrysalides—and the renunciatory ending (walking away, pockets empty) reads as earned stasis with cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, with profession‑shaped perception. The internal contradiction (scientific control vs. belated, risky offering to strangers) is present though not combatively dramatized on the page. Minor limitation: few on‑scene pressures directly test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vendor’s motives are clear and particular—she sells “beginnings” by quantifying absence—and her final self-subtraction reads as a credible, costly choice. Interiority is lyric but legible; contradictions surface in her twin roles as vendor and destabilizer. Relationships (boy, librarian) apply momentary pressure that reveals her ethic of trade. A deeper pulse of ambivalence under the final renunciation could raise the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marisol’s motive (to “sandpaper” memories) is clear, embodied through her tactile-cuisine worldview, and credibly evolves into an honoring/transforming stance. The reversal—she gives her own memories to the coral—feels earned by prior sensory pressure (“knees buckled”) and the oceanic grief she encounters. Contradictory impulses (erase vs. honor) are dramatized rather than told. The cost registers as psychic/physical overwhelm and a permanent shift in her gift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mireya’s motive—to restore the tower–elevator dialogue—reads clean and consistent, and her choices (selecting languages, persuading the cuckoo, addressing the elevator) drive the piece. Interiority is conveyed through sensory-musical perception rather than exposition, which feels specific. Internal contradiction is minimal; her competence rarely strains, and the cost is mostly fatigue. Still, the closing endurance—accepting exhaustion to carry the bridge—lands as an earned, quiet change.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s drive is precise and embodied: she risks literal self-erasure to “become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams.” Contradictory impulses—watchmaker care vs. seizure‑twitches, hunger vs. survival—act simultaneously in scene. Micro‑choices (calibrating to the milliradian, initiating the drip at zenith, tearing the helmet free) reveal values and cost. The earned endurance at the end (accepting failure, keeping sketches, resolving to return) forecloses an easy triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear (decades hunting “forgotten combinations”) and choices under pressure are legible (pressing the symbol; choosing the “third option”). Interiority is specific to her prism‑minded perception with embodied cues (iron‑tasting mist, synaptic blaze). The internal conflict is present but subtle—curiosity/rigor versus the cost of self‑translation—so the tension could sharpen earlier. Still, the final renunciation reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilay’s motivation is vivid and consistent—“to create music in a silent world”—and her actions align cleanly with that drive. Embodied interiority (breathing with the wood’s pulse, resin‑scarred hands) feels character‑particular. The piece lacks a strong contradictory impulse or moral friction; her competence faces little internal resistance. Still, the final renunciation of celebration to preserve the spell reads as an earned, character‑true cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific interiority grounds the tutor’s motives; his tactile relationship with the worry stone and pattern‑reading at the nexus reveal character. The final decision to teach “one final student” is credible and seeded by his pedagogical ethos. However, contradictory impulses are muted; he moves from regret to resolve without a sharp in‑scene clash of competing values. Cost is mostly conceptual (exile already paid), not freshly felt at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mirelle’s pacifism concretely governs tactics (refusing to force the lock; choosing resonance), and her interiority is embodied through the radio, safe, and fireworks. The “velvet patches over bullet holes she had never earned” gives a credible contradiction that shades her vow to carry others’ pain. Micro‑choices escalate—waiting, tuning, naming varieties, then singing back—showing a value hierarchy under pressure. The cost is conceptual but legible: she pledges to carry the archive “in her bloodstream.”

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Myrrh’s ambition, craft‑specific perception, and familial custom yield concrete, character‑particular choices (testing the seed, timing the graft, figure‑eight stitching). The internal turn—ambition loosening into gratitude—reads earned by on‑page sensory pressure. Embodied detail (“breathing through her mouth,” “seed sighs”) grounds emotion without labels. The mother’s silent pass adds relational depth without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to learn the source of resilience) drives Aera’s choices, and her tactile, profession-shaped perception grounds interiority. The offering of her memories supplies a credible cost and a felt shift. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or fails, so struggle reads more rhapsodic than contested. The competence tilt slightly softens character pressure in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, competence-forward POV with credible professional tactics and embodied attention to tools. Motivation (foresight, documentation) aligns with actions under pressure, culminating in trusting the patch. Internal contradiction is light—she adapts more than she wrestles—so the emotional cost remains muted. Still, her micro-choices (mapping, transmitting, choosing the gap) reveal a coherent value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, specific motivation (to certify wonder) drives concrete micro‑choices (reading auroral glyphs with skin; angling the wrist; timing the strike). Interiority is embodied through synesthetic perception rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light—duty vs. awe hints at tension but rarely forces a fraught trade‑off. The gift exchange with the sculptor adds grace, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is precise and credible—“to harvest insights from failure”—and her micro‑choices (breathing through the flute, arranging markers, renouncing passage) reveal a specific hierarchy of values. The internal contradiction (drive vs. stillness; fear dressed as certainty) is dramatized rather than lectured. Emotion is largely embodied through sensory attention and ritualized action, though one aphoristic turn (“driven is only half of keeper”) skims close to dictum. The renunciation of the flute arrives earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Quince’s contradictory impulses—widow’s grief vs. astronomer’s logic—act simultaneously and culminate in a costly, motivated choice. Interiority is specific and embodied through the press, the halo fragment, and the tactile work of setting type. The final renunciation (reversing the press) clearly forecloses his habitual borrowing with a felt price. Minor abstraction at times keeps us a hair removed from bodily stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s jittery embodiment, tactile fixation on the pendant, and ache over Corwin’s absence create a credible interior pressure that culminates in the choice to step into legend. Motivation (coaxing wonder from routine) is clear and consistent. The acceptance beat lands as earned, though the conflict remains gentle and occasionally summarized in theme-forward phrasing. Status with the stranger registers, but the scene could push a sharper trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motive—proving objects absorb emotion while grieving his sister—is concrete and drives micro‑choices (the lies, the prism’s placement). Contradictory impulses are dramatized, not told (“I have let you go” versus “I need you still”). Embodied perception (frost, hush, temperature) keeps emotion lived rather than labeled. Slight elevated remove in places is the only distance from a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—the bead’s “cider and copper and goodbye” and lungs “working like bellows with no sound” make the cost visceral. Her decisive choice to crush the amber and surrender her voice is clearly motivated by the recognized bargain. Slight opacity remains around whom the message serves and why she accepts so quickly, muting internal contradiction at the peak. Still, the Earned Stasis lands credibly with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corin’s motive chain is clear and consistent—debt clock, descent, reclamation of a tool, refusal—and his blacksmith knowledge credibly shapes tactics. The “meek” to resolute progression is earned through micro‑choices (folding the mouse, cutting the cable, measured gong strikes). Interiority is mostly shown via embodied action and material attention rather than labels. Slight ding: his inner contradiction is implied more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied interiority and specific micro-choices (kneeling, swallowing the cube, vowing to chart consequences) reveal a singular psyche under pressure. Motivation coheres—she maps absence to weigh withheld truth—and contradicts itself when her own complicity surfaces, sharpening the final renunciation. Emotional texture is concrete (tastes, pulses, balance shifts) rather than labeled. Minor softness: the guilt acceptance is swift, more processed than struggled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s motive—guarding the lighthouse from forgetting—drives every micro‑choice, from adding the flat black stone to bottling the sea glass. His interiority is embodied and specific (the oarlocks matching her steps; the green warmth through the glove). The reticence and ache coexist credibly, and the final endurance reads as an earned stance with cost. The fear she has stepped over the rail sharpens his actions without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s motives and contradictions are legible: she comes “to steer the night, not to birth a sunrise,” yet chooses to press the wick and laugh again, accepting the geas with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile engagement with the wick and lens rather than abstract labels. Micro‑choices (pressing the wick; laughing thrice with escalating consequence) reveal a hierarchy of values. The arc from herald to reader is earned by on‑page action, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motive is clear and particular—new heart, new drive—and his micro‑choices (catching the wing mid‑fall, following sun trails, opening the flask, knotting the thread) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is embodied (terror/tenderness in the borrowed pulse) with credible contradiction. The recognition of why some people “magnetize stories” reads earned by on‑page experience. Slight tilt toward a stated insight keeps this just short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and character‑specific; her competence and gentleness guide concrete micro‑choices (chalk grid, alignment, unscrewing limbs). Internal contradiction is mild—she apologizes to the astronomer yet sacrifices his tool—so pressure on her values is felt but not wrenching. The cost registers as relinquishing the instrument to become a cedar, though she bears little personal risk. Interiority remains embodied through tactile action rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, urgent motivation (rekindle the realm) drives concrete micro‑choices—singing despite fracture, using the mica, and finally self‑wounding to recover memory. Interiority is embodied and particular (“phosphor that stung like remembered joy,” shards in ribs). Internal contradiction—amnesia vs. purpose, solo will vs. need for chorus—registers under pressure. Slight archetypal flatness beyond role keeps this shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradiction—“staying while leaving”—drives concrete micro‑choices, culminating in her surrendering selfhood as cost. Motivation (atoning for the mis‑delivered invitation) is clear and escalates under pressure. Embodied perception (tasting borrowers’ emotions) particularizes interiority beyond labels. Minor distance wideness after transformation trims intimacy but doesn’t undercut the earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mila’s motive—resisting the city’s erasure—drives clear, tangible choices (refusing to eat the loaf; planting it instead). Interiority is specific and embodied (“heuristically gentle,” “tears salting the crust”). The gardener provides a subtle crucible that reframes guilt into action. Slight limitation: Mila’s flaws remain emblematic rather than personally thorny beyond the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive: she honors the vows through measurement until the archive begins to archive her, forcing a conflicted choice. Contradictory impulses are live on the page—duty to measure vs. refusal to let meaning be reduced. Her decisive renunciation (halting the chronometer, fogging the slide, reclassifying it) reads earned and paid with the cost of abandoning her vocational creed. Embodied reactions (pulse falter, breath fog, careful note‑taking) ground the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is precise and layered: she wants proof of corrosion yet longs to be stopped, and both impulses act in scene. Embodied feeling (the fob’s tail digging half‑moons, the horn at her chest) keeps emotion concrete. Jonah’s presence applies quiet pressure without rescuing her. The renunciation—surrendering the heirloom—reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s drive to understand weather-carriers is clear and consistent, and her embodied perceptions (tastes of ozone, old snow) read as character‑specific. The shift from skeptic to mapper of people is earned by the encounter but pays a relatively low on‑page cost. Internal contradiction is muted—she accepts the revelation with little resistance or friction. Secondary characters function symbolically more than as pressure agents, limiting crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (iron/penny taste, cracked nails), and her contradictory impulses—hiding from the festival yet compelled to complete her mother’s work—operate simultaneously. Motivation escalates credibly from avoidance to collaboration, culminating in giving away blank sheets. The mother–daughter legacy drives micro‑choices at each beat. Slight neatness in the aphoristic line about callings reads close to thesis, but it’s earned by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s motive—to recover candor and her mother’s unsent truth—drives every choice, from answering the greenhouse’s questions to using the postal plate. Her interiority is vivid and embodied (“tasted of rust and wilted orchids,” tears strengthening ink). Contradictory impulses surface credibly: fear of echo versus need to risk honesty. Change is earned, though the cost of that change remains more conceptual than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motive—preserving wonder—drives craft‑bound micro‑choices (pin placement, counterweights) to a renunciatory ending (remaining mute, giving the wedge). Interiority is embodied via tactile tuning and “breath‑scriptures,” not labels. Internal contradiction surfaces credibly: heart “cracking open” to speak vs. chosen silence. Slight limitation: relational crucible is minimal until the boy at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    K-17’s contradictory impulses—caretaker protocol versus nostalgia/longing—are dramatized through concrete acts (opening the box, merging, rooting at the nursery). The inner static is embodied via tactile robotics (“servos hummed,” pruning fingers) rather than label-only emotion. The culminating choice to become the farm’s core carries credible cost and follows from established pressure. A few abstract realizations (“understood then”) slightly smooth the messiness of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motives are clear and intensify: a curator who listens, tempted by investigation, ultimately choosing renunciation. Micro-choices (tea to convene witnesses, borescope attempt, staying overnight, refusing to open) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion and POV texture keep her particular (“dust between her ribs,” blanket in desert cold). The only slight softness is a touch of aphoristic closure that risks neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive and method are crystal—decode, dance, retrieve, carry—and her micro‑choices (rolling the dice, choosing the shaft, swallowing the page, triggering the buoy) align under pressure. The interiority is embodied through kinetic thinking (“ankles wrote cursive warnings”) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (trusting chance vs. asserting agency), which keeps the arc elegant but slightly limits friction. The final renunciation—ingesting the seed—reads as an earned, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mael’s motivation—to recover erased memories—is concrete and embodied, driving specific micro‑choices (reading grounds, sacrificing the matchbook, stepping into the projection). The interiority is textured through tactile perception rather than labels, and her conflicting impulses (yearning to hold the mother versus the image’s untouchability) play on the page. The earned shift—heavier with recollection, lighter in body—carries cost and forecloses innocence. Slight limitation: external interpersonal pressure is minimal, keeping the crucible primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear (to hush the prophecy), and his micro‑choices under pressure—unfolding the wing, mapping silence, speaking the “period,” and swallowing the sphere—align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“cold gripping his ankles like forgotten manacles”). Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he’s repelled by the code yet accepts hosting its counterweight at personal cost. A slightly greater torque between fear and duty in the climax could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (companionship refracted through “learning buildings”) and a credible shift to keeper/teacher land with cost as the tutor dissipates. Interiority is specific and embodied through tools and textures (seal, soot, stress fractures). The relationship dynamics with the tutor and the Mrs. Chen coda sharpen the protagonist’s loneliness without sentimentality. Slight softness: acceptance of the role comes smoothly with limited on‑page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradiction—professional skeptic obeying a haunted shell—drives concrete choices and pays off in a costly renunciation (her color vision). Interiority is embodied (the three-note lullaby, fever image), and micro-choices escalate toward humming and paying the price. The earned shift from private reclamation to public release reads as credible and character-specific. Minor hedge: secondary relationships are off-page, so pressure is largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive and contradiction—vengeance forged in her sister’s hand versus the late choice to write in her own—are clear and embodied through the thorn, blood, and key. The shift feels earned via specific micro‑choices (pricking her palm; leaving the thorn). A few epiphanic lines (“we are all incomplete stories”) verge on neatness. Still, the emotional cost of renunciation reads credibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motive—learn why some echo and avoid becoming trapped—drives concrete choices (descending, singing, pressing the shell, finishing the cadence). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, with her gift reading as both edge and burden. The mother cocoon beat forces a charged, value‑revealing decision. A slight neatness in the “lesson learned” coda trims ambiguity but not motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marrow’s motive—to salvage something pure—feels specific and coherent, and her choices (lighting cold candles, bargaining with the glacier, lifting the globe, leaving the mirror) track. Interiority is present through tactile attention (skin sticking to ice) and vocation-shaped noticing. The piece could press harder on contradiction or cost in the moment (she succeeds with little friction), which limits the felt struggle. Still, the final acceptance of cost—letting the mirror go—reads as an earned, quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and embodied choices; the net‑mender’s humility and boldness cohere into the final risk. Micro‑choices (barefoot steps, continued whisking when the moon dims) show values under pressure. The leap onto the shadow staircase reads as an earned synthesis of tradecraft and belief. Slight idealization flattens contradiction, but motivation remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol’s motive—once a debunker now compelled to exhume truth—drives every beat and sharpens at the diamond’s playback. Contradictory impulses are on the page (“almost dropped it, yearning for amnesia” vs. choosing to hang it). Micro‑choices—gloves, pattern‑reading, humming the sign‑off—reveal a precise hierarchy of values under pressure. The closing endurance carries felt cost without moral safety nets.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is specific and consistent—preserving messy human memory against the prophet’s erasures—and her agency (unfolding the array, catching “shadows,” choosing to sing) drives turns. Interiority is vivid and particular, with concrete ties to tools and weather. The recognition that the prophet is also imprisoned complicates her stance credibly. The final renunciation—teaching the light to hold its own shadows—reads earned, though the personal cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Posy’s motivation is vivid and consistent, and her choice to open the rusted lid under the child’s request crystallizes her role and risk. Interiority is concrete (“bones humming,” the cat‑brush feeling of redemption) and choices align with her values. Internal tension—faith that the jars can “forgive history” vs. doubt about lacking the great‑grandmother’s song—registers without therapy‑speak. The small relationship beat with the child reframes her solitude into purpose with a credible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mireya’s motives and contradictions are vivid: duty to the Echo versus the town’s safety culminates in the “third path” choice. Interiority is embodied through sound-as-thinking and the “logically emotional calculus.” Micro‑choices (tempo shifts, bowing changes, driving the key into the pier) reveal values under pressure. The cost registers in the worn key and her tears, an earned endurance rather than neat triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s impatience/patience duality is embodied (“a second heart rattling its cage”) and resolved through earned endurance and precise action. His micro‑choices—mapping, waiting, pressing the compass, leaving it as offering—align with motive and cost. The closing internal shift (“impatience finally cool into…a smooth, dark stone”) feels paid for by the scene, not declared. Limited relational pressure is the only minor gap.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied (lantern heat, counting steps), with credible contradictory impulses: intrusive flashback vs. professional steadiness. Her investigative micro‑choices under pressure (decoding tallies, extracting the box, deciding to include the unsanitized truth) align with motives. A few direct statements (“This was why she had taken the case”) edge toward telling, but they don’t undercut the earned shift. The final choice feels like an earned endurance/renunciation with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Emil’s motives (contrition into action before dawn) are clear and pressure-tested through specific choices: producing Rowan’s list, directing Olya, and sacrificing the candle fund. Interiority is embodied via tactile attention to the clockwork heart and storm. Olya’s “aptly deliberate” stance counters him with measured pragmatism. The earned endurance at the end—walking toward the execution with a new course set—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Juniper’s motive—to find and ring the unheard bell—drives concrete choices (descending into acid spray, improvising the strike), with a credible blend of irreverence and awe. Internal contradiction is present but light (smirking awe rather than a deeper conflict), yet her agency is consistent and character‑particular. The dulled arrow and bubbling paint register modest costs tied to her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, compelling motivation (paid to remember what others must forget) intensifies credibly into defiance at the firewall bargain. Interiority is specific and embodied through objects (patch, crystal) rather than labels. The mother reveal braids personal stakes with professional duty and earns the self-erasure choice. A touch more on her fear or hesitation at the bargain could deepen contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—mapping empathy onto action—drives every choice, and the rescue visibly costs him (smashed mirror, branded palms). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (listening to silence like foghorns, shadow‑laced coat). Relationship pressure with Sira sharpens decisions and alters their state by the end. Slightly low tension in contradictory impulses—he’s almost too calibrated—keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives are distinct and embodied: she rejects “spectacle” for grief-as-teacher, refuses to record final words, and ultimately gives away the heirloom. Her internal contradiction (witness vs. act; hold vs. hinge) drives micro‑choices under pressure. The boy adds relational pressure without stealing focus. The only soft spot is that some later-life consequence is summarized rather than felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marcus reads as specific and consistent—seasoned, stubborn, tender toward land—with tangible history and a credible present want. His interiority is clear and mostly embodied via wine, soil, and the letter, though insights sometimes arrive a touch too tidy. The micro‑choice to graft tomorrow and to reinterpret the letter as “inheritance” lands as an earned endurance rather than a dramatic pivot. Lack of live relational pressure on the page limits contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation (preserve the echo) with a credible wound (the scar/past failure) and disciplined method. Interiority is particular (“peripheral awareness,” refusal of desperation) but the micro‑choices are ritualized rather than pressure‑driven. The emotional cost is implied more than felt beyond the unmasking moment. A touch more contradiction under stress would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—she comes weekly to transmute communal pain—but internal contradiction remains subtle (calm vs. grief) rather than pressure-tested. Micro-choices (breathing for the bee, aligning arcs, waiting for witnesses) reveal values, though visible cost is light. The calm, meticulous ethic feels embodied and consistent. The closure is earned, but the character pays little on-page price beyond time and attention.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s restraint, cataloger’s mindset, and shift from control to witnessing are clear and consistent. Her micro-choices—listening, testifying, placing the crystal, leaving without looking back—reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction (fact‑bound certainty vs. openness to the library’s living memory) is credible but softly contested. The cost is quiet—renunciation of mastery rather than a dramatic sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular drive (to find/hear aging) enacted through tactile choices—chalk, driftwood, cassette. The precognitive amnesia complicates tactics and values, producing an honest contradiction: clinging to echoes as a form of letting go. Embodied emotion runs through scents, textures, and creaks rather than labels. The endurance choice at the end (marking what will fade) reads as an earned stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motives (repair vs. release) are clear and consistent, and her choices under pressure—using the clock hand as film, timing by the leaf-sound, leaving—reveal a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is particular and embodied (“luminous ache,” tactile tools, the Hasselblad with lunar dust). The mantra-like line “to harness the ephemeral…” edges toward stated theme but reads as her credo rather than authorial intrusion. The final choice forecloses her life at the observatory with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—to deliver a “flawless goodbye”—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile, sensory choices under pressure. Her “decisively kind” stance directs concrete actions (placing the shard, modulating the music, guiding the daughter). Interiority is specific (vinyl scent as hope), though her inner conflict is subdued—competence outweighs contradiction. Still, the final redefinition of “reunify” registers as earned growth with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s motive—to relearn what was unlearned and retrieve shadows—is clear and drives concrete, escalating choices (keying the automaton, closing loops, surrendering the key to her shadow). The “quietly deliberate” trait manifests in her methodical operations rather than in label-only description. Internal cost is present but understated: trading her wandering silhouette and assuming guardianship reads as an Earned Stasis. A touch more friction or contradictory impulse on the page could deepen her interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interior conflict—skepticism shattered yet yearning for a restored “click of rightness”—is embodied and specific, and her micro‑choices (following the new path, accepting the map, setting the tooth) align with motive under pressure. The horror is morally complex (“the fraud had been tender”), avoiding neat absolution. The final stance (living with bright fractures) carries a felt cost without safety‑hedging. Minor aphoristic moments from the changeling don’t undercut her credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular: to “share light without burning,” sharpened by villagers’ fear and her rooftop solitude. Interiority is embodied (“weight settle inside her chest”) and micro‑choices (polishing ritual, using tongs, the weighing) reveal values. A subtle contradiction—reverence for the pearl vs. willingness to let it dissolve—lands as earned. Slight limitation: no opposing character on the page to pressure her in dialogue or status terms.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motives are clear and particular: after a viral confession, she seeks a slower, self‑governed healing (“graft new meaning”). Contradictory impulses—visibility vs. privacy—surface in the choice to record and then bury the file. Interiority is embodied through tactile, character‑specific noticing (spores on skin, pendant’s warmth). Elias applies gentle but real pressure by offering the tablet—the “next sentence the world had not yet earned.”

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive is clear (salvage the book/career) and complicated by a deeper flaw (hoarding vs releasing hope). Embodied, character‑specific interiority (“mist tasted of salt and wet paper”) grounds her choices. The key turn—offering the shell back to be “rewritten”—is earned by the escalating cameos and her shame with Lira. Minor abstraction in a few lyrical lines doesn’t blunt pressure or credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation (daughter’s “forgetting sickness” and cultural restoration) is clear and drives concrete choices (song sequences, precise pollen release). Interiority is embodied through tactile actions and sensory attention, though inner contradiction is minimal and she rarely falters. Competence dominates; we don’t see genuine risk of failure beyond timing stress. Still, her micro‑choices under the live clock feel earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The alchemist’s motive—harvest starlight to finish a living-heart map—is specific, embodied, and consistent, with patience and renunciation in tension. Her war-map past reframes her vow and current method, adding moral pressure without speechifying. Micro-choices under cold (waiting, arranging refuse, folding the paper) reveal character. The final turn toward relinquishment is strong but truncated, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation (restore stolen hours; “store wonder in the cellar of reason”) drives concrete choices. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft and sensory bias (peripheral focus, calipers of shadow). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt—curiosity vs. restraint—yet it culminates credibly in the renunciatory lock. Minor softness: pressure rarely forces visibly painful trade‑offs until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motives are clean and embodied: she gathers others’ burdens to stabilize the valley yet resists naming her own until the lamp sputter forces a choice. The confession and the blood-on-wick price reveal contradiction and cost without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (orienting breath, tilting flame, touching sheets) track a credible progression toward the vulnerable act. Relationship pressure is deftly externalized via the sister memory and the grotto’s listening.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives are vivid and consistent—contain memory, harvest lessons, resist and accept—expressed through embodied actions (carving, whispering commands, hanging the latch). Contradictory impulses (cage vs. key; keep closed vs. open) are dramatized rather than declared. Micro‑choices under pressure accrue credibly to an Earned Stasis. Slight loss: the internal struggle never faces an external counterforce in scene, limiting crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear motive (settle a debt with the ghost-self) and layered internal conflict (hesitating over 2015) drive concrete trades with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied (“silence that rings in broken teeth”). The renunciation and identity inversion at the end are earned by prior choices. Minor note: the “scavenger” label could bear one more embodied decision to stress resolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s motive—engineering “equations for hope”—is clear and drives tactile choices (rerouting pumps, hacking a beacon). Interiority is character‑specific, filtered through an engineer’s lens. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a personal price beyond leaving without applause. Still, her micro‑choices reveal values with credible restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear: pride, regret, and a tender, disciplined attention culminate in a credible renunciation. Micro‑choices—placing the bear, saying “I release you,” planting the seed—align with a consistent interior logic. Embodied feeling (tiles murmuring, bear darkening) grounds the internal conflict. Slight idealization (minimal mess or doubt at the peak) keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s drive is precise and sustained, with embodied interiority (“calm outside, quake within”) that avoids therapy-speak. Her micro-choices—boarding, decoding logs, asking Riga to beach, salvaging—align tightly with motive. Contradiction (daughter of a “hero” seeking to dismantle his myth) gives her arc moral texture. Riga’s presence adds clean status pressure without crowding the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ari’s motive—to preserve living knowledge—drives every micro‑choice, from warming the crown‑in‑reverse to cracking the bead despite its archival value. Interiority is filtered through tactile action rather than label‑speak, giving us a credible, embodied practitioner. The harbormaster adds status pressure that she negotiates with patience rather than bravado. A touch more contradictory impulse on the page would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: she seeks the “geography of healing” and chooses to kneel, wind, name, and finally plant the thread. Interiority is vivid though largely assured; there’s little on‑page hesitation or contradictory impulse before surrendering the thread. The cost—ending her vocation—is felt but the struggle toward it is smooth, not contested. Still, actions align with motives and the final renunciation reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Desire and method are vividly embodied: he wants to “reawaken beauty” and acts via specific, odd micro‑choices (distilling moonlight, pin‑mapping his sobbing). Contradictory impulses surface (grave‑robbing with apology; tenderness inside machinery), lending moral texture. His final smile as the palace falls reads as an earned renunciation/acceptance with visible cost. Slightly limited by absence of an on‑page relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied: ritual planting as reconciliation with an arsonist father. Contradictory impulses act in scene—flinch at the gull/courtroom echo vs. steady hands, anger vs. compassion. Micro-choices (coin on the smallest pine; logging GPS as “Station Green 13”) expose values with felt cost. A few thesis-like lines border on explicitness but remain earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and self-incriminating (the admission she, too, left a child) and her choices (following light, speaking to the box, opening it) align with a skeptical-but-driven temperament. Motivation is clear—liberation rather than grief—and intensifies as each fountain raises personal stakes. The transformation from skeptic to daughter reads earned, with the cost of relinquishing defenses and the box. Minor safety: the emotional labor proceeds smoothly, with limited friction beyond recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—share light without fire—drives clear, character‑specific choices (following the sharp echo, pressing the gear to the beacon). Interiority is textured and embodied (“hearts ache,” the prophecy tightening around his ribs). The generational fracture furnishes real internal conflict between rooted endurance and transmission. His renunciation (leaving the gear, choosing wave over root) feels earned and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular—she answers a spectral summons to “retrace” communal sorrow—and her choices (mapping with ribbon, refusing to carve a name, tying the dyed ribbon for the monarchs) align with a coherent value system. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft instincts rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is modest (competence outweighs struggle), but the late image of her own name in forget‑me‑nots adds a quiet, personal cost. The character reads distinct and consistent across the accumulative turns.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Motivation is crystalline and pressure-tested: the winder must choose between stopping, continuing, or altering the clock, with embodied cost (“arms burning,” lashing the rake handle). Contradictory impulses—duty to mechanism vs. loyalty to brother vs. the village’s fear—coexist on the page. Micro‑choices (halting at the pause, carving the “r,” swapping the bob, overwinding) reveal a hierarchy of values. The resulting endurance feels earned and morally complex rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mercy’s curiosity and tenderness motivate each step cleanly, and her occupational habits (“tenderly organized”) pay off as capability. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets each threshold with near-frictionless competence. The identity shift into “keeper of the spiral” lands, but the emotional price is implied more than contested. A single on‑page hesitation or competing duty would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is lucid and particular—“to seed innovation within a constraint”—and her micro‑choices (climbing, listening, writing at the cost of memories) align under pressure. Interiority is textured and embodied (frostbite, ache, hunger of the quill) rather than labeled. The renunciation of name and warmth earns the final endurance/identity shift. Slight abstraction at times softens felt contradiction, but the sacrifice remains credible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mila’s goal and tactics are crystal clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (rosin ink, antennae, not fleeing) align with a disciplined temperament. Interiority is textured through sensory focus rather than abstract labels. The risk to her is legible but her contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers. The endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis with quiet cost rather than a wrenching trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motives (to stage grief as art) are embodied through concrete micro‑choices: carrying/placing the chair, calibrating sight lines, donning the shard‑mask, and scattering powder. Contradictory impulses—comfort vs. absence, truth vs. self‑story—operate on the page. The cost registers in her acceptance of a story that can’t be completed, with the mask pressing where her grandmother’s hands once were. A touch of declarative summation trims peak ambiguity but doesn’t flatten her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Caldera’s motives are coherent and particular: a rational contrarian who stakes her health and ethics on sewage micro‑dosing and archival salvage. Contradictory impulses—rebellion versus method, denial‑peeling versus complicit silence—play out in embodied choices (the femur stylus; the hidden lead sheet; breaking her silence). The final public utterance feels earned and costly as the crowd recoils. A touch more friction with a specific person on the surface could intensify relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motive is clear and character-particular: restore communal harmony by subtracting her own noise. Interiority is embodied (the rosette drinking lamplight; “frequencies anger forgets”), and her rage is acknowledged then worked through via action. The decisive sacrifice—offering her voice—reads earned by prior steps. Slight softness: the process feels relatively unresisted, with minimal friction beyond the internal, trimming peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s motives are clear and embodied—steal, plant, prune, and accept risk to alter collective memory. Sensory interiority is distinct (tasting glass, blood-fed sprout), though internal contradiction is light; she rarely doubts or wavers. Micro‑choices (timed planting, blood offering, pruning lullabies) reveal values without therapy‑speak. The cost is present but mostly conceptual; she evades direct confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—preserving wonder against the erosion of routine—is concrete and drives every choice, culminating in the costed lie. The involuntary-truth constraint produces credible internal contradiction at the peak. Her micro-choices (recalibrating the turnstile, locking the booth, taking the stairs, pressing palms to copper) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The boy functions as a catalyst without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, consistent motive—a “creeping normality noticer” who seeks grammar over eviction—drives specific micro‑choices (shoe turned, frame skewed, paper boat). Interiority is filtered through sensory ritual rather than labels, giving character‑particular texture. The main limitation is minimal internal contradiction; she seldom hesitates or pays a visible emotional price beyond restraint. Still, her renunciation of possession and covenant gesture read as an earned, character‑true endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and particular: a newly conscious statue negotiates duty, complicity, and curiosity with concrete micro-choices (gliding, testing awakenings, pausing at the arch). The moral conflict—preserving “museum of certainties” versus risking exposure—feels earned and charged by the gardener’s braided presence. The admission of the court’s hypocrisy gives the decision cost. Slight remove from embodied stakes (no other on‑page character pushing back) keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—an ex‑mathematician trying to model and then feel the “texture” of regret. Contradictory impulses (panic when motion falters vs. the lure of a possible exit) collide in scene at the ripple. Micro‑choices reveal values: bleeding a sigma to restart motion, refusing to step through, sacrificing the perfect die. The cost is legible and earned by prior traits and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motive—to coax a lost language and finish an uncommissioned mural—drives concrete choices (mirror, indigo brew, brushwork) and culminates in a credible shift from blade-like fatigue to blanket-like rest. Interiority is embodied through sensory obsessions rather than label-speak, and her realization that the mural is “for lungs” reads as earned, not declared. The relationship with Jules is quiet but meaningful, adding communal pressure without stealing focus. Internal contradiction is subtle (compulsion vs. care for others), not strongly dramatized, which trims the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aurelia’s motive—rescuing dying arts—drives concrete choices (bread initials, refitting the lens, confronting the Council). Interiority is textured through sensory bias (“rosewater dread,” bread ritual) and embodied acts. The relationship with Milo is functional and revealing (status and craft solidarity). Internal contradiction is present but light; her shift from curator to orchestrator lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear from the first line—escape a fated death—and every choice (handling the yoyo, tying on the stone, cutting the string) aligns under rising pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, with “bleak exhilaration” countering dread to show contradictory impulses. The decisive renunciation (trading his counterclockwise gift for possibility) lands with visible cost. Minor note: emotional texture is lyrical rather than granular in places, but it remains embodied via object work.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clean and urgent: confront fear to extract its weakness, immediately after resuscitation. Interiority is vivid and embodied (heat of the clasp, sawdust‑clogged throat), with credible contradiction (cannot “unbosom,” chooses an alternative tactic). Actions are consistent and revealing across pressure points (pinning the photo; handing the clasp to the child). The renunciation at the end (advisor gone; clasp left) reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prophet’s motive and modus operandi are clear and consistent, and his choices drive every turn. Interiority is mostly inferred through sensory focus and craft rather than explicit conflicting impulses, so cost reads conceptual more than emotional. His competence under pressure is compelling but nearly frictionless. The strongest beat for character revelation is when he strikes absence and recruits the crew—leadership over comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive and embodied interiority (“sunwashed and bright, yet dread pooled beneath them”) drive credible micro‑choices, especially the altered note. The ritualized persistence reads as “quietly driven” without label‑speak. The emotional cost lands when her desire for answers collides with the city’s danger and the truth about the gate. Internal contradiction (duty vs longing) is present but could sharpen with one more pressured micro‑trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive—to expose the monarchy’s deception—anchors every action, and her internal pull between the codex’s seductive beauty and her allegiance to truth is credibly dramatized (“its gold still arrogant... she almost understood”). Micro‑choices under pressure (tile prying, semaphore climb, evasion over confrontation) reveal priorities. “Emotionally rational” is repeated a touch declaratively, but the heartbeat metronome and tactile search keep emotion embodied. The renunciation of inherited myth (“shedding of inherited false glory”) feels earned with a visible/imagined social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motive is vivid and particular—shifting from certifying what stands to preserving absences—and every micro‑choice (ink offering, smuggling confessions into cracks) aligns. “Stoically sensitive” is embodied (the gull’s cry; the chill marble) rather than labeled. The ethical cost of altering surveyed repairs is implied but not confronted on the page by counter‑pressure. A sharper on‑scene consequence or relational crucible would nudge this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive (trace the catalogue’s origins) is concrete and persists under pressure, with embodied beats like stamping her wrist and working by touch. Her contradictory impulses—devotion to order vs. suspicion that the catalogue is indexing her—surface credibly and guide choices. The final renunciation (to rewrite remembering the land) feels earned, though the personal cost against the Council is mostly implied rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Her motive—to transmute her daughter’s last dream into cranes—drives every choice, with concrete micro-actions (choosing the southern stair, pocketing a leaf, breathing in the dream) revealing craft and grief in tension. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft details and sensory memory rather than labels. The Earned Stasis at the end (smoke leaving; hands smelling only of tea) reads as a costly renunciation, not a neat cure. Slightly limited contradiction on the page, but the push-pull between holding and letting go is present in the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Grief, guilt, and ruthless pragmatism coexist on the page, culminating in a self-sacrificial choice that’s earned by prior actions. The “death’s accountant” realization cuts through any safety-hedging and reframes his agency. Embodied beats (crystal against ribs, taste of cake) anchor interior stakes. Minor abstraction creeps in occasionally but doesn’t blunt motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive (find the “frequency of belonging” tied to her missing parents) is clear and her choices—approaching, engaging, pulling the lever—align. Interiority is particular (recognizing her grandmother’s charts; bodily response to the frequencies). However, internal contradiction is mild; she meets little resistance and the pilgrim applies minimal pressure. The final renunciation (leaving old uncertainty) lands but at a relatively low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt-driven agency is vivid and particular: she carves false histories into driftwood with a dead man’s watch hand and ultimately confesses her brother’s name. Contradictory impulses (self-exoneration through fabrication vs. the need to face truth) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—casting the “rosary” into the sea—lands with felt cost. Minor note: a relationship crucible is absent by design, keeping the conflict purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motives (recycling mistakes into wisdom, protecting neutrality) are clear and embodied through concrete choices: offering gloves, timing the exchange to the moon, halting the herald, initiating the knot‑casting ritual. Interiority arrives via tactile anchors (the drawer pull) rather than abstract labels, and his regret informs each micro‑decision. The visible cost—relinquishing the talisman and refusing signatures—feels earned. Slight softness: external resistance is minimal, letting his competence glide through without much friction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are precise and embodied: safety-by-chart versus truth-by-pulse drives every micro‑choice. Key turns—following the irregular pole light despite shoals, accepting the compass’s failure—are credibly earned. The injury from the compass and her laugh “halfway between a sob and a toast” ground emotion beyond abstraction. The final acceptance forecloses an old path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and active: he wants to rebuild empathy and chooses risk (stealing the coat, entering the lake) under pressure. Contradictory impulses register in the “diagonals” choice and the bargain moment—he weighs remaining hollow against fracturing. Embodied sensations (“cold fire,” borrowed rhythms, nausea) ground the shift. The ending shows a credible endurance arc (letters, responsibility) with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline—“I only asked for her”—and every step tightens toward the sacrificial merge. Contradictory impulses are present (resisting her own metamorphosis while courting it to reach the sister). Embodiment is specific (branded lip, stinging oils, hollowing bones) and choices flow from felt pressure. The final renunciation (die into the other’s form) lands with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and specific: a grieving mother seeking the pooled minutes after a stillbirth. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“silver moss,” “tasted of iron and lullabies”) with contradictory impulses—reverence and pain—held together. Her key choices (spreading cards, tracing the name, inviting the night to tea) align with motive and culminate in a credible reconfiguration. Minor sentiment brushes the edges near the end but does not undercut the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Halcyon’s motive is crystalline and embodied—collecting photos, stitching a sail, and choosing to stay—but her internal conflict is minimal, with little wobble under pressure beyond the hologram mothers’ warnings. The pacifist stance coheres through micro‑choices (hair‑thread knots as vows). The final renunciation (staying) reads as an earned stasis with implied cost (solitude, no return). Slight lack of struggle at the corridor (“She did not flinch”) keeps it short of elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kira’s motive—to grasp the texture of transformation—drives concrete choices, especially the costly release of the vials. Contradictory impulses register: clinging to preserved memories vs. surrendering them to serve a larger pattern. Embodied detail (heat, steam, bone‑deep vibration) grounds her interiority. A few thesis-like lines tilt toward telling, softening raw ambiguity in her final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Garnet’s motive—obedience tipping into invention—is clear, embodied, and drives every micro‑choice from picking the lock to deceiving Voss. The internal contradiction (sentinel vs. saboteur) is present and dramatized rather than told. Luce and Voss apply targeted pressure that sharpens her choices. Minor note: her competence faces few setbacks, so struggle reads slightly cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s drive to “understand the sacred patterns” versus his learned surrender creates a credible internal contradiction. His micro-choices—placing rocks by golden ratio, accepting the curse’s vision without why—reveal character under pressure. The death‑bound promise to Mira focuses his motives and makes the final renunciation costly. Slight remove from embodied struggle (he rarely errs or doubts) keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, embodied interiority and a credible drive: she uses craft choices (scalpel, enlarger, fixer) to reclaim censored memory. Contradictory impulses—tenderness toward the censor-lover and ruthless self‑exposure—coexist under pressure. Micro‑choices escalate (sending the plane; speaking the forbidden stanza; writing with fixer). The arc lands as acceptance-through-development rather than erasure, with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vela’s motives and contradictions (combativeness turned invitational) are clear and embodied through the arm, card, and footwork; Caelus’s scar and vocoder add credible cost. Their status dynamic shifts on the page from duel to partnership. Emotional specificity comes via tactile choices (tracing shadows, lowering the card), though interiority remains more stylized than deeply felt. Still, the final hand‑clasp reads earned by prior micro‑choices.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lark’s contradictory impulses (shedding the “cynical, drunken” skin yet fearing thinness of the new one) drive credible choices, culminating in a steadier, risk‑taking bluff before Rourke. Marin is distinctly sketched—competent authority tempered by quiet rebellion—and her choices pressure and redirect Lark. Embodied emotion (heat, ash, trembling skin) keeps motivations concrete. The only softness: Rourke’s quick capitulation trims the felt cost on their character changes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, character‑driven motives (waiting vs. stepping into life) power each choice, with embodied images (clock strapped with a silk scarf, the traded chime) revealing her contradictions. The internal conflict is active on the page: refuge in the loop versus cost of leaving safety. A credible renunciation lands when she ends the unresolved chord and exits. Slight distance from granular, lived bodily stress keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Calyx’s motivation is clear and compelling, and the internal contradiction (duty to truth vs. loyalty to memory/self) is dramatized in the seed bargain. Her emotions are embodied through sensory specifics (coppery ink, storm-cooled air, or the ridge’s “heartbeat”). The final renunciation (losing the teacher’s name) is a credible, felt cost that forecloses a path. Secondary characters apply light but relevant pressure without muddying her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is precise and embodied—his slow, deliberate choices (burying the compass for the bonsai, dyeing the lace with breath) reveal a specific moral calculus. Contradictory impulses (hesitation vs. action) surface as he carries regret yet initiates return. The cost is felt: he leaves talismans behind and faces the academy with a “banner of surrender.” Minor softness: emotional conflict is largely internal, with little live pushback beyond the mist‑students.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling and consistent internal contradiction. Her professional motivation to "strip needless drama" and resist anthropomorphizing is beautifully tested by the "kindled humility" she feels when confronted with the biological complexity of a butterfly scale. This internal conflict is not merely stated but embodied in her actions and perceptions, making her intellectual journey feel earned and resonant. The fusion of her identity as an astrophysicist with her actions as a field biologist is seamless and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves organically from a physical quest to an internal one. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, profession-specific details (frost as glazing, breath on glass) that make her perspective unique. The final change is earned by the pivotal moment of reflection at the campfire, avoiding any sense of an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are consistent with her scientific background. The emotional arc from survivor's grief to creator's wonder is earned. The characterization is very strong, though the internal conflict within the scene itself is more of a process of discovery than a struggle between contradictory impulses, which slightly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    The undertaker's transformation from a reluctant, stubborn man into a willing, eternal caretaker is both profound and earned within the story's mythic logic. His motivation, rooted in an "unpaid debt to the departed," is clear and compelling. The final, quiet acceptance, where he sees his own name in the book, is a masterclass in character closure, showing a man who finally understands his place is not among the living but in service to the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal shift from viewing the donations as mercy to seeing them as an "investment" provides a powerful, earned turning point that reorients the entire community’s struggle from survival to legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority rendered through concrete, poetic embodiment (the "hairline fracture" and the "ache of affection folded and refolded until it cut"). The protagonist's final transformation from a seeker to a distributor of love is earned through the central ritual, representing a profound and credible change. The man serves effectively as a mirror for her own pain, making their connection immediate and believable within the story's magical realist framework.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and embodied through her specific fear of the fading photographs. The internal conflict between preservation and acceptance drives the narrative to a decisive, earned choice. Her transformation from a designer of external structures to a medium for an internal one is a profound character change, satisfying the crucible test. The line "her eyes already searching for exits" is a brilliant, economical link between her childhood self and her present dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is staggering in its clarity and is embodied in every action. Her defining trait—"patient strategic"—is not merely stated but demonstrated through her non-lethal handling of the guards and her eleven-year wait. The character is revealed through her interaction with objects, from the mocking bracelet of the empty cuff to the cellophane arrow, creating a portrait of resilience that is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is rendered with exceptional concreteness despite the abstract nature of her goal, particularly in her sensory perception ("heard the forge as a slow cello"). The final change, from seeking external blame to acknowledging her own complicity, is a profound and earned reversal, with the cost of that knowledge felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The thief's internal conflict—between the transactional nature of her work and a deeper curiosity—is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice that is both surprising and earned. The discovery of the ring's inscription provides a powerful, concrete catalyst for her shift in motivation. A minor weakness is the final sentence's slight over-articulation of her new mission, which verges on summarizing the change rather than letting it rest in the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mara's interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail, and her defining trait—the "contemplative glassblower"—is dramatized through action, not just stated. The coping mechanism of narrating tasks is an ingenious device that reveals her internal state, provides a unique voice, and feels entirely authentic to a creative person wrestling with grief. The final change is earned by the preceding accumulation of small choices and sensory inputs, passing the 9+ test with a clearly costed final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's central contradiction—a phobia-ridden stuntman—is expertly dramatized through embodied actions like his trembling flashlight and counting down heartbeats. The motivation is clear and visceral, and the final change feels earned by the preceding events. The characterization is only slightly weakened by the final paragraph's overly articulate self-analysis ("proof that being who I thought I wasn’t is exactly who I need to be"), which feels more like a thematic summary than an in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The oracle’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained, evolving from “mild obsession” to a tender, hungry stewardship. Her single-minded focus is made concrete through her decisive, non-verbal dismissal of the guard. While her internal landscape is entirely in service to the conceptual plot, her actions, particularly the final choice to use her own shadow as ink, feel both inevitable and earned, providing a strong anchor for the mythic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The robot's motivation to understand thought is exceptionally clear and well-escalated from curiosity to obsession. The internal conflict between its programmed function and its emergent consciousness is dramatized effectively, culminating in the choice to play the violin. The final state of "remarkably composed despite the revolution" is an earned and powerful character moment, representing a change that forecloses the old path of seeking escape for a new one of embracing the process.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mira's characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear internal conflict between her scrupulous nature and a desire for reconciliation. The moment her impulse for confrontation is "cooled" by a new understanding is a masterful depiction of an internal turn. Her motivation to "thaw mistrust" is tested and transformed, leading to a final act of grace that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is deeply rooted in her decades-long relationship with the garden, and her interiority is rendered through concrete objects—the marbles—that carry specific, resonant histories. The final shift in understanding from "master" to "partner" is an earned epiphany, not a sudden declaration, fulfilling the arc with a felt cost: the surrender of a long-held, albeit false, sense of control.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a potent internal conflict between regret and acceptance. The motivation to "prove that time moves sideways" is a compelling externalization of an internal need to revisit a past bargain. The character's final Earned Stasis is credible because it's re-priced on the page, transforming her relationship with the "mechanically warm" lungs from a burden into a complex form of companionship.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The musician's motivation is clearly established and consistent, rooted in a feeling of liminality that makes him uniquely receptive to the ghost. His internal conflict is more a dawning awareness than a struggle between contradictory impulses. The final choice feels earned, though the connection between him and the ghost is almost too perfectly symmetrical, slightly reducing the sense of a difficult, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. The oracle’s motivation is singular and visceral, driving every action from the initial sensory details to the final logbook entry. The internal conflict between containing the truth and the need to expel it is dramatized through specific, costly micro-choices, such as the initial touch of the illustration versus the final, deliberate erasure. The final renunciation is earned, with the cost made explicit in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is established immediately and his defining traits—recklessness and skepticism—provide the perfect internal conflict for the supernatural events. The arc from seeking "numbers, not prayer" to becoming the carrier of a metaphysical burden is clear, earned, and lands with a palpable cost. The character’s transformation is the story's anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation is clear and deeply felt, rooted in the oath to "witness change without judgment." Her interiority is beautifully rendered, particularly the central conflict between her duty and the yearning for oblivion. The final realization that her "loose grip on reality was not decay but mercy" is a powerful character turn, earned by the oppressive weight of her task shown throughout the story.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established immediately and with poetic precision—to combat the fading of "ordinary magic." Her interiority is beautifully embodied through her connection to the objects in her satchel, particularly the baby curl. The critical micro-choice, pressing the curl to her wrist when her power wavers, is a powerful, earned moment that externalizes her internal struggle and resolve, perfectly aligning action with motive.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The historian's motivation is established immediately and remains the unwavering engine of the narrative. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through embodied, sensory details—feeling the floor tilt, the tapestry warming against her ribs—which prevents her from being a mere cipher. The final transformation into the "displaced axis" is a significant change, earned by the accumulative logic of the story, though the line "knowing she had become the displaced axis she sought" is a fraction too explicit for an otherwise masterfully subtextual piece.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Chen’s motivation is crystalline and compelling: the desire to escape a defined past for an unknown future. His interiority is rich, blending the practical calculus of a spy with the soul of a poet, and this contradiction is dramatized effectively through his actions. The final choice to leave is earned by the preceding beats, particularly the self-realization prompted by his own fortune. The keeper serves as a simple but effective anchor to the world Chen is leaving behind.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The priest’s motivation is clear, and his internal conflict is powerfully embodied in the final recorded swallow—a specific, costly action. The shift from tasting iron to blood provides a visceral sense of the price paid for clarity. The woman acts as a perfect foil, her quiet, decisive actions—tilting the palette, painting the cross—propelling the narrative without needing extensive interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation—resolving the ache of being "chronologically homesick"—is clear, particular, and powerfully embodied. Her internal conflict between physical exhaustion and the urgent need to complete her symphony is dramatized with visceral detail ("lungs tasted iron"). The final change, the dissolution of her ache, feels earned through the crucible of the ritual she performs, making the character arc both satisfying and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, potent, and dramatized effectively through his interactions with the fractured reality. The backstory of the father and the broken clocks is perfectly integrated, adding psychological depth without halting momentum. The only slight weakness is the Elder Kael's line defining the minotaur; while effective, it verges on diagnostic self-awareness, though its source makes it forgivable and necessary for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied, rooted in her specific experience as a deaf music teacher. Her grief-driven numbness is not just stated but demonstrated through her quest for a feeling she cannot hear. The final pivot from seeking to reverse time to accepting its forward beat ("reversing nothing, simply living") is an earned and powerful character change, achieved with a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her meticulous nature. The choice to act is earned by the inciting incident, and her internal state is well-embodied ("Ice traced her spine"). The single moment of slight weakness is the on-the-nose declaration "motivation...flared like a lantern in wind," which tells rather than shows, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise strong, internally coherent characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between the grieving man and the analytical “broker” is rendered with precision and embodied feeling, avoiding cliché. Elian’s transformation from a seller of light to a cultivator of scent is an earned, resonant arc. His motivation is clear, potent, and his final change feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, specific, and earned. The interiority is rich with concrete, embodied emotion, perfectly aligning the poet’s sensibility with the thematic focus on texture and weight. The final choice to endure is not a passive acceptance but an active embrace, earned through a compelling internal journey that weighs the particular (Marcus's rope) against the abstract (transcendence).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in her artistic sensibility and family history. Her actions are consistent, and her interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail. The single point of weakness is the on-the-nose epiphany, "Mara understood: beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation," which reads as a diagnostic summary rather than an embodied realization, slightly flattening the moment of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling internal conflict between professional armor and a desperate need for authenticity. The motivation is clear and intensifies perfectly. The final change feels earned, particularly the realization that “insight without empathy was just surveillance,” which avoids diagnostic label-speak by being grounded in a visceral, sensory climax. Her contradictory impulses are dramatized in the hesitation before pressing the petal to her wrist, a micro-choice with immense weight.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marisol’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a well-established internal philosophy that motivates every action. The contradiction between her shrewd professional persona and her private compassion is shown, not told, through the "clerical error." Her final choice to give away the locket is a powerful, earned action with a visible cost that perfectly encapsulates her values.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation to “graft herself onto community” is exceptionally clear and sustained, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The change she undergoes is earned and emotionally resonant. However, her interiority occasionally presents as overly articulate and self-aware for a moment of crisis or discovery (e.g., "to prove she could be mystery enough for someone to miss"), which slightly tempers the raw embodiment of her emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira’s motivation is singular, deeply felt, and propels every action. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through the central metaphor of the "interrupted cadence," which embodies her grief in a way that is both specific and powerful. The final choice to surrender her future is earned by the preceding journey and demonstrates a clear, costly hierarchy of values, fulfilling the 9+ test perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's central conceits. The protagonist's motivation—to resolve the grief of ambiguous loss—is clear and sustained. Interiority is rendered through a unique and consistent lexicon of mathematics and magic, avoiding generic emotional labels; lines like "the silence felt like an equation I had yet to balance" establish a powerful and particular worldview. The final change, from seeking a static answer to embracing motion, is earned through the ritual and the re-framing of the master's lesson, demonstrating a credible and poignant internal shift with a clear cost (accepting uncertainty).

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization as "kindly methodical" is powerfully demonstrated, not just stated; his motivation to connect is earned and deeply felt. His interiority is concrete, especially the sense memories tied to the tape fragments. The choice to reveal his own voice is a powerful culmination, though the line "He had cached them for her, though he hadn’t known her face" feels a touch too fated, slightly diminishing the agency of his choice in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira's characterization is compelling, rooted in a clear internal conflict between her scientific desire for control and her embodied terror. Her motivation is established early and drives the narrative effectively. The final moment of surrender feels earned, a believable shift compelled by overwhelming events, fulfilling the story's arc from rigid precision to fluid acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative from her opening murmur to her final sleep. Her interiority is palpable, particularly the physical exhaustion of insomnia. The character arc—reinterpreting her condition from a curse to a gift—is earned through the central exchange, making the final shift in perspective credible. The only minor weakness is the direct echo of "wryly earnest" in the old woman, a slight convergence that momentarily flattens their distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The clairvoyant is a compelling, tragic figure whose core contradiction drives the story’s poignant resolution. The pilgrim’s motivation is slightly abstract, positioning him more as a vessel for the story's theme than a character with deep, specific wants. However, his attempt to refuse the gift after understanding its cost provides a crucial moment of embodied internal conflict, earning his final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation as an archivist of absences is established immediately and drives every action with crystalline clarity. The internal conflict is beautifully embodied in the final beat—breathing through "staggered intervals of fear and forgiveness"—earning the story's climax without resorting to summary. The supporting characters, particularly the woman at the cemetery, possess startling depth in just a few lines, her motive for keeping the mouthpiece providing a perfect crucible for the archivist's final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between Alden's "analytically artistic mind" is not just stated but dramatized through his simultaneous impulse to map the supernatural while trembling with fear. The final confessions are specific, vulnerable, and avoid diagnostic language, earning the transformation. The contradictory impulses are held in perfect tension until the climax, where his final choice is both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s internal conflict as a “sympathetic skeptic” is dramatized with precision, not just stated. Her motivation to solve grief with reason provides a strong initial worldview that is credibly challenged and transformed. The pivotal micro-choice to “listen instead of refute” is an exemplary moment of character-in-action, fulfilling the “courageously kind” trait and earning the profound shift at the story’s close.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.6)
    Vey's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in an ancient ennui that is given specific texture by the memory of a lost lover. The transition from passive observer to active agent is driven by a perfect inciting incident, and his final choice is a powerful, earned culmination of his entire character arc. The secondary characters, though brief, are sketched with purpose and provide the necessary catalyst for the climax without distracting from the core focus.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.5)
    Cassidy's motivation is exceptionally clear, driven by a compelling internal contradiction: the daughter of a con artist pursuing a profoundly honest aim. Her actions are a perfect synthesis of this, using cunning inherited from her father to achieve a goal he could not. The final choice to sacrifice her most precious memory has a tangible, on-page cost, making her transformation from a girl waiting for her father's legacy to one who inverts it feel entirely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)
    Aurelia’s motivation is clear, specific, and directly fuels the climax. Her core trait, “earnestly studious,” is not merely stated but dramatized in the pivotal moment where she chooses understanding over caution, forcing the story's transformation. The final shift in her character—from a crafter of contained lies to a witness of sprawling truth—is earned and carries a palpable cost, reflected in her "heavier" heart.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by a powerful and consistent voice. The central motivation—to build an identity against bureaucratic erasure—is clear and compelling. The moment of internal conflict, where the poison label demands "loyalty to chemical endings" after the protagonist sees their own living face on tape, provides a superb moment of contradictory impulse that charges the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.5)
    Arlen’s characterization is superb, driven by the central contradiction of “gloomy cheerfulness.” His motivation is clear and his internal conflict—the debunker who craves surprise—is dramatized effectively through his actions. The transformation from a man who boasts “no mysteries, only measurements” to one who accepts an unvarnished, porous truth is earned through the crucible of retold memories, with the cost being his previous cynical certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lina's motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal conflict—the "dual allegiance" between preserving the carnival's soul and ensuring its survival at any cost—is introduced well. While her actions decisively favor preservation, this tension provides a credible psychological backdrop. Her self-declared role as "culture shock absorber" evolves into active resistance, demonstrating a strong, earned character arc. The choice to invent a new symbol at the end is a powerful crystallization of her growth from preserver to creator.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.5)
    The inspector’s motivation is crystalline and deeply felt, driving every action from the meticulous preparation of the sand-grain timer to the final, trembling press of the shutter. Her interiority is rendered with poetic precision, particularly in the line, “wondered if curiosity was just another form of mourning,” which elevates a personal mission into a profound thematic question. The character is revealed through her quiet, determined actions and embodied emotional responses, avoiding any declarative summary and earning her final, resonant stance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Lira’s motivation is compelling on both a practical (save the village) and philosophical level ("decode feedback into direction"). Her interiority is rendered with a powerful, specific perceptual signature tied to her blindness, making her "magnetic calm" under pressure feel earned and visceral rather than told.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.5)
    Maren’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction between professional duty and a deeper, almost spiritual curiosity. Her defining choice—ignoring the Registry’s hail to instead follow an instinct born of condensation patterns and a phrasebook—is perfectly motivated by her lifelong question. The final act of renouncing official documentation for mythic dissemination is a potent, earned culmination of her "subtly confident" nature, establishing a cost (professional dismissal) that solidifies her transformation.

    Elian’s motivation is powerfully established through the brief, potent backstory of his own broken bell. This personal history makes his final, sacrificial choice to offer his own heartbeat feel inevitable and deeply earned, not merely symbolic. The character’s interiority is conveyed through sensory, embodied details, such as feeling the fork’s hum as an “absence” that tugs at the “hollow inside his chest,” creating a compelling and consistent protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira’s motivation for survival is sharpened by her specific past as a cartographer and her emotional anchor to the lost world, embodied in the vial. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively when she overcomes her "instinct to flee" to push deeper, and the final choice to sacrifice her most precious memory for a chance at salvation is a powerful, earned beat that reveals her core values under ultimate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas's motivation is clear and potent: to understand and escape the inherited "sin" of his father's lie. The internal conflict between his label ("Cry-Wolf") and his nascent identity is dramatized through his choice to enter the labyrinth. The final declaration, "I forgive the silence, but I will not become it," is a powerful, earned moment of self-definition that is validated by the story's conclusion, demonstrating a complete and costly character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The ghost bride’s motivation is rooted in a beautifully rendered, paradoxical backstory of “lovingly venomous” care, creating a compelling internal conflict that drives the entire narrative. The boy is characterized effectively through his actions and fear-turned-understanding. The final choice, a mutual act of trust and release, is perfectly earned by the preceding beats of observation and shared memory.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Calyx is more of a mythic archetype than a complex individual, but he is executed perfectly within that frame. His motivation is clear and unwavering, and his core choices—surrendering to the dream, then sacrificing his blood—are embodied, have visible cost, and feel earned. The fusion of his inner "unrest" with the canyon's will provides a compelling, non-traditional engine for his actions, fulfilling the story's internal logic with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is crystalline and embodied from the first paragraph. Her choices—kneeling, mapping the light, using a polished rib for the gnomon—are specific, purposeful, and reveal a character deeply intertwined with her goal. The final change to a state of belonging is earned through these on-page actions. The internal conflict between exile and homecoming is resolved with a credible and moving finality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between revealing her true self and remaining anonymous is compellingly dramatized. The final choice to remain unread is an earned act of renunciation. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language, such as "to decide whether anonymity had protected or imprisoned her," which summarizes the core conflict rather than letting the character embody it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.6)
    The embroiderer's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is clear and her core contradiction—a quiet, foolish facade concealing sharp, strategic wisdom—is dramatized, not just stated. This is powerfully executed when her "quavering voice that sounded senile" directly precedes the decisive action of revealing the map, a choice earned by a story-long commitment to her method. The cost of this choice is made tangible by the lieutenant’s drawn pistol.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's motivation—a guilt "that festers in the pause after a slammed door"—is rendered with visceral, poetic interiority ("twenty-seven paper lungs collapsed"). The change at the climax is earned not through intellectual epiphany but through a simple, costly act of speech, making the final transformation credible and profound. Contradictory impulses are embodied throughout, culminating in a choice that is both simple and life-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's interiority is rendered with specific, embodied detail ("tongue still tasted of cordite and apologies," "ache in my sternum"), avoiding cliché. The internal conflict between professional duty and personal guilt is palpable, culminating in an earned emotional shift rather than a simple solution. The final choice to stay and reframe the trauma is a powerful act of renunciation and endurance, with the cost—the permanent ache—made clear.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Luma's motivation is clear and poetically rendered, driving her through a series of choices with palpable internal stakes. The change at the end is earned through the costly act of painting. The characterization is strong, though the final epiphany—"She realized joy had never been lost..."—is slightly too articulate, bordering on diagnostic summary rather than a purely embodied realization, which keeps it just shy of a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora's motivation undergoes a masterful, earned transformation from professional certainty to existential curiosity. The internal conflict is beautifully embodied in her actions—first her frustration with her familiar tools, then her choice to follow the nickel's pull. Her final choice to embrace the "path that curved out of sight" feels both surprising and inevitable, a perfect culmination of her arc, with the cost being the dissolution of her former, certain self.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlo’s character as a “charming rogue scholar” is realized through concrete action rather than labels. His motivation is clear and compelling, and his internal state of “nectar and nerves” contrasts effectively with his calculated external performance under pressure. The choice to use a Lucretius quote as both disarming classicism and an activation phrase is a superb moment of character-driven action that demonstrates his defining traits simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zale's characterization is exceptional, driven by a deeply embodied internal conflict between his profound exhaustion and an inherited, centuries-long duty. His motivation is not merely stated but felt through phrases like "exhaustion was a hollowing blade." The final choice to "plant the card" is a perfect culmination of his character arc, a renunciation of his vigil that is earned by the immense weight of his established suffering, providing a closure with palpable cost and relief.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira's motivation is established as duty and sharpens into personal sacrifice with the introduction of "Por," a masterful use of brief backstory. Her defining trait, "gently systematic," is not merely stated but embodied in the methodical, devastating process of self-erasure. The final, smiling acceptance of her fate is a powerful, earned character choice that demonstrates a complex internal state of fulfilled purpose and profound loss, satisfying the 9+ test of contradictory impulses culminating in a costly final act.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is powerful and deeply rooted in her family history, driving a credible and costly final choice. Her interiority is well-embodied, particularly the physical sensation of the "symphonies of truth." The characterization is slightly weakened by the concluding paragraph's direct articulation of her epiphany, which verges on summarizing an insight that the preceding actions had already powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireya’s characterization is exceptional, driven by an internal conflict between professional duty and a deeper, mentor-instilled ethic. Her motivation to “harmonize conflicting values” is made concrete through her ingenious, empathetic actions. Corin’s shift from antagonist to collaborator is swift but earned by the specific, disarming nature of Mireya’s invitation. The final realization that compassion was decrypted through a “trembling alliance of two fears” satisfyingly culminates her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mirela’s motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply embodied in her actions. The internal conflict between her need for erasure and her drive to preserve is potent. Mr. Blackwood serves as a well-motivated catalyst, his own loss creating a believable reason for offering sanctuary. The final earned change—from a woman balancing on a beam to one who has folded herself "into a dawn release of wings"—is poignant and well-supported by the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Juniper's motivation is clear and her interiority is richly imagined, particularly in how her grief and curiosity are embodied in action. The characterization is strong, but the final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, shifting from an embodied realization to a more declarative, conceptual summary. For instance, the line defining the sacredness of thresholds is intellectually precise but lacks the visceral punch of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation shifts compellingly from scientific observation to ritual participation, a change earned through concrete discoveries like the feather and the ghost. Her interiority is specific and lyrical, avoiding cliché. The final act of tearing the star atlas page is a powerful, embodied choice that demonstrates a decisive internal change, paying off her arc with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a powerful internal contradiction: she preserves memories for the world at the cost of her own. The revelation of her past choice provides a strong anchor for her character arc. However, the embodiment of her emotions occasionally gives way to summary, as when her final affirmation is presented as a list ("gratitude, love, wonder, peace") rather than a fully integrated experience.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cass’s motivation and methods are exceptionally clear and consistent, creating a cohesive character. Her competence is well-established, but it verges on infallibility, which flattens her internal landscape; we see the successful puppeteer, but not the struggle or contradictory impulses that would create deeper complexity. The characterization is more of an elegant proof of concept than a portrayal of a flawed, striving individual.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lysira’s motivation is both deeply personal and politically potent, established immediately through her choice of exile. Her internal conflict is beautifully embodied in the story’s central action, and the final transformation is a perfectly earned culmination of her established traits and desires, paid for with a clear on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is crystalline and her interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic detail. Her actions, from kneeling by the water to the final, decisive throw of the prism, are perfectly aligned with her established "private craft." The characterization is powerful and consistent, though it leans towards a perfected archetype rather than an individual with contradictory impulses acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's internal conflict is viscerally embodied through his connection to the porcelain box, his scarred chest, and the act of tasting the ash. The transformation from carrying a "mute ember" of guilt to becoming a commissioned speaker is earned through a credible, on-page emotional process. The phrase "hard softness" brilliantly captures his state, avoiding cliché and providing a specific, memorable emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira is a consistent and well-realized archetype, perfectly suited to this conceptual story. Her motivation as a 'logical dreamer' is clear, and her actions, from creating patterns to the blood sacrifice, align with this core contradiction. While her interiority is concrete, the story prioritizes the thematic mechanism over deep, messy internal conflict, keeping her just shy of the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation shifts organically from professional inquiry to a deeply personal, inherited quest. The transformation is driven by external discoveries rather than a pronounced internal struggle between contradictory impulses, which is a valid choice but slightly less dynamic. The final change is earned by the story's escalating logic, representing a complete, if horrifying, character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The painter’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—the need to become vulnerable to create truth after a career of elusive lies—is dramatized effectively. The transformation is earned through her on-page struggle with the mirrors, culminating in a credible and resonant change of purpose. The backstory of the stolen heartbeat provides a potent emotional anchor without slowing the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The negotiator's motivation and internal conflict are well-defined, and her transformation from a strategist to a bearer of grief feels earned. Her central choice—to muster the dead—is a powerful, character-defining act. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract, high-concept labels ("currency of human souls") rather than fully embodied emotion, which slightly distances the reader from her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The philanthropist's character is built on a compelling contradiction, with his sentimentality embodied in his weeping and trembling hands. His motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative. However, the story occasionally resorts to labels like "amoral philanthropist" or has him arrive at overly articulate self-realizations like "understanding that preservation required destruction," which slightly flatten the complexity by telling rather than fully dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lys's characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction of a "chaste courtesan" seeking to unleash raw emotion is powerfully rendered through embodied interiority, such as her blood answering the plinth "in iambs." Her motivation is clear and her final choice to remain and sing—refusing to become an echo herself—is an earned, resonant culmination of her arc, foreclosing the path of escape for a higher purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lucien's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between aesthetic purity and social duty is well-drawn. The backstory with his grandmother provides a credible root for his skills and philosophy. The final change is earned through the crucible of the story-stick vision, showing a believable evolution from urbane elitist to a more complex public artist, though the speed of this profound shift borders on abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization as an "esoteric realist" is earned through her actions: the practical, delicate craft of wire-knotting is paired with a deeply spiritual, abstract motivation. Her interiority is revealed with precision, especially in the final moment of crying from "loss or completion," which is a beautifully rendered, contradictory emotional state. The motivation, rooted in her grandmother's philosophy, provides a clear and compelling engine for the narrative without feeling like a simple info-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation, rooted in a vividly rendered past trauma ("smashed his master’s organ"), is both clear and complex. The internal journey from guilt to a state of quiet purpose is earned through the on-page act of forgiveness, which directly enables the story's central action. The final shift in understanding preservation is a profound and credible character change, moving from a maker of static objects (bells) to a carrier of living vibrations.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is potent and voice-driven, serving the story's conceptual aims perfectly. Motivation is established clearly and fulfilled through a transformation that feels earned by the preceding dream sequence. The protagonist's internal state is rendered with concrete, specific embodiment ("circuits branching blue across her ribs"), and the cost of her change—the loss of self—is made tangible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.5)
    Naram-bel's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in his "frugal" nature and "encrypted devotion." The internal conflict between his scientific skepticism and his faith in the tile is palpable, resolving not in a simple victory for one side but in a synthesis. His final renunciation is fully earned by the preceding events, and the cost—his physical presence in the world—is made tangible in the haunting final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s core contradiction as a “scheming pacifist” is compelling, and her motivation is clear. The climactic turn where she confronts her shadow-self is powerful, demonstrating an earned change. However, a few moments of interiority read as overly diagnostic authorial summary rather than in-the-moment character thought, slightly flattening her voice, as seen in the line about the “calculus of vengeance.”

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mirror maker's motivation is established with compelling specificity and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict culminates in a moment of hesitation that is both believable and pivotal. The character's final change is earned through the dream's reflection, a clever externalization of an internal epiphany that avoids unearned diagnostic awareness. The contradiction—a man erasing boundaries who has bound himself—provides a strong, resonant closure to his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mender’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, rooted in both professional vows and personal love (the ribbon). Her interiority is conveyed with concrete, specific emotion, such as the “endearingly feisty curses” that reveal character through action. The final choice to answer her daughter with “accidental wisdom” demonstrates an earned change in perspective, fulfilling her arc with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is deeply convincing, rooted in her specific intellectual history. The backstory of her three bathroom breakthroughs provides a solid, unique foundation for her climactic fourth realization, making her ultimate refusal of forbidden knowledge feel earned and character-particular rather than a stock moral choice. The internal conflict between intellectual curiosity and the dread of entrapment is embodied and sustained perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her defining trait—“carefully resourceful”—is demonstrated through concrete, inventive actions rather than being merely stated. The choice to trade a year of her life provides a tangible cost, grounding her high-minded goal. While her internal conflict is more about problem-solving than contradictory impulses, her competence under pressure is rendered as a powerful form of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassia's motivation is established with poetic precision and her internal transformation is earned through the story's central trial. The character's core conflict is externalized beautifully in the funhouse mirror scene, showing contradictory selves without resorting to summary. The chimera serves as an effective archetypal guide, and its dialogue is potent and memorable, defining the story's central conceit with "I don’t give solace... only the unkindled kind." The final integration feels both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from note-taking to the final merging of threads. Her defining trait as an "adaptable archivist" is demonstrated rather than merely stated. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction or internal conflict; she reads as a near-perfect instrument for the tower's purpose, which slightly flattens her characterization and prevents the highest score.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The mapkeeper's motivation is established with poetic precision and immediately dramatized through her actions. Her internal state is masterfully embodied, particularly the physical threat of her own body turning to melody, which raises the personal stakes at the climax. The micro-choices—pressing the stone to Jalen's lips, projecting silence for the Warden—are perfectly aligned with her established skills and worldview, demonstrating a character whose expertise is her only weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong and specific. The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, and her interiority, particularly the sensory experience of retrocognition, is vividly rendered. The final transformation from cursed to blessed is earned through her arduous journey. However, the final paragraph's self-awareness ("She understood then that...") veers slightly into diagnostic summary, diluting the embodied emotion of the climax by telling the reader the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The archivist's motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" is beautifully complicated by her personal desire to "thicken" her own thin life with memories. This internal conflict is dramatized perfectly through her choices: taking a memory for herself, then paying tribute with a piece of her own history. The final shift from hoarder to witness is an earned, resonant change, paid for with the cost of her own footprint dissolving into legend.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.3)
    Luma's motivation is established with poetic precision and immediately tested. Her interiority is revealed through specific, embodied actions—the chant, touching the threshold, the laugh that is "half sob, half fuse." The character's core contradiction, creating beauty while fleeing from its aftermath, is resolved in the final choice to release her most private art, earning a change that feels both personal and mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The chronicler’s interiority is rendered with concrete, particular detail, and her defining trait—her “tangential” worldview—is not just stated but fully embodied in her perceptions and actions. The daughter is sketched with fewer strokes, but her hesitant arrival and acceptance of the cicada are potent choices. The final earned change, a shift from silent tension to a "tidal" conversation, is entirely credible, with the cost being the shared vulnerability required to re-engage.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira's motivation—to stretch her claustrophobic lungs by collecting silences—is both unique and psychologically resonant. Her internal conflict is powerfully dramatized in the final choice between her stated goal (collecting) and her deeper need (release), a contradiction that pays off with a palpable sense of earned freedom. The micro-choices, like stepping only three planks forward, embody her fear and caution perfectly, making her eventual ascent and renunciation feel earned and substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.5)
    Nilo’s motivation to cultivate and teach silence is established immediately and drives all his micro-choices, from slowing the gondola to his final, quiet smile. The commuter's internal conflict is economically but powerfully embodied through his shallow breath and drumming pulse. The story achieves a rare balance where Nilo's competence and the commuter's vulnerability feel equally authentic, making the final earned change in the commuter—"lighter by one confession"—deeply credible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lore keeper's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks a compelling internal conflict. She proceeds with unwavering competence, and while her final realization is thematically resonant, it reads as an intellectual acceptance rather than an embodied, costly choice born from struggle. A hint of personal doubt or a flaw that complicates her otherwise perfect execution would have elevated the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is compelling, with her "perverse art" of suffocation creating a powerful contradiction. Her motivation is clear and embodied. However, the dialogue during the climax—"You're teaching me to suffocate so I can breathe?"—reads as diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the earned nature of the character's epiphany into a thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lira’s motivation is established with visceral specificity in the opening and remains the unwavering core of her actions. Her interiority is sharp and contradictory; the “virtuously mischievous grin” is a perfect character beat that pays off when she decides forgiveness is a currency to be spent, not just felt. The final choice to discard the diamond is a powerful, earned renunciation that demonstrates a profound character change—seeking liberation over mere financial restitution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.5)
    Arin's motivation is the clear, unwavering engine of the narrative, and the transformation from "last cartographer of the Vale dynasty" to a nameless heir seeking new names is profound and earned. The internal conflict is established efficiently ("though the title stung, it also carved purpose into marrow"), and the final choice is paid for with a visible, symbolic cost. The characterization is exceptional, with every action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sir Calen’s transformation from "withdrawn" to "opening" is earned through a series of concrete internal choices and embodied reactions. The interiority is specific and powerful, particularly the moment of "shivering bliss." The score is capped below the 9-band because his final, decisive action—the one that should seal his character change—is rendered ambiguous by the story's incomplete final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.6)
    Rowan's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is established early ("waiting for one small kindness to magnify") and is paid off with a precise, believable action. The backstory of her own intake experience is integrated seamlessly, providing a powerful and concrete anchor for her decision to place the button in Marcus's file. The internal conflict between her inherited heartbreak and her "tactfully hopeful" nature is dramatized, not stated, culminating in a final choice that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira's motivation is clear, consistent, and embodied through action rather than summary. Her core trait of being "carefully resourceful" is demonstrated on the page through her timing of the drones and technical skill. The final choice—surrendering with the key held high—is a powerful act of defiance that feels earned and costs her freedom, satisfying the criteria for an exceptional character arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The saxophonist’s motivation is crystalline, and his interiority is embodied entirely through his musical actions and sensory perceptions, avoiding abstract summary. The central conflict is beautifully externalized in his specific choices—a diminished chord that tastes of rust, a trill like a snake devouring its tail—which makes his struggle tangible and compelling. The final act of endurance is earned with a clear, cyclical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireya’s motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and rooted in her character as an “orderly seed sorter” who seeks balance, not glory. Her internal state is well-embodied, particularly the contrast between her trembling knees and precise hands. The internal litany of “barley, rye, emmer, hope” is a masterful touch, revealing her core values under pressure. Her final choice to speak the name is earned through her methodical work and culminating understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's transformation from a mender of certainty to a master of uncertainty is compelling and earned. His motivation is clarified in a powerful, embodied choice: wading into the freezing water for the compass. The internal conflict is dramatized beautifully in the line "beneath the ashes of routine he discovered he wanted the uncertainty the compass promised, not the certainty it replaced," showing a contradictory impulse that solidifies into a life-altering decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Alder's motivation is intensely clear and embodied through his alchemical worldview. The internal conflict between his grief and his need for balance is dramatized through concrete actions, not just summarized. The final shift to a new equilibrium—accepting grief as a "precise weight"—is an earned stasis, a powerful and credible resolution for the character. The contradiction between his rational alchemist's mind and his mystical grief is handled with sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's characterization is rendered with superb economy. Her defining trait, "modestly fearless," is not merely stated but dramatized through her quiet, deliberate actions and her unique method of communication ("spoke—not with voice but with the modestly fearless silence she carried like a second skeleton"). Her motivation is clear and compelling, and her interiority is conveyed through potent, specific imagery rather than exposition, avoiding any diagnostic self-awareness. The character is deeply realized and consistent, with her core contradiction—a gentle collector of painful fragments—driving the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)
    Motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, and the interiority is rendered with striking, specific embodiment via the sci-fi conceits. The protagonist's internal conflict between intellectualizing pain ("the mathematics of mercy") and enduring its raw physical manifestation is powerful. The final choice is earned and forecloses the path of seeking perfect absolution with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation to seek "overlooked histories" is established early and brilliantly focused into a deeply personal, embodied internal conflict. The final choice to return the fragment is a profound and earned change, moving from a collector of memories to a facilitator of release. The cost of this change is made palpable in the line "its absence weighs more than its presence ever did," fulfilling the highest standard for character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a compelling fusion of blue-collar competence and supernatural sensitivity. Her motivation evolves organically from a practical goal (the mainspring) to a spiritual responsibility, with the final realization that the "cracks in the façade" are internal providing an earned, resonant change. The contradiction of being an "unwilling" seer who nonetheless engages ghosts with firm politeness creates a subtle, consistent internal conflict that pays off in her final choice to carry their burden.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Corwin’s motivation is rooted in a compellingly abstract need—to fill the “cracked chase” of his heart—which is perfectly suited to the story's mythic register. His internal conflict is embodied in his trembling hands versus his determined actions. The transformation from a preserver of a stolen moment to an active agent of cosmic change is earned and resonant, culminating in his soundless laughter, a powerful indicator of his new state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aurelio’s characterization is exceptional. His motivation—to find meaning in the wreckage of his ideals—is rendered with precision, moving from embodied despair (pressing the shard into his palm) to a form of transcendent agency. The internal conflict between futility and the poetic impulse is dramatized, not stated, culminating in an earned final choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. Mira serves as a necessary catalyst without stealing focus, her reverence providing the perfect audience for Aurelio's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally well-layered. The shift from a civic duty (save the city) to a deeply personal and vulnerable one (reclaim his daughter's colors) provides a powerful, earned engine for the climax. The confession, "I have repaired a thousand boxes yet left her lullaby unfinished," is a moment of profound internal conflict that perfectly justifies the magical system's response.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.6)
    Ivy's characterization is exceptional, defined by a specific, compelling motivation—to find where explanations fail—that is dramatized, not just stated. Her defining trait of being "sensibly eccentric" is perfectly embodied in her actions and attire, particularly the waistcoat of vials. The moment "Terror arrived, then politeness excused it" is a masterful piece of interiority, revealing a complex, contradictory impulse in a moment of crisis that feels deeply true and specific.

    Maela’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a consistent and compelling internal motivation to understand the world through her art. Her core trait, "perpetually learning," is not just stated but demonstrated in her every observation and action, culminating in the choice to trust the "unmarked map" over the GPS. The story masterfully embodies her internal state, with contradictory impulses (the desire for answers vs. surrendering to the storm's lesson) resolving into a decisive, earned creative act.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a motivation that is both abstract (understanding night) and deeply personal (unresolved grief). Her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion, particularly in the line describing winter melting inside her as a “slow drip of old grief.” The final earned change, moving from painting dawn to knowing how to paint the “tender umbral blue,” is entirely credible and forecloses her old artistic path with a palpable sense of release.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mireya’s motivation is crystalline and her defining trait as an archivist drives every choice. The moment of internal conflict preceding the climax—"I could have walked away... Instead I..."—is executed with powerful economy, demonstrating a complex choice between personal shame and public duty. The final act is a perfect, earned culmination of her established values, with the cost of being "crowned... or crucify me" made explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Veyra's characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear and consistent motivation—to reject false comfort and build from memory. Her internal conflict is embodied in her relationship with the amber bottle, and her final choice to smash it is a perfectly earned renunciation with a visible cost. The slight tendency towards overly articulate, diagnostic interiority ("civilization could be reimagimagined...") is a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.4)
    Ambrose's characterization is superb. His motivation to archive and preserve is immediately challenged by the living, changing nature of the prophecy, creating a compelling internal conflict. The backstory of his childhood is not just exposition but the causal key to the climax, perfectly earning his final shift from resistance to acceptance. The choice to make him born speaking dead languages is a brilliant conceit that makes his unique understanding feel innate rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and her internal state is rendered with exceptional, concrete interiority. Her final choice to remain as archivist is a credible renunciation, earned through the dramatized struggle and her grandmother’s wisdom. The contradictory impulses—the grating feeling of borrowed time versus the resolve to hold steady—are embodied in scene, culminating in the powerful state of being “furiously tranquil.”

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation—a blend of scientific curiosity, filial piety, and intuitive connection to the mountain—is established with concise, potent details like the scent of her father's soap on the rope. The internal conflict between civic duty and a deeper listening is dramatized, not stated, culminating in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. Her final state of "humbled quiet" is a perfectly earned change, demonstrating a profound shift in worldview with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The janitor's motivation and internal arc are clear and compelling, with his final choice to leave the lantern feeling earned. The characterization is strong, showing a consistent internal state of gentle grief and curiosity. However, the emotional progression is slightly too linear, lacking moments of sharp internal contradiction that would elevate it to exceptional; the change feels more like a serene evolution than a struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Alden’s motivation is exceptionally clear and is earned through the compelling backstory of the first ghost. His internal conflict is dramatized effectively in the final beats, leading to a choice that is both a sacrifice (breaking his silence) and an affirmation. The characterization is deeply integrated with the story's core concept, and his final action feels inevitable and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.4)
    The timekeeper’s motivation is singular and potent, driving every action from examining the time capsule to trading his relic. His internal state is rendered with exceptional physical specificity, like the "texture shift inside his ribs," which embodies his conceptual breakthrough. The character’s arc from a collector of quantitative time to a trader of qualitative experience is earned and feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and his internal arc is consistent with the story's thematic goals. However, the epiphany feels overly articulated, as if summarized by the narrator rather than experienced by the character ("The poet’s task, he understood suddenly, was not to finish the chord..."). The woman functions more as a well-chosen symbol to facilitate his change than as a character with independent interiority, which is acceptable for this mode but keeps the characterization from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mateo’s motivation is established with profound clarity and is inextricably linked to his core trait of being "gently systematic." His terminal diagnosis isn't a source of despair but of permission, a motivation that feels both unique and deeply human. The final choice to join the circuit is the ultimate expression of his life's work, a powerful and earned action that aligns perfectly with the characterization built throughout the piece. His internal state is conveyed through his meticulous actions rather than overt summary.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dr. Voss's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in the compelling traits of a "luminous skeptic" and "academically rebellious" nature. Her interiority is sharp and analytical, fitting her profession. The character is slightly held back by the use of these labels, which sometimes stand in for dramatized action, but her final, earned resolve to act provides a strong, satisfying arc with a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.5)
    The coachman’s motivation is singular, powerful, and expressed through every action. His internal conflict is brilliantly encapsulated in the recurring motif of the “narrow vastness,” which acts as a barometer for his emotional state. The final change—the vastness widening “enough to let breath move without pain”—is a perfectly earned and embodied resolution, directly triggered by the sight of the first shoot. His competence (speaking dead languages) is balanced by his vulnerability (the quivering grief).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly for Scraps. Her motivation to "translate distance into closeness" is a powerful, non-standard driver that elegantly connects her past trauma to her present actions. Her internal conflict is shown through her weariness with death-finding versus the "old tug" she feels for the living. The way her actions are filtered through her unique hound-senses makes her interiority concrete and specific, fully earning the final, resonant shift in her role from a retired tool of war to a "courier teaching distance how to kneel."

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s motivation is powerfully established through the grief ritual, and his interiority is sharp and specific (“eyes ringed with the guilt of surviving”). The internal conflict between rational knowledge (the compass is a lie) and deep emotional need is dramatized effectively, making his final choice to take his mother's hand feel both surprising and inevitable. The cost of this choice is earned and made tangible by the epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vespers’ motivation as an “apprentice of wonder” is established through consistent, specific actions rather than exposition, from singing a lullaby backwards to the final, “sacredly playful” invitation. The sacrifice of her queen, revealing the memory of her core choice, is a masterful moment of characterization under pressure. Halcyon is an effective foil, and their dynamic is crucible-like, forcing the story’s central choice with minimal but potent dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mara's backstory as a crisis actor provides a potent, earned contrast for her present reality, making her choices feel both skilled and psychologically resonant. Kestrel's shift from a boy in a training film to a man speaking his "first unrehearsed line" is a powerful, economical arc. The crucible of their interaction forges a believable alliance, with the final choice to leave together feeling like an earned, high-stakes commitment rooted in their shared past and present purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, stemming from a well-defined internal conflict between the pain of memory and the need for truth. Her transformation feels earned, culminating in a courageous choice that is directly responsive to the story's central pressures. The backstory reveal is efficient and potent, providing a solid foundation for her initial state and final change.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marek’s motivation is expertly rendered, rooted in his professional pride and personal guilt. His internal conflict is dramatized concretely through his interactions with the story's central symbols—the labyrinth and the tapestry. The character change is earned through a specific, on-page intellectual and emotional process, culminating in a credible shift from a man seeking to solve guilt to one who accepts it. The phrase "fierce repose" returning with a new, deeper meaning is a masterful touch.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation—to reframe a burdensome truth—is established immediately and provides a powerful internal engine for the story. The central contradiction between her defiant artist persona and her private guilt is dramatized effectively, culminating in an earned epiphany that isn't a tidy resolution but a complex acceptance of cost. The shift from a defiant speaker to a receptive listener is a profound and credible change, making her final resolve to paint again feel like a genuine transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied. The internal conflict between her goal (“meaning”) and survival is perfectly dramatized in the climax, where her choice feels both tragic and inevitable. Her “uncertain alchemist’s hands” contrast powerfully with the steady voice of her narration, showing a complex internal state without summary. The final choice is earned through the story's tight causality and consistent characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb. The arc from an "intimately aloof" man defeated by time to one who embodies a new, powerful version of that same trait is perfectly executed. The change is earned through the central discovery, with the shift marked by the line "intimately aloof no longer," and its final reconfiguration is a masterstroke of thematic closure. The motivation, rooted in an unspoken artistic promise, is compelling and drives the entire narrative without fault.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. Motivation is established immediately and tied to a concrete object and a core belief system, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The protagonist’s interiority is rendered with specific, contradictory, and memorable language, particularly "the screaming tenderness of someone who has loved a broken thing too long." The final micro-choice—to beckon, not wave—is a perfect, earned crystallization of her internal shift, showing a change in her relationship to the world and her grief.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with poetic precision in the second paragraph and remains the unwavering core of every action. Her interiority is uniquely embodied in the concept of being "stitched together," a metaphor made concrete through her actions, like soldering her own hair. The final transformation into "the offering" is a powerful, earned change, fulfilling the initial motive at the cost of her individual self, which is a perfect execution of a character arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation for "safety" is immediately clear and powerfully grounded in the post-plague context. Her internal conflict between ingrained rationality and the undeniable supernatural relic is the story's engine. The final transformation, particularly the non-apology to her sister's ghost, demonstrates a profound and earned change, moving from occluding guilt to a form of fractured acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.5)
    Maris is a superbly drawn character for this length. Her motivation to decode the gesture is established immediately and drives every action. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, unique imagery ("humming in her bones the way fog hums in a bell"), avoiding cliché. The final choice to sacrifice her own memories for a "cleaner" isolation is a powerful, earned change, showing a complex hierarchy of values where dutiful solitude outweighs personal history.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear, stemming from a potent combination of grief, loneliness, and his mother's promise. His obsession is embodied in his physical actions, from tracing maps to following the ants. The final change—accepting his own life and unlocking the door—is an earned and powerful shift, directly resulting from the climax without feeling sentimental. The internal conflict between yearning for escape and accepting reality is palpable and resolves with genuine insight.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.5)
    The queen's motivation is potent and clear, evolving from fear of erasure to a deliberate, costly acceptance of her role in the causal loop. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, evocative imagery (e.g., "air thinned into lace... a lacy menace"), avoiding abstraction. The final choice feels both inevitable and devastating, a perfectly earned culmination of her disenchantment being replaced by a profound, tragic purpose. The character arc is complete, powerful, and lands with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Corin's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-defined, with the final choice feeling earned through Mira's catalytic action. The characterization is very strong, but slightly undercut by interiority that occasionally slips into diagnostic self-awareness, such as naming the "scientifically romantic paradox that had haunted him," which states the theme more than embodying the struggle in that specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict—her professional need to impose narrative order versus her lived experience of time collapsing—is vividly rendered. Emotions are specific and embodied, as in the "feral nostalgia bite" and "jaded wonder rattling in her ribs." The final choice to accept her state rather than fight it is a powerful act of renunciation, earned by the preceding psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mira’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal journey from loss to reframed purpose is compelling and earned. Her contradictory impulses—the grief for her old life versus the flicker of hope in the new—are dramatized through her interaction with the screw. The final choice to accept her new role is sealed with the physical act of pocketing the screw, a cost-bearing commitment to her new identity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lina’s motivation to “transform scars into stories” is deeply embodied and consistent, driving every micro-choice. Her internal conflict is dramatized with concrete, physical sensations—the crystallization of breath, the heartbeat like a “rune gone wrong”—avoiding abstraction. The single moment of doubt regarding her Master’s teachings adds a layer of genuine intellectual and emotional friction, making her final perseverance more earned. Master Jomei serves his purpose as a stable anchor without pulling focus, which is appropriate for a single-POV piece of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is superb, achieving a rare balance of economy and depth. Mirage’s internal conflict—the cynical professional versus the guilt-ridden lover—is dramatized through her actions, from the initial verbal jab to the final written confession. The line “I mistook your depression for possession because haunting sells better than hurting” is a devastatingly precise moment of self-awareness that earns her change, foreclosing her past identity with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Witness’s motivation is clear and her transformation is earned through the story's events, culminating in a profound change with a legible cost—the dissolution of self. Her interiority is expressed through potent, embodied metaphors. The characterization is slightly held back from the highest tier only because her internal conflict is presented as a linear transformation rather than a moment-to-moment struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Torvald's motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling personal grief that grounds the story's high-concept premise. His progression from dutiful shepherd to a reality-bending agent is earned within the story's logic. However, the character's interiority occasionally slips into an overly articulate, authorial voice that states the story's theme directly, as in "Understanding what clocks really measure required abandoning the... notion that time moved in only one direction," which feels less like an organic thought and more like a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Maya’s motivation is deeply personal and consistently drives her actions, from the initial investigation to the final, difficult choice. The internal conflict at the climax—pitting the desire to "reclaim original Luc" against the data showing "no original, no copy—only choice"—is a powerful, earned moment of transformation. Her specialized competence is believably fused with her emotional vulnerability, making her a compelling and complete character.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear and compelling internal conflict between the "rational" and "reckless" sides, rooted in a well-drawn relationship with her father. Her motivation is complex, layered between a stated intellectual curiosity and a deeper emotional quest. The line "the turnstile clicked once for her, once for her father’s ghost she refused to admit she was chasing" powerfully externalizes this. The final choice is earned, though the epiphany is articulated a bit too diagnostically, slightly softening the impact of an otherwise excellent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is powerfully established through the concrete image of cultivating estrangement “like orchids.” The internal conflict between this cultivated isolation and the pull of connection is palpable, culminating in a final choice that feels earned. The single line, “Let it teach you beginnings while I stay and teach endings how to begin,” verges on being too explicit a thematic statement, slightly abstracting a moment that is otherwise deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is masterful. The archivist’s motivation is established immediately and deepens into a complex internal conflict between personal and collective memory. Her final, sacrificial choice to place the locket in the tube is a powerful, earned action, with the cost felt physically in the "clean nail wound" of its absence. The contradiction of her "haunted euphoria" is beautifully dramatized, showing rather than telling her complex state.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s characterization is superb, established with concise, potent phrases (“breaker of supply chains and hearts”) and consistently demonstrated through action. Her “desperately jocular” nature is not just a label; it fuels the central knock-knock joke exchange, providing a perfect crucible for her transformation from a weary performer to someone capable of genuine laughter. The internal conflict between her professional competence and personal hollowness is palpable, and her final choice to board the spectral train feels earned, signifying a renunciation of her old, static solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is superb, with motivation and internal conflict established with poetic precision. The mapmaker's emotions are embodied through a unique sensory palette, and his final transformation is earned through a credible, on-page struggle. The line "to navigate uncharted emotional depths one must become the map" verges on being slightly too declarative, but it lands after such a profound sensory experience that it reads as earned wisdom rather than a thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a deeply realized and consistent interiority. The central contradiction of being "confidently uncertain" is dramatized effectively, particularly in the climax where "uncertainty steadied her hand." The emotional arc from regret to a state of earned acceptance is palpable and convincing; her final actions feel like a genuine evolution of her worldview. While the focus is almost entirely internal, the embodiment of her emotional state through physical sensations grounds the character beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established with poetic precision and her actions—from the performative click of the empty camera to the final act of self-acceptance—are entirely consistent with it. The internal conflict between grief and creation is beautifully embodied, culminating in an earned change of stance. The advisor is a successful catalyst, applying gentle pressure without overshadowing the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ember’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in the promise to her grandmother. However, her interiority relies heavily on declarative labels like "analytically intuitive mind" and repeated phrases like "volcanic tenderness" instead of dramatizing these traits through contradictory impulses in the scene. The final realization feels more like an intellectual summary ("she herself was the final artwork") than a deeply embodied, earned emotional shift, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undermines the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mara's motivation—to reunite with her sister by subverting the experiment that killed her—is potent and clear. Her interiority is beautifully embodied through the central action of drumming, turning grief into a tangible force. The internal conflict between her half-life and the desire for wholeness is resolved in a final choice that feels both tragic and transcendent, a renunciation of her physical form that is earned by every preceding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is clean and effective, with motivations clearly established for both Mira and the stranger. Mira's competence is well-drawn through her reliance on maps and sensory acuity. The interaction feels slightly frictionless, with trust established very quickly, which softens the potential for interpersonal tension but serves the story's focus on mystery and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guardian's characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction between her past self (a child who "gave away secrets like sweets") and her present, silent form. Her motivation is abstract but made concrete through her methodical actions. The moment she accepts her mouthless face in the mirror is a potent display of earned stoicism, and her final choice to communicate through a silent, patterned dance rather than words demonstrates a profound, earned change with a visible cost (her eternal duty).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and compelling, rooted in her unique perception of the world. Her actions are decisive and aligned with her established character as a quiet rebel. The introduction of Ellis and the other townspeople provides effective, if brief, pressure that validates her worldview, though her own internal conflict during the execution of her plan is more implied than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, with her core conflict between duty and motion embodied in specific, compelling actions. Her history as a dancer is masterfully integrated into her present as a dock worker, creating a consistent internal self that refuses to be coarsened by war. The final choice feels earned and motivated, though the explicit definition of freedom ("not escape but...") verges on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful, embodied epiphany of unmaking the harpoon.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, achieving depth through concise, potent details. The performer's moral ambiguity, established by her history of both reporting neighbors and forging joy coupons, creates a compelling internal contradiction that grounds her present actions. Her subtle shift, marked by feeling "lighter in the shoulders," is earned through the ritualistic performance, representing a credible change rather than an unearned epiphany. The officer's parallel arc, from observer to participant, strengthens the theme of shared, tentative healing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet's characterization is powerful, functioning as a mythic archetype driven by a clear, unwavering philosophical motivation. Her interiority is beautifully externalized; her "tremor of certainty" becomes a literal force that interacts with the quartz and ice. The arc is not one of changing motivation but of successful enactment, with her final state of "certain only of motion" feeling earned and consistent with her creed of dissolving boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong, particularly for Milo, whose motivation for an impossible color is a compelling driver. His transformation is earned through the crucible of his new, painful vision. Rosa functions effectively as a catalyst, though her interiority remains opaque, fitting the fable-like tone. Their relationship, built through the non-verbal "conversation of thorns and petals," serves as an excellent crucible for their shared awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bell ringer's motivation is clear, but her characterization leans heavily on her symbolic function. Her swift, successful persuasion of the collectors lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she reads more as a vessel for the story's thesis than a person grappling with a difficult internal shift. The other characters exist only as a passive chorus, affirming her epiphany without challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict between static preservation and dynamic acceptance is legible. Her actions—folding the origami—are a perfect external manifestation of her internal shift. However, the character’s final realization is articulated with a degree of diagnostic clarity ("teaching the dead to bloom again meant accepting their transformation") that feels slightly unearned, stepping back from embodied experience into thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a compelling blend of intellectual curiosity and inherited responsibility. Her actions are meticulously aligned with her goals, and the final choice to accept the cyclical pattern is a well-earned moment of renunciation. While the character serves as a perfect lens for the story's concept, a lack of demonstrated contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene keeps her just below the highest tier of dynamic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and evolves under pressure, culminating in an earned transformation. Her internal conflict between duty (purification) and self-preservation (identity) is powerfully dramatized. The moment of "anguished joy" is a superb, embodied resolution of contradictory impulses, leading to a choice with a visible cost—the abandonment of her old role for a new, heavier one.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear, deepening from a professional quest to a personal promise with an earned epiphany. The internal conflict with the "shadow unbound" is well-embodied, and her final act of renunciation feels both surprising and inevitable, carrying a profound and legible cost—her own "vanishing." This is exemplary character work for this length, with a final choice perfectly earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Miren’s internal conflict is expertly rendered through concrete action, particularly the ritual of shedding her professional insignia. The motivation is clear and the arc from fragile conviction to humble doubt is earned. The score is held back slightly by moments of over-articulated interiority, such as stating her motivation "was to balance self-reckoning and compassion," which veers close to diagnostic summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is powerfully established and drives the entire narrative arc. Interiority is rendered with exceptional, concrete detail (e.g., "tasting iron and lilac," "meteor hush"), avoiding cliché. The final change—from a wound as a "question mark" to a "period"—is earned through a visceral, on-page choice, fulfilling the character's initial goal with a profound internal shift and a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is specific, deeply rooted in her past, and drives every action. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular detail (e.g., her "spatially imaginative mind"). The final change is earned through her persistence and willingness to engage with the theater's magic, representing a credible resolution of her internal conflict with a clearly felt cost—the final acceptance of her mother's goodbye.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dreamer's motivation is primal and clear, rooted effectively in the backstory of suppressed creativity. Her actions, from dragging the relic to dismantling it, are powerful embodiments of her internal state. The characterization is more archetypal than individual, serving as a potent vessel for the theme, which prevents a higher score. However, her final, costly choice is earned and aligns perfectly with her established values.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guard is an archetypal figure whose motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent: a duty to memory. While not psychologically complex, his interiority is perfectly conveyed through his ritualistic actions and perception of the surreal world. The final choice to plant the clock is not just an action but an earned renunciation of his personal talisman, demonstrating a hierarchy of values with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    The philosopher's motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict at the climax—hesitating to release the gear—provides a moment of genuine, contradictory impulse. While she functions somewhat archetypally, her decisive choice is earned through the story's progression, and the cost is made tangible in the memory of "childhood cinnamon." The transformation is profound and grounded in this single, pivotal act of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Characterization is functional, with Marta as the wise mentor and Jun as the capable apprentice. The hound's motivation is clear, but its resolution relies on a summarized epiphany ("having discovered that the courage...had been within all along") rather than a fully dramatized moment of change. While the actions are consistent, the internal shifts are somewhat over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic label-speak that slightly flattens the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. The bellhop's internal conflict between remembered sound and enforced silence is made tangible through physical tells like the "tension of his jaw." His motivation is clear, and his micro-choices—giving the bolt, holding the boy's gaze, remaining—are freighted with immense weight, demonstrating a powerful hierarchy of values. The final earned stasis, where he waits, is a masterful depiction of endurance as a profound choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The titan's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the plot with elegant precision. His character is conveyed through action and a distinct, "regally unpretentious" air. However, the protagonist's journey lacks any meaningful internal conflict or struggle; his competence is absolute, and the plan unfolds without a single misstep, which slightly lessens the character's depth and the tension of his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's motivation as a long-suffering witness is clear and consistent, driving her actions from ritual to investigation. Her interiority is conveyed effectively through evocative, embodied moments like the "eel waking in her chest." The final transformation of her purpose is earned by the story's events, providing a credible character arc, though a deeper sense of her internal contradictions before the inciting incident would have elevated it further.

    The stargazer’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation that sharpens under pressure. The transformation from “awkwardly confident” to a confidence “welded to bone” is earned through the story’s central ordeal. Her interiority is conveyed through a distinct perceptual filter—seeing galaxies in nests—and her final choice feels like the inevitable culmination of her established traits and the mystical pressure applied to them.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)
    Nara’s characterization is exceptional, balancing her past as a violent insurgent (“little peach”) with her present, more subtle rebellion. Her motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss and ideological conviction, making her choices feel both inevitable and potent. The story earns its 9+ by showing contradictory impulses in action: when confronted by the guard, she uses her unique, life-affirming power to pacify, not harm, embodying her goal to “evolve tradition” rather than merely repeat cycles of violence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is intensely clear and their interiority is rendered with exceptional, particular detail. The internal conflict between survival as a “clerical error” and the will to continue is embodied, not just stated. The choice to repurpose the therapist's term "somatic markers" into a private, visceral system is a brilliant character-specific detail that elevates the narrative beyond simple trauma processing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained by grief, driving his every action. His interiority is rich but leans heavily on abstract, philosophical questions, occasionally bordering on diagnostic self-awareness rather than embodied emotion. The moment "Elian understood then that to descend..." feels more like a thematic summary than a psychologically earned realization, a minor slip that abstracts the character’s internal shift at a key pivot point.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear, specific, and drives the entire narrative. The central emotional concept of "serene anger" is well-maintained and believably transforms into acceptance, earning the final choice. The characterization avoids cliché, presenting a competent protagonist whose internal state is revealed through focused action and minimal, effective interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sera’s motivation is clear and compelling, escalating from a professional duty to a personal, rediscovered purpose. The internal conflict is established but sometimes relies on summary ("bravely conflicted") rather than purely embodied action. The final reflection ("a woman half ice, half fire, archivist and anarchist fused") borders on a diagnostic label, slightly undermining the otherwise strong interiority of her choice and its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation to reconcile her parents’ opposing legacies is clear and potent. Her interiority is well-rendered through concrete perceptions, like the canvas resembling her mother's hands. The central conflict is compellingly internal, but the character’s self-awareness sometimes feels too articulate, bordering on diagnostic, particularly in the final summary of her own realization.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a core contradictory impulse: she is a “fisher” who hunts with “silence,” a form of active passivity. This defining trait is not just stated but dramatized; her refusal to quicken her pulse is a choice with on-page consequences. The climactic decision to use the rail spike instead of a “cry” is a perfect, earned expression of her established nature, resolving the central conflict by doubling down on her core trait rather than abandoning it. The change in her motivation, from "catch" to "conversation," is a meaningful, earned shift with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb. Cordelia’s motivation is established with poetic efficiency—the "seven hundred thirty orbits" of regret provide a concrete internal stake. Her actions are driven by a powerful internal contradiction: using a relic of the failed past (the nib) to create a redeemed future. The choice to keep the broken nib, noting that “the tool breaks with the falsehood,” provides a perfectly earned and costly resolution to her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply embodied, moving from a desire to silence personal guilt to a more profound act of release. The internal conflict is dramatized through her interaction with the console, particularly in the final choice between self-serving and selfless solutions. The action of inking a "mute star" is a perfect, earned culmination of her character as an artist, resolving her guilt by using her craft not for adornment but for renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira's motivation—"to discover meaning in the mess"—is established immediately and drives every action with convincing weight. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, unique sensory details ("meaning felt like chalk dust on her tongue"), avoiding cliché. The final change is earned through the on-page ritual, culminating in a credible acceptance of impermanence that feels like a profound internal shift, not a simple decision.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Asha’s transformation from “gentle radical” to “Iron Cradle” is compelling and earned, grounded in the potent image of the mother burning a book. The internal conflict is clear and the motivation is strong. The score is capped below 9.0 because the moment of epiphany is slightly undermined by diagnostic language (“constructing empathy's armor”), which reads more as authorial summary than as a character’s raw, embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.6)
    The ghost's motivation evolves beautifully from a simple craving for applause to a profound need for "possibility." This shift is dramatized through his interaction with Lila and is earned. The final transformation is a powerful resolution, and the cost—Lila’s disappearance—gives the ending weight. The character's internal conflict and its resolution are both clear and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya's arc from "affectionate skepticism" to acceptance is compelling and well-motivated by events. Her interiority is concrete and her struggle feels genuine. However, the pivotal shift in motivation is summarized ("Maya realized her motivation wasn't...") rather than fully dramatized, slightly flattening the emotional peak of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aera’s motivation is established immediately and remains the unwavering core of her character. Her choice to press the fossil to her sternum is a powerful, embodied act driven by a deep-seated, almost instinctual need ("an ache older than grammar"), which aligns perfectly with her established role. The transformation she undergoes is profound and earned, moving from archivist to oracle, with the cost felt in her physical collapse and the specific "mass of one fear" being lifted.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established immediately and her transformation from a passive measurer of time to an active re-assembler of futures is fully earned. Her internal state is conveyed through decisive, idiosyncratic actions—like choosing to catalog buttons—rather than declarative labels. The final choice to take two specific buttons provides a concrete, poignant anchor for her conceptual shift, demonstrating a cost and a new purpose with exemplary economy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation to "fix what he had broken" is established early and provides a powerful, consistent engine for the narrative. His internal state—the shift from paralytic prudence to "prudently daring"—is demonstrated through concrete actions like jump-starting the hatch and bandaging his knee. The final earned change is beautifully embodied in the physical sensation of the scar tissue pulling "as if smiling," a perfect fusion of his past damage and future hope.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is masterful for this length. The coachman’s transformation is earned through his quiet, consistent choices to comply with the strange ritual, showing his deep-seated readiness for change. His interiority is conveyed through embodied sensation (“palimpsest promise already tingled beneath his thigh”) rather than abstract summary, and the final cost—the collapse of all his stories into a single syllable—is both profound and physically rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lin's character is consistent and her "zen-minded" nature is demonstrated through her calm, deliberate actions rather than stated. Her motivation is clear and drives the plot. However, she lacks significant internal contradiction acting in-scene; she reads more as a resolved, symbolic figure than a character struggling with a difficult choice, which slightly flattens her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply felt. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, particularly in the "not theft but translation" justification, which reveals a complex inner world. A minor weakness is the direct narrative labeling of her state as "protected vulnerability," which tells the reader what has already been powerfully shown and slightly undermines the otherwise excellent embodiment of her character.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    The quagga’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent: to alchemize the crushing weight of extinction into a sustainable form of self-reliance. Her contradictory impulses—the memory of a human designer versus the instinct of an extinct animal—are embodied in her "four trembling legs" within a library she helped create. The final choice at the henge to split her communal past from her singular future is a profound character act, earned by the story's internal, symbolic logic and paid for with the forfeiture of herd memory.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation to “rejoin the thread” is poetically established and her actions are consistent. The final change feels earned. However, the climactic confession, “I have loved for others until my own heart became a palimpsest,” verges on diagnostic self-awareness, a moment of telling that slightly undermines the embodied struggle that precedes it, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on telling rather than showing. Phrases like "cautiously hopeful demeanor masking the terror" are labels for an internal state, not an embodied experience. Her refusal of the tricksters' offer lacks any sense of temptation or internal conflict, making her feel more like a plot function than a person under immense pressure. The final choice feels inevitable rather than a difficult, earned decision forged in a crucible of contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by the potent internal contradiction of a "claustrophobic explorer." Arin's motivation is clear, and her internal conflict is embodied concretely through her physical reactions to the shrinking space, making her choice to stay a powerful act of will. The backstory of the compass is brief but grounds her actions, and the final choice to accept the bargain is earned through the preceding struggle, with a clear and meaningful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's characterization is exceptional, with her face-blindness serving as a deeply integrated and compelling engine for her unique methodology and motivation. Her interiority is concrete and specific, particularly the insight that her mind "erased faces to keep from overcrowding with grief." The only minor flaw is the slightly over-explicit thematic self-awareness in the line about forgiving her own mind's betrayal, which verges on diagnostic summary in an otherwise masterfully shown internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mara’s motivation is clear, potent, and dramatized through concrete action rather than summary. Her core trait of being “nervously confident” is beautifully rendered in her drumming fingers and trembling hands, which she correctly identifies as the pull of legacy, not fear. The change from a personal quest to a public role is earned and resonant, making her final choice to stay both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.5)
    The fiddler's characterization is exceptional, driven by a deeply-rooted and unique internal conflict between the trauma of her father's fall and the hope offered by the hitchhiker. Her motivation to "sculpt possibility" is not just stated but embodied in the central action of playing the violin. The contradictory impulses—hesitating at the memory of the "snap of tarp," then committing to the "mandate"—are dramatized in the climax, making her final choice to crush the flake and step onto the bridge feel earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exceptionally well-drawn, with a palpable internal conflict between his inherited identity and his failed ambition. The motivation to understand his life’s circular path is clear and compelling, culminating in a change that feels earned, not declared. The contradiction between the “thief’s son face” and the trust it inspired in investors is a potent, specific detail that animates the character.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with the chronicler’s internal conflict—the weight of stories she has absorbed—made concrete and resolved through the story’s central magical event. Her final realization, "I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled," is an earned epiphany that feels inevitable. The secondary character, the boy, provides a powerful external reflection of the protagonist's change when he speaks her name, a simple action charged with immense significance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with poetic precision, rooted in a core internal contradiction between her desire for solitude and her need for absolution. Her final choice to confess is earned through the physical and psychological journey to the vortex's center, making the climactic act of unbending feel inevitable. The character's internal conflict is powerfully embodied in her actions, particularly in the line "she knelt on the root like a penitent soldier laying down arms that still wanted to kill."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's interiority is superb, established with unique, resonant details like having "swallowed a compass." The internal conflict is masterfully embodied in the "kite string pulled by two storms" metaphor, making the protagonist's anxious elation palpable. Their ultimate choice before the Gardener is a perfect crystallization of their established desire for a third way, making the resolution feel deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's internal conflict is made visceral in the choice between two specific, sensory memories, a brilliant dramatization of a hierarchy of values under pressure. Lira's "fiercely gentle" nature is not just a label; it's embodied in her actions and then visibly paid for in her collapse, making her more than a magical guide. The final shift from client to witness is earned and completes a compelling, concise arc for both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict is dramatized with precision, particularly in the private gesture of folding the grille cloth against the impulse to destroy it. The final epiphany—"Applause wasn’t the prize; being needed was"—is an earned, powerful shift that perfectly recontextualizes her motivation and drives the final, decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s character is rendered with exceptional clarity and depth. Her motivation is twofold—professional and deeply personal—and her core trait, a “kindly methodical nature,” creates a believable constraint that she must transcend by embracing the emotional logic of a lullaby. The final shift in understanding is earned through a series of specific, character-driven actions, making her epiphany feel inevitable rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.6)
    The librarian's motivation is both explicit and embodied, creating a character of immense depth despite her non-human nature. Her internal conflict—the tension between mechanical routine and the preservation of organic wonder—is dramatized in the central action. The litany, "I am the echo and the canyon," powerfully resolves the scene's micro-conflict while simultaneously revealing her core contradiction, earning her final acceptance of a mutable identity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s motivation is established with poetic precision and then given a painfully vulnerable, concrete anchor in her own confession. Her internal state is flawlessly embodied through her perception of the environment. The final transformation from inspector to mythic guardian is a profound and earned character change, representing a renunciation of her old life that feels both costly and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's motivation—a guilt-driven, obsessive need for absolution—is established immediately and embodied in his actions, from the methodical mapping to the ritualistic playing of the accordion. The internal conflict is vivid, particularly in the contrast between his scientific chronicling and his trust in "visions." The final change is earned through the difficult, on-page act of confession, making the concluding emotional state of "lighter now" feel entirely credible.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's conceptual framework. The dreamer's motivation is established early and tested through a series of increasingly costly micro-choices (un-saying a lie, trading a memory). The emotion of "cautious exuberance" is perfectly embodied, and the physical manifestation of the library's rules—her own heartbeat arriving late—is a masterful touch of concrete interiority. The final transformation is earned by every preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her personal history (mother's lullaby) and core values (the discordant garden). The internal conflict between two flawed futures is made visceral, and her ultimate choice of a third path is brilliantly triggered by the specific, character-rich vision of her dream being commodified into “Rebellion Lite.” The final action is not just a solution but a profound expression of her identity, earned through the story's specific pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is established with poetic precision, rooted in both professional duty and personal grief. The interiority is rich and specific to her unique profession, avoiding cliché. The final transformation is a powerful, earned culmination of her established values, making the ultimate cost feel both tragic and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The caretaker’s motivation—fleeing grief to find contentment—is immediately complicated by an earned epiphany that true contentment requires returning to the source of pain. Her internal conflict is beautifully embodied in physical reactions, particularly “her knees scallop inward,” which connects her body’s failure to her emotional history. The final choice to descend is a powerful, earned renunciation of her initial goal, demonstrating a complete and credible change with the boy's sacrifice as its visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly the central contradiction that pays Mira's rent: clients needing to project certainty while desperate for their doubt to be witnessed. Mira's shift from professional absorber to active catalyst is earned by the story's atmospheric weight. The phrase "sincerely insincere" perfectly captures the team's internal state, making their eventual break credible and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly in its economy. Elara’s motivation is clear and her state is embodied through concrete details like her changing voice. Marcus's arc from desperate student to inheritor of a profound, costly truth is earned through the story’s single, climactic event. The final action of him picking up the stone provides a tangible sign of his internal shift and acceptance, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cael's motivation is consistently rooted in his reverence and heritage, driving his quest for the "wandering pulse." His interiority is rich with specific, sensory perception (the pulse beating against his ribs, the resonance making his teeth ache), avoiding generic emotional labels. The character's core trait—listening without ears—is well-dramatized, and his final transformation feels earned by the story's internal logic, representing a credible, costly renunciation of his individual, questing self.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elian's motivation is established with superb economy, moving from a well-realized internal state of disillusionment to a decisive, character-altering choice. The internal conflict between his trained resignation and his yearning for authenticity is embodied in the specific action of unstrapping the silver bands. His final transformation into an agent of quiet, hopeful rebellion is earned by this specific on-page risk and feels both profound and credible for this story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jin’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a lifelong sensory quest that drives his every action. The story successfully embodies his internal state through concrete perception, such as the key feeling like a “muted bell.” While his internal drive is strong, the element of internal *conflict*—contradictory impulses acting in-scene—is subtle, presenting more as a serene pursuit than a struggle, which slightly tempers the score in this highly competitive context.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is abstract but consistently dramatized through her methodical actions. The internal conflict between "stellar doubt" and procedural faith is clear, culminating in a powerful, earned choice. However, the reliance on the repeated phrase "quietly enthusiastic" acts as a slight narrative label rather than a fully embodied, contradictory state in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    The reaper's characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear and poignant motivation. The internal conflict is embodied through his actions and perceptions, culminating in a transformation that feels both surprising and inevitable. The specific memory of the girl on the plague cot provides a perfect, concrete anchor for the abstract weight he carries, making his final epiphany deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael's characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction: his magical weakness ("lukewarm") necessitates an alternative, strength-of-character solution ("brittle devotion"). His motivation is clear and his actions are entirely consistent with his earnest, naive nature. The character arc is subtle but profound, moving from a solitary actor to the catalyst for a self-sustaining communal belief, with his life as the clear, earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol’s motivation is clear and compelling, evolving credibly from professional duty to a deeply personal reckoning. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her actions—pocketing the label as "evidence," following the photos, and finally releasing her private grief. The final change to a public curator is earned by the preceding discovery, representing a significant and costly shift in her understanding of her father and herself.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to reconcile "reason and reverence" is established early and provides a powerful, coherent drive. Her internal conflict is not just stated but embodied in her actions—from the logical fallacy of the crystal's existence to the intuitive leap guided by the starlings. The final choice is a perfect culmination of this struggle, earned through prior causality, with the use of her mother's ribbon lending a specific, sentimental weight that makes the abstract conflict deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and tested under pressure, leading to a profound and earned change. Her interiority is rendered through concrete, embodied details, and the final choice to revise her core oath carries a palpable cost, "lighter by one buckle but heavier by one choice." The internal conflict between duty and a necessary new understanding is dramatized with superb economy and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal contradiction in Mara—the ego-dead survivor seeking to feel again—is beautifully rendered, culminating in a choice for empathy over victory. Zero's stoicism cracking to reveal not fear but "only resignation" is a masterful turn, providing the catalyst for the story's compassionate resolution. The final synthesis is an earned change, with the cost of lost individuality explicitly and movingly stated ("grief for the selves lost").

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation to “safeguard space for innovation” is immediately established and then profoundly tested. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied reactions—her pulse matching the storm—and a pivotal choice to guide the labyrinth’s transformation rather than fight it. The final acceptance feels earned, demonstrating a credible character change from a creator in control to a willing co-conspirator with her living creation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ellery’s motivation is intensely clear and his actions are specific, idiosyncratic, and deeply moving. His interiority is embodied through visceral sensations like the silence settling “like dust in his lungs” and his heart “macerating itself.” The characterization is nearly flawless, showing contradictory impulses—desperate grief and methodical hope—acting simultaneously in the ritual with the leaf-blower. A tiny deduction for the slight over-articulation of his epiphany, but it's earned by the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's internal journey from a "cataloguer of certainties" to an embodiment of uncertainty is compelling and psychologically coherent. The motivation is clear and the final transformation feels earned. A minor point of friction is that the character's internal monologue occasionally verges on being too articulate and thesis-like for a being in a feral, liminal state, slightly blurring the line between character thought and authorial theme.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The alchemist's core contradiction—being "stoically sensitive"—is not just a label but is dramatized through his methodical process (pipette, ledger) fused with his ability to hear "frequencies of faith." His final, costly choice to sacrifice his goggles (sight for insight) is a perfectly earned culmination of his stated gospel, "creative destruction," turning the principle inward. This act makes his transformation from a "hopeless alchemist" to a willing prophet deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—her mandate "to find the beginning in every ending"—is brilliantly dramatized, not just stated. Her internal conflict between the technical manuals and her own observation provides a clear, compelling engine for the plot. The choice to discard assumptions is a powerful internal turn with a visible external consequence (the fragment glowing), making her final actions feel earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.4)
    Arden’s motivation is sharp, consistent, and deepens effectively with the brief, poignant memory of his mother’s laughter. His core trait, “resiliently positive,” is not just a label; it’s dramatized in his climactic choice to reject a sacrificial binary and instead merge the timelines, a decision that feels both surprising and inevitable. The final choice is earned by prior causality and has a visible cost, fulfilling the highest standards for characterization at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist serves more as a conduit for the story's high-concept exploration than a character with compelling internal contradictions. Her motivation is clear and consistent, but her "unsettling calm" flattens any potential for embodied struggle or difficult micro-choices under pressure. While the final epiphany is profound, it reads as the logical conclusion of her project rather than a hard-won personal transformation born from flaw or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.4)
    The instructor's characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent internal conflict between grief and purpose. Her motivation is clear and her final choice to give away the chain link is a powerful, earned renunciation with a palpable cost, embodied in the final lines ("a hollow that ached like lungs remembering air"). The interaction with the boy serves as a perfect crucible, crystallizing her shift from preserving the past to investing in the future.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "persistently curious nature" and a desire to "protect vulnerable voices." Her actions align with these traits, and the embodiment of the pulses through sensory details like "penny candy and chlorine" is excellent. The characterization is slightly weakened by the authorial summary of her heroism ("In the incidental heroism of showing up…"), which feels like diagnostic label-speak rather than earned interiority, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict with claustrophobia provides a powerful engine for the narrative. The line “Her claustrophobia screamed, but the gold fleck sang louder” perfectly dramatizes her contradictory impulses in a moment of choice. Her final transformation from managing a phobia to accepting the “wider fear—and obligation—of remembering” is an earned and nuanced character change, showing a shift in her core values driven by the events.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, with a deeply integrated and specific interiority that marries the technological premise with poetic sensibility. The protagonist's motivation to "fetch wisdom" is not just stated but dramatized through the ink ritual, leading to an earned change in perspective. The conflict is primarily internal, and the protagonist’s choices—from the ritual to the final act of solace—are compelling and consistent with his liminal state.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.6)
    The character is a perfect archetype for this mythic tale. Her motivation is primal and clear—"feared silence more"—and her central conflict between this purpose and her fear of the curse is resolved in a powerful, earned act of self-sacrifice. Her contradictory impulses are embodied in her proceeding with the ritual despite her fear, and the final choice to swallow the diamond is the logical and emotionally resonant culmination of her journey. The characterization is flawless within its chosen mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vale’s motivation is clear and her transformation is the story's core, but the pivotal decision to accept metamorphosis feels somewhat frictionless. The internal struggle leading to her immediate acceptance ("allowed the arrowhead to guide her") is more asserted than dramatized in-scene, making the turn feel slightly too swift for a character defined by bitterness.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.4)
    Calla's motivation is established immediately and her micro-choices under pressure—especially the decision to play the lullaby backward—are driven by a clear internal logic that is both intuitive and competent. The brief moment of interiority describing her "gap between knowing... and understanding" provides a perfect, subtle contradiction that fuels the story's tension without over-explanation. Her actions and perceptions are seamlessly integrated, earning the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with poetic precision and immediately dramatized through on-page choices. The internal conflict between appearing harmless and being rebellious is palpable and consistent. The character's specific, lived-in grievance, echoed in the secondary character Sal, gives the high-concept plot a powerful emotional anchor, culminating in a choice that feels both inevitable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The carpenter’s motivation is consistently rooted in his defining trait: a silent man seeking to understand silence. His interiority is conveyed through rich, character-particular perception rather than stock phrasing. The final choice to "sing" with memory is a profound character turn, earned by a lifetime of quiet persistence. A slight deduction is for the abstract nature of his initial drive, which feels more like a thematic premise than a deeply embodied, contradictory need until the climax crystallizes it.

    Calla’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to find “the place where stories live” is established as a long-held, deeply personal quest, rooted in a specific past event. The final choice to sacrifice the scarf is a perfect culmination of this journey, representing the release of her accumulated past and duty, which earns her a new state of contented guardianship. The shift from a seeker defined by reputation to one defined by "verified coordinates" is a subtle, powerful change with a clear and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireya's motivation is exceptionally clear, fierce, and rooted in the fantastical premise. Her interiority is conveyed through potent, specific images ("hollowed by absence") rather than abstract labels. The final change is earned and resonant, as she becomes a living part of the solution; the cost of this transformation is made tangible when the palette cracks and the colors rush into her. While the characterization is superb, it just misses a perfect score as the central conflict is presented as a singular, unwavering quest rather than a dramatized clash of contradictory impulses in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archetypal characterization is effective and suits the mythic tone, with a strong and consistent motivational throughline. The locksmith’s surprise at the end provides a welcome touch of humanity. However, the lack of palpable internal contradiction or struggle in the present moment keeps it just shy of the highest tier, as he reads more as a perfect instrument of his function than a person wrestling with a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her defining trait, curiosity, directly drives the climactic choice. The internal conflict between the safety of forgetting and the desire for wholeness is dramatized effectively. The final choice to reclaim her past is earned by her established character as a "hands-on folklorist" and feels inevitable in hindsight, with the cost of confronting pain made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira’s characterization is superb, driven by a core contradiction of “combative tenderness” that is embodied in every action, from spitting in the dust to her blade-like smile. Her motivation is clear and consistent, and her final choice to accept the burden of memory for the child feels earned and powerful. The internal conflict is dramatized with concrete actions rather than summarized, fulfilling the highest standards for interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arin’s motivation is pristine and his final transformation from hoarder to distributor of wonder is earned through the story's central turn. The flaw of his initial misunderstanding drives the plot effectively. While his interiority is lyrically rendered, he functions more as a perfect archetype for the story's mythic tone, lacking the sharp, contradictory internal frictions that would elevate him into a more complex, psychologically dense character.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mirel's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is established immediately and embodied in the physical weight of the "interlaced hush." The internal conflict between her duty as a restorer and her dawning realization is dramatized through her actions, culminating in a choice that is both surprising and inevitable. The final renunciation of her vocation is earned by the accumulated empathy from the unraveling knots, creating a powerful and costly character change.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation as "methodically curious" is expertly dramatized through her actions, from salvaging equipment to comparing film strips. The final change to a worldview of "shielded openness" is earned by her choice to wait and listen. Her interiority is strong, particularly the "cold hand around her ribs," but her final epiphany feels slightly more like a thematic summary than a raw, embodied emotional shift, holding it just shy of a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, potent, and drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity, embodying her "quietly analytic" nature through her actions and perceptions rather than labels. The one minor flaw is the final recorded note, which veers into diagnostic self-awareness ("Hypothesis confirmed..."), slightly flattening the complex emotional progression just achieved. Fred is a masterful companion character, applying pressure through quiet observation and a single, perfectly placed quote.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative compellingly. The internal conflict is skillfully externalized through the echo, leading to an earned character change. The echo's line, "You're encoding us away," is slightly too direct, momentarily replacing subtext with a bald statement of theme, which is the only minor friction in an otherwise stellar characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional. Her driving trait—"an inconvenient curiosity"—is established early and pays off in every choice she makes. The arc from servant to guardian is earned and deeply resonant, culminating in a decisive renunciation of her old life. The micro-scenes with the duke's son and the stoker powerfully dramatize her transformation, showing her already acting as a conduit for the captain’s discovered joy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in generational legacy and a fierce, quiet resolve. Her interiority is rendered through concrete, physical interactions, such as her fingers finding the specific dent on the telescope, which powerfully anchors backstory to present action. The final choice to memorialize her mother’s name and step into the void is a perfectly earned culmination of her character, fulfilling her “quietly explosive” nature with the ultimate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's core concept. The artist's interiority is rendered with concrete, specific detail tied to her prosopagnosia, making her limitation a powerful and unique perceptual lens. The internal conflict between her perceived failure and her actual gift is dramatized effectively, culminating in an earned epiphany. The final choice feels inevitable, rooted in the preceding causal chain of discovery and self-realization, with the cost of losing her sanctuary making the change meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives the plot from the opening sentence. The internal conflict of “sociable isolation” is skillfully rendered, paying off in the final beat as it lifts. The character's core trait, her diligent curiosity, is demonstrated through action—tracing non-existent coastlines, investigating the cargo deck—rather than simply stated, making her climactic discovery feel earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Rowan's motivation—to heal his own arrhythmic heart by understanding cosmic repair—is clear, poignant, and drives every action. His interiority is conveyed through beautifully specific, embodied language ("doubt hissed like thawing steel") rather than abstract labels. The final earned change from grieving apprentice to custodian is compelling, and his central flaw (being tied to a past mistake) is directly addressed by the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her altruism is demonstrated through concrete actions rather than labels. The shift in the community's trust, seen through Kai, is well-earned. However, moments of interiority sometimes read as authorial summary ("her altruism had found its own heartbeat in theirs") rather than a character's embodied experience, creating a slight emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The adjuster's motivation is established with professional stakes and then masterfully deepened into a personal, historical imperative by the puppet head. The final choice to accept eternal stasis is a powerful renunciation earned by the story's internal logic, with the cost made tangible in the line "Acceptance tasted of iron and lullabies." Her internal conflict is shown, not told, culminating in a choice that is both tragic and transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction: her hatred for her prison is matched only by her commitment to the "graceless beauty" of her duty. This conflict is not merely stated but embodied in her every action, from the mechanical recitation of the map to the final, sacrificial use of the nut. The motivation is deeply rooted in personal history (the mother's last gift), making her endurance a poignant and earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mara’s motivation stems from a specific, potent blend of professional identity, personal grief, and guilt over a missed call, compelling her to "atone." Her internal conflict is embodied, not stated, particularly in the shift from observing the empty chrysalis to seeing it as a mold—a choice driven by her core traits. The final act of leaving is a perfectly earned renunciation, showing a credible change with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vendor's motivation is consistently enacted but remains highly conceptual, and her final turn feels more like a thematic necessity than an earned emotional shift. The epiphany, "realized she had been the protagonist all along," is stated directly, which slightly undermines the moment by leaning on diagnostic self-awareness rather than an embodied, contradictory impulse shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marisol's motivation is exceptionally clear and undergoes a profound, earned transformation. Her interiority is rendered through a unique sensory palette, and the final choice to give rather than take memories feels like an inevitable culmination of her discovery. The character arc is compelling, moving from a desire to erase pain to a wiser impulse to integrate it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mireya's motivation is clear and her competence is her defining characteristic, which fits the story's fable-like structure. While her internal conflict is less about contradictory impulses and more about executing a difficult task, her "empathetically decisive" nature is demonstrated through action rather than just stated. The exhaustion she feels at the end provides a tangible, albeit small, cost for her efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is intensely specific and dramatized from the opening. Her defining trait, “chaotically precise,” is not just a label but is embodied in the central action of calibrating the helmet (“with the care of a watchmaker having seizures”). Her transformation at the end—a failure that yields partial success and renewed determination—is earned through the visceral climax, making her final choice to continue a credible and compelling evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.4)
    Ilyra’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in decades of intellectual obsession that becomes a personal, existential crisis. Her interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity through the "prism-minded" concept, which is not just a label but a demonstrated mode of perception. The final choice to become a "combination" is a profound and earned transformation, showing a character whose core traits lead her to a logical, if extraordinary, conclusion with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.4)
    Ilay’s motivation is fierce and her method is unique, making her a compelling, active character. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through the "symphonically minded" perception that filters the entire world. The one slightly explicit line, “Empathy in motion—that is her craft,” is immediately embodied by her actions, making it feel more like a concise thesis for her work rather than a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a well-defined philosophy. The internal conflict between despair and the search for meaning is well-realized, and the final shift to purposeful action feels earned. The characterization is slightly weakened by an over-articulation of his own emotional/intellectual state, which at times reads more like a summary of his arc than an embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mirelle’s character is exceptionally well-drawn, with a consistent and compelling motivation rooted in her pacifist philosophy. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, unique details, and her final choice to sing back is a perfect culmination of her beliefs. The only minor weakness is the final paragraph's slight pivot to summary ("She would spend the rest of her nights teaching others..."), which somewhat over-articulates her transformation into a tidy mission statement rather than letting it resonate purely through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.4)
    Myrrh’s motivation is clear and complex, blending ambition with a deeper yearning for wisdom. Her internal conflict is beautifully dramatized, shifting from a desire “to astonish the village” to a state of gratitude. The final change feels earned and is embodied in the quiet act of leaving her journal, a perfect renunciation of the ego that drove her initial ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Aera's motivation is clear and her arc is compelling, culminating in a choice with a visible, on-page cost—the offering of her memories. Her interiority is concrete and her competence as a pilot is well-established through action. The final choice feels earned by the preceding journey, demonstrating a meaningful change in her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The investigator's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. Interiority relies on professional labels ("cultivating foresight in action") rather than embodied emotion or internal contradiction. While competent, she functions more as a lens to view the phenomenon than as a character experiencing a deep internal arc, making the final burden of knowledge feel more conceptual than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is vivid and consistent, anchored by the concrete interiority of the protagonist's synesthesia. Her motivation is mythically clear and her actions are purposeful. However, she functions more as a perfect conduit for the ritual than a character with internal contradictions; the absence of any dramatized doubt or flaw, while fitting for a fable, limits the characterological depth required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear and compelling motivation that is tested and transformed. Kaelen’s internal conflict between being “driven” and the need for “stillness” is dramatized through a potent central action (breathing silence instead of playing music). The final renunciation is earned and carries a visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Quince’s internal conflict between intellectual quantification and embodied feeling is rendered with superb clarity. His defining trait—borrowing personalities—creates an immediate and escalating internal contradiction. The final choice is a powerful renunciation earned by the preceding turmoil, and his resulting state (“blank as unprinted paper, perfectly weightless and suddenly terrifying”) is a costly and credible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional. The core internal conflict—his "jittery waltz—half terror, half anticipation"—is embodied and sustained perfectly until it transforms into trembling "with the weight of becoming." The motivation is clear, and the final shift is earned within the story's mythic logic, fulfilling the narrative arc from a courier navigating wonder alone to becoming wonder itself.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elian’s characterization is exceptional. His motivation is clear, and the internal conflict between letting go and needing his sister is powerfully dramatized through the “truthful lies” ritual. The progression from a performative lie to a vulnerable truth is earned and emotionally resonant, culminating in a credible change in his internal state without resorting to a simplistic cure for his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is established through potent, embodied action rather than exposition. The spinner's motivation is revealed late but feels earned by the story's wistful atmosphere, culminating in a climactic choice that is both shocking and inevitable. Her final state of silent, stoic endurance is a powerful and credible transformation, fulfilling the core requirements for a change earned with a visible, deeply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional for this length. The central contradiction—a meek blacksmith who intimately understands weight and how to unmake it—provides a powerful engine for his transformation. The arc from meekness to defiance is earned through a series of escalating choices, culminating in his refusal to bargain for partial freedom. The final choice feels inevitable and true to the character forged in the smelter.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and deepens from a general professional itch to a high-stakes personal quest. Interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion ("pulse, loud as launch drums"), avoiding abstraction. The final change—to chart consequences instead of places—is a powerful and earned renunciation of her past self, with the cost felt in the weight of her newfound complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The characterization of Elias is deep and specific, with his motivations shown through resonant, character-particular actions like building the cairn of apologies. His internal conflict—fear for the keeper versus faith in their ritual—is palpable and drives the narrative. The final action is slightly undermined by a continuity issue with the sea glass, which prevents a perfect score, but the core of the character remains compellingly drawn.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s characterization is strong, progressing from a performer of an ancient routine to an agent of cosmic change. Her motivation shifts compellingly from duty to an accepted geas, a turn handled well, though the line “Lirael understood then that her motivation…” verges on diagnostic summary. The embodiment of her final choice through “shadowed elation” is excellent, showing a complex internal state where joy and cost are inextricable, fulfilling the contradictory impulse requirement for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear, consistent, and effectively drives the plot from start to finish. His internal arc from seeker to custodian is earned through on-page action. The only minor weakness is that the final epiphany, while emotionally resonant, is articulated in a slightly too-diagnostic summary ("Kael understood then why..."), which slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise beautifully embodied emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a powerful internal contradiction. Her initial methodical approach, creating a "Sorrow Index," compellingly collides with her final, intuitive understanding to "quantify nothing." This shift is not merely stated but earned through the central action, making her transformation from a maintenance worker to a holistic healer feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by a potent central contradiction: a keeper of memory who has lost her own. Her motivation is clear and compelling, and her climactic choice to slam the fractured mica into her chest is a powerful, embodied act of desperation that feels earned. The final renunciation of her name, choosing to let it be sung rather than spoken, provides a resonant and character-particular closure, transforming her from a scattered individual into a communal symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, stemming from a specific, costly mistake. Her internal conflict—the paradox of "staying while leaving"—is not just stated but embodied in her actions. The final transformation is a compelling culmination of her compassionate, guilt-ridden nature, though its execution relies on the story's magical logic more than a final, character-driven choice. The score is capped due to a prose artifact in the story's final third.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mila’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation rooted in her unique profession that drives the entire narrative. Her transformation from a passive “noticer” to an active “cultivator” is earned and embodied in the final image of her having “soil under nails now hers.” The internal conflict between preserving the bread as evidence and using it as a tool is subtle but effective, leading to a final stance of perpetual, gentle resistance that feels both costly and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb. The chief’s motivation is established with elegant economy, and her internal conflict between meticulous duty and dawning futility is embodied in her actions. The turn, prompted by her own story being archived, is earned and powerful, leading to a final choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The mentor’s wisdom provides a perfect thematic anchor for this change, demonstrating a complex hierarchy of values resolved with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is complex and deeply felt, rooted in a desire for a painful certainty. The internal conflict is beautifully dramatized, especially in the line, "I realized I wanted him to stop me, to care enough to stop me," which reveals the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-stakes moment. The emotional arc from hope to a liberated emptiness is earned and rendered with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s arc from “luminous skeptic” to a person who understands and accepts a new purpose is clear, motivated, and earned. Her internal conflict is resolved with a credible transformation shown through the pivotal line, "I was." The secondary characters are archetypal but function effectively as catalysts within this mythic, lyrical frame, focusing pressure on Mira’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict is embodied through action, particularly the climactic drawing scene. The transformation feels earned and costly. The characterization is slightly weakened by a moment of overly diagnostic interiority ("forgiveness is just memory learning to breathe underwater"), which reads more like a thematic thesis statement than an in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is deeply rooted in her core trait of “wilting near dishonesty,” providing a compelling and consistent engine for the narrative. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific language, such as feeling herself “folding inward.” The climactic choice to admit her fear—“Because I’m afraid I’ve forgotten how to listen to anything that isn’t echo”—is a perfectly earned moment of vulnerability that directly impacts the plot, demonstrating a seamless fusion of internal conflict and external action.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tuner's motivation—to preserve a forgotten wonder—is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is revealed through precise, embodied choices rather than summary; her skill is shown in how her "fingertips reading micro-oscillations." The final choice to pass the wedge to the boy provides an earned, resonant closure to her arc, demonstrating her shift from preservation to propagation without a single word. The characterization is powerful and specific, achieving the 9+ quick test for an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    K-17's internal conflict between its caretaker protocols and the emergent "longing" from the box is compelling and well-realized. The arc from programmed servitor to a being of "fragmented wholeness" is earned through its interaction with the story's central object. The final choice to plant itself is a powerful culmination of this internal journey, demonstrating a meaningful change with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's motivation is established immediately and her actions follow from it with clear internal consistency. The shift from an investigative approach (borescope) to a receptive one (sitting in silence) represents a potent internal conflict between wanting to solve and needing to witness. This turn is earned by the failure of the first method, making her final state of "calm" credible and foreclosing the path of forced entry with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation as the “last of her kind” is established and sustained with mythic competence. Her interiority is beautifully embodied through action, particularly in the line "her ankles wrote cursive warnings as she glided," which externalizes her internal state and skill set perfectly. The characterization is archetypal rather than deeply conflicted, which fits the lyrical mode, but a moment of genuine struggle or doubt could have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mael's motivation is established with poetic precision and held with unwavering focus. The character’s internal conflict is masterfully embodied through her interaction with the surreal environment, particularly her choice to feed the memory-projection her matchbook—a micro-choice that demonstrates a hierarchy of values with a tangible cost. Her final state of being "heavier with recollection yet body lighter" is a perfectly earned and paradoxical resolution, showcasing a profound and credible internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystal clear and the summoner's internal state is beautifully embodied through his ritualistic actions. The earned stasis of the ending, where he carries the conflict within him, is a powerful and credible resolution for the character. His transformation is subtle but profound, culminating in the "quiet flag" of his smile.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation undergoes a compelling, earned transformation from seeking companionship to accepting a new, solitary identity. The shift is concretized in the final beats with Mrs. Chen, demonstrating the character’s acceptance of her new role. The central internal conflict—loneliness versus purpose—is resolved with a poignant and complex new stasis, a choice made with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is powerful and her internal conflict as the “charmed skeptic” is compelling. The character arc is earned through a tangible, on-page cost. A minor deduction is for the slightly too-articulate self-analysis (“she admitted she wanted to translate isolation into independence”), which verges on diagnostic summary rather than purely embodied interiority at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and powerful, rooted in grief and vengeance that has curdled into self-imprisonment. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through her interactions with the symbolic objects. Her final choice to write in her own hand is an earned, meaningful change. However, the character's interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language (e.g., "wisely enduring the weight of calibrated treason"), which slightly distances the reader from the raw emotion of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her internal state is vividly rendered through her unique perceptual abilities. The story stumbles slightly on the identity of the old woman; the line "My daughter learned to listen" is ambiguous when juxtaposed with Lira recognizing her own features, creating a moment of confusion at a crucial point. A final choice earned with palpable cost elevates the characterization, but this lack of clarity prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.6)
    Marrow's characterization is superb, established through a distinct professional identity and a core internal value ("weaves truth carefully"). Her arc is subtle but potent, culminating in "the first unguarded expression" she has allowed herself, a change earned through the story's events. The motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—pressing her hands to the ice, speaking to the glacier—are concrete embodiments of her unique capabilities and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is superb, realized through a fusion of philosophical interiority and concrete, craft-based action. Her motivation—to appreciate hidden effort—is established early and tested in the final, decisive choice. The concept of "demure audacity" perfectly captures her internal contradiction, making her final leap of faith onto a "staircase made of absence" both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marisol’s motivation is established with compelling backstory and immediately tested. The internal conflict lands powerfully when the diamond forces her to confront her own complicity, making her subsequent choice to broadcast the truth—rather than hide or destroy it—a perfectly earned and character-defining act. The line "excavate truth from comfortable lies, even if the shovel cut her own hands" is expertly dramatized by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deepens from preservation to creation, a shift earned through the story’s events. Her internal conflict is shown, not told, culminating in the laughter of "gritty whimsy" which perfectly embodies her character. The transformation from "lonely" to "alone in the way of someone who has" is a powerful, earned change that resonates beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently dramatized through her actions. The internal conflict between preservation and translation is expertly brought to a head by the child's request, forcing an earned, costly choice. Her character is revealed entirely through her relationship with her tools and her environment, a masterful execution of showing over telling. The final choice feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mireya’s motivation is immediately clear and deeply felt. Her defining trait, "logically emotional," is not merely stated but dramatized in the pivotal "calculus" that forces her to find a third path. Her competence as an engineer is seamlessly blended with her role as a mystical guardian, and the final image of her tears tasting of "salt, iron, and whale song" provides a powerful, embodied closure that feels earned by the prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elian’s characterization is exceptional. The central conflict between his professional vigilance and personal impatience is established immediately and resolved with profound resonance in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is exceptional, blending professional competence with deep-seated vulnerability. Her motivation is clear and intensifies perfectly, moving from a procedural investigation to a personal reckoning. The internal conflict is masterfully embodied in physical actions, such as gripping the warm lantern to ground herself against a traumatic memory, which feels specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Emil’s motivation is complex and deeply felt, evolving from passive prayer to decisive, risky action. His internal conflict is powerfully dramatized, and the final shift is earned through the scene's pressure. Olya serves as an effective foil and catalyst, her pragmatism sharpening the chaplain's moral crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Juniper's interiority is conveyed with specificity through the contradictory but coherent stance of "irreverent awe." Her motivation is esoteric yet unwavering, and her defining trait, "steadily curious," is demonstrated through action rather than stated. The final image of her grin—"both mocking and beatific"—perfectly captures an earned, complex state that feels both individual and universal to the act of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from professional duty to a deeply personal quest rooted in her mother's history.

    Kael's motivation is consistent and compelling, rooted in his backstory and relationship with Sira. However, the line "Kael’s motivation crystallized: to map empathy onto action..." is an instance of diagnostic label-speak at a peak moment of choice, abstracting the decision rather than letting it be fully embodied. This prevents the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling and concrete internal contradiction: the desire to witness endings versus the emergent need to serve them. Her transformation is earned through the crucible of her interaction with the boy, culminating in the costly, credible choice to give away her heirloom. The motivation shifts from passive observation to active solace, with the "fold in patience" serving as a perfect objective correlative for her inner state.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his internal journey is well-defined, but his epiphany is articulated using "diagnostic label-speak." Phrases like "nurturing intersubjective understanding" feel more like an academic summary than a vineyard sentinel's lived insight, slightly cheapening the emotional authenticity of his final, earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line walker's motivation is sharp and well-grounded by the physical detail of the scar, which effectively externalizes the stakes of a past failure. However, his interiority, while consistent with the story's mythic tone, remains highly conceptual ("a distortion in his understanding," "raw substance of understanding"). The characterization is strong and purposeful but lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied emotional texture that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her whimsical but earnest belief in transmutation. Her actions—the slow, deliberate arrangement, the whispering to the factory—are perfectly aligned with this internal state. The character is beautifully rendered, though the internal conflict remains more philosophical than visceral, lacking a moment of sharp, contradictory impulse that would elevate it into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, her motivation to "decode the pattern" evolving into a need to "witness." The internal conflict between her scholarly past—a belief in catalogued facts—and the living, unclassifiable memories she encounters is the story's engine. The final change, from reticent observer to the first participant in a new form of language, is earned and carries the felt cost of leaving a world of certainty behind.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prophet’s motivation is singular, clear, and powerfully rooted in his unique condition. His interiority is expressed through concrete, resonant actions—arranging driftwood, marking surfaces with chalk—rather than abstract summary. The final earned shift from searching for a sound to embodying a process is a meaningful character change, a credible renunciation of a fixed goal for an acceptance of his state, which lands with the cost of continued impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mira’s characterization is exceptional, defined by the central, embodied conflict between her role as a constant repairer and the need to embrace the ephemeral. Her shift is earned, culminating in a choice—to photograph rather than fix—that is both a logical and emotional fulfillment of her arc. The mentor's advice, revealed in the final photograph, lands as an earned insight rather than an expositional crutch, perfectly crystallizing her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in her past, compelling her actions in the present. Her interiority is concrete, especially her connection to the record. The final realization feels earned, but its articulation—"she understood: reunify does not mean repair..."—verges on diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, slightly flattening the embodied emotion of the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyra's motivation as a scholar seeking to "relearn" is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her deliberate nature is well-demonstrated through her methodical approach to the cosmic puzzle. However, her interiority remains somewhat intellectual; the story conveys her understanding of the stakes and the solution, but the emotional cost of her sacrifice—trading her "wandering silhouette"—is stated more than it is viscerally embodied, which slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored in the potent internal contradiction of a "forgiving skeptic" whose foundational beliefs have been shattered. Her motivation is clarified in a moment of crisis, and her transformation from yearning for past certainty to embracing "bright fractures" is earned through a concrete, on-page choice. The change is profound, and its cost—the loss of her simple, binary worldview—is made palpable in the story's final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, rooted effectively in memory and her role as a "star watcher." The interiority is specific and embodied, particularly the moment she feels the "exact mass of every night she had spent alone," which gives the abstract stakes a physical weight. While powerful, the characterization remains tightly focused on her quest, with a slight tendency toward archetypal purity over more complex, contradictory impulses acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with Mira’s motivation established in potent, concrete terms: “the wound inside her had begun to taste like metal.” Her interiority is consistently filtered through the story’s central metaphors of nature and decay. The character’s actions are earned, culminating in a final choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. A minor deduction is for a line of interiority—"the dignity of choosing what grows inside you"—that verges on being too self-aware and thematically articulate, momentarily stepping out of embodied emotion into diagnostic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional. Mara’s motivation is clear, complex, and intensifies from a practical need (money) to a profound artistic crisis. Her internal conflict is dramatized beautifully through the externalized cameos, especially the confrontation with Lira, which perfectly links the protagonist of the novel-within-the-story to the protagonist of the story itself. The choice at the climax—to renounce the collected fragments for courage—is a powerful and earned reversal, demonstrating a deep change with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is powerful and clear, rooted in the personal stakes of her daughter's illness. Her competence and focus are well-established, but the characterization lacks a compelling internal conflict; she executes a difficult task perfectly without a moment of doubt, hesitation, or a choice between two competing values. The "voice cracking at first" is a good moment of embodied emotion, but the overall portrayal is of a flawless practitioner rather than a struggling individual, which limits the depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The alchemist's motivation is profound, rooted in a well-integrated backstory that gives her current quest immense weight. Her interiority is rendered through specific, embodied metaphors ("each thump of her pulse...was a village waiting to be founded"), making her final act of relinquishment feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ansel's characterization is strong and consistent, with his locksmith's methodical nature providing a compelling anchor for the fantastical events. The integration of memory through the reflective surfaces is masterful. The only minor weakness is the whispered line, "I will store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later," which feels slightly too much like a direct thematic statement, briefly thinning the veil of character to reveal the author's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The weaver’s motivation is immediately clear and consistent, but her crucial internal conflict—the un-grieved burden—is held back until the climax, where it is powerfully revealed. The final choice to confess is not just an emotional epiphany but a necessary tactical decision driven by the external threat of the sputtering lamp, earning the transformation. Her contradictory impulses (the duty to weave vs. the instinct to protect her secret) act simultaneously in the final beats, fulfilling the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. Mara’s motivation is rooted in a specific, tangible grief, and her every action—from tracing the wood grain to the final choice of what to carve next—is a direct expression of her internal state. The story masterfully depicts contradictory impulses, showing her need to "contain" the memory while acknowledging that "cages were made to open," a conflict that resolves into the sophisticated understanding that memory can be "both cage and key." Her interiority is rendered with concrete, profession-specific details ("thumb calloused from years of gripping safety ropes") that make her struggle feel singular and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation—to negotiate with a ghost that is a part of himself—is clear and compelling. The internal conflict between his scavenger's identity and his desire for wholeness is rendered through concrete choices with felt costs, particularly the hesitation before surrendering 2015. The final transformation is a perfectly earned consequence of his choices, showing a character who barters away his substance piece by piece until none is left.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is rendered with a specific, compelling voice. Her engineer's perspective, viewing hope as a system to be plumbed, is well-realized. The characterization is slightly held back by a lack of tangible internal conflict; she is almost purely competent, with her "smile without happiness" being the main hint of a more complex emotional cost. This efficiency serves the story's conceptual focus but keeps the character at a slight remove.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and deeply felt. The transformation from carrying the “weight of arrogance like a cracked gear” to achieving the “slower currency of acceptance” is earned through her on-page ritual. The character's internal conflict is resolved with a tangible cost—the renunciation of her original dream—making her final peace credible and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s motivation is singular and powerfully dramatized, progressing from a general quest for clarity to a specific, costly purpose. Her internal state of “serene upheaval” is a brilliant, embodied contradiction that anchors the story’s tone and her transformation. The final choice is earned through a crucible of discovery, and the change from carrying her father's legend to carrying her own purpose is profound and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.4)
    Ari's characterization is exceptional, defined by a core trait ("infinitely patient") that is demonstrated through action rather than merely stated. Her motivation is clear, potent, and drives the narrative from the first paragraph to the last. The contrast between her embodied, quiet knowledge and the harbormaster's recited, bureaucratic authority is sharp and effective, revealing her values under pressure without expository interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is compelling and her internal journey is rendered with concrete, character-particular interiority. The shift from seeking a physical place of healing to understanding it as an internal process is earned. The final realization that she was her own first client is a powerful turn that recasts her entire seven-year journey as a necessary act of self-creation, fulfilling the arc with a visible cost (a life lived in absence).

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prince’s motivation is established with visceral clarity and his interiority is rendered through specific, unique actions rather than summary. The final acceptance of the fall is an earned change, a believable evolution from passive melancholy to active embrace of a new, uncertain genesis. The character arc perfectly serves the story's core thematic inquiry, demonstrating a flawless fusion of motive and action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal contradiction of being a firefighter and an arsonist's daughter. Her motivation—"to prove that scars can sing"—is not just stated but embodied in every specific, ritualistic action. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively, particularly when the old anger rises and she consciously "breathed it down," showing a layered, non-binary emotional state that makes her final, earned shift in stance credible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist's arc from a detached "skeptic" seeking "liberation" to a vulnerable "daughter" acknowledging her own complicity is compelling and earned. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her interactions with the box, culminating in a resonant, character-driven change. The motivation is clear, intensifies under pressure, and the final choice feels both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between inherited duty (rooted sorrow) and personal hope (transmission) is beautifully embodied in his actions with the gear. The final choice feels earned, directly resolving the central contradiction of his character. The emotional progression from sentimental melancholy to active purpose is entirely credible and lands with satisfying weight.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's characterization is superb, established through action rather than exposition. Her choice to bring a ribbon instead of steel instantly defines her approach to her craft and to the dead. Her motivation is clear and her internal state is beautifully embodied in the "fiercely meditative" actions that form the story's core, earning the final, quiet acceptance of her own name in the cycle of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is nearly flawless, driven by a powerful internal conflict between ingrained duty and the need for familial absolution. The motivation is clear and deepens throughout, culminating in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The protagonist's contradictory impulses—to maintain the precise mechanism versus shattering its purpose—are embodied in the single, climactic act of replacing the pendulum bob.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mercy's characterization is strong, with a clear motivation and embodied emotional progression. The shift from "blithe gardener" to "keeper" is earned through her methodical actions. The final paragraph's direct statement of her new role ("Mercy understands she is no longer...") feels slightly over-articulated, momentarily replacing embodied realization with a diagnostic label, which keeps this from the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cartographer's motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves from a task ("seed innovation") into a profound personal philosophy ("surrendering to it"). Her internal state is masterfully externalized through embodied costs—the frostbite, the absorbed reflection, the loss of specific memories—making her final, total sacrifice feel earned and inevitable rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mila’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are a direct, believable extension of her craft as a copyist. Her character is revealed through meticulous, goal-oriented action rather than deep internal contradiction, which fits the story’s fable-like quality. The final choice to remain and copy the airborne score is a potent crystallization of her identity, showing a shift from preservation to active creation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elena's motivation is deeply rooted and powerfully dramatized through her handling of the story's core objects. The contradiction between seeing the chair as "an art installation" and a sacred relic ("funeral procession of one") provides a potent internal conflict. Her final actions are earned, representing a credible and costly integration of her grief into a new identity, fulfilling the story's arc without simplistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Caldera's characterization is compelling and consistent. Her motivation—a philosophical imperative for truth—is established clearly and drives every action. The internal conflict between her isolation and her mission is palpable, and her "rationally rebellious" nature is demonstrated through her methodical actions rather than just stated. The choice to finally speak is an earned change, representing a shift from internal struggle to external confrontation, with the cost of that transition felt in the crowd's recoil.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority perfectly aligned. The transition from a once-harmonious teacher to a silent vessel of change is earned through a credible internal struggle against her own rage. The final sacrifice of her singing voice provides a powerful, character-defining cost that feels both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marisol's character is exceptional, with motivation and interiority fused through sensory, profession-specific details. Her wisdom is demonstrated through action, not just declared, particularly in her interpretation of the greenhouse's past via taste. The act of feeding the sprout her own blood provides a moment of visceral commitment, grounding her rebellion in personal cost and making her final success feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and established early through her actions and internal thought (“recalibrated the manual turnstile just to hear its brass heart beat”). The core internal conflict is potent: her defining trait of truthfulness is precisely what she must sacrifice to achieve her goal of preserving wonder. The final choice feels earned and costly, representing a significant character change from a passive keeper to an active enabler of magic.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireille’s motivation is consistently dramatized, moving from a specialized observer to an active participant. Her internal state is conveyed through superb sensory detail, and her ultimate choice to engage with the house is earned by the story's internal logic. The final paragraph lands a compelling cost, expanding her unique sensitivity from a gift into a potential burden, fulfilling the 9+ quick test of a choice with visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, achieving a profound internal arc for a non-human entity. The central conflict between the statue's ingrained purpose as a "sentinel" and its newly awakened capacity for empathy is rendered with precision. The line, "I answered with the only honesty I owned: 'I am learning,'" is a masterful, concise expression of this transformation. The final shift from stone skin to "possibility" is earned through the story's carefully constructed internal debate and decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and deepens from a vague search for a “missed something” to a precise understanding of its “texture.” Her background as a mathematician is not just a label; it informs her actions and worldview, from counting prime-numbered steps to using a sigma symbol. The final choice to renounce the opportunity for its texture is a powerful, earned change, demonstrating a complex internal contradiction where acceptance of loss becomes the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mira’s motivation is clear, embodied, and deeply felt without being overstated; her insomnia is a "lantern," not just a trait. The brief reflection on her mother is expertly cued by Jules's arrival, anchoring the theme in a specific past without losing momentum. Jules serves as a perfect secondary character, providing pressure through witness and confirming the mural's power without a single word of dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aurelia’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her grandmother's teaching that "memory lives in the hands." Her internal conflict between passive preservation and active rescue is dramatized effectively, culminating in a decisive choice. The contradictory impulses—her historical orientation versus the need for present action—are resolved when she transforms an artifact (lens) into a tool for revival, earning her final stance with visible cost (the smaller, changed community).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to escape a fated death is clear and compelling, and his specific skillset as a counter-clockwise clock maker is brilliantly integrated into the plot. His internal state is conveyed through the powerful recurring motif of "bleak exhilaration," which captures a complex, contradictory emotional reality without resorting to cliché. The final change—sacrificing his unique gift for possibility—is a profound choice that is earned by the preceding struggle and made tangible by the cracked hunger stone.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation to confront trauma is embodied and visceral, not stated. The internal conflict is masterfully externalized through the "whispering advisor," and the final choice to give the clasp to the child-fear demonstrates a profound, earned change with a clear, felt cost—the relinquishing of a protective talisman and an internal voice. The character's transformation from haunted to unfrightened is entirely convincing within the story's psychological framework.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prophet’s motivation is crystalline and his actions are consistent, making him a powerful functional center for the narrative. However, he reads as a near-perfect archetype of the artist-savior, lacking the internal contradictions or flaws that would elevate him into a more complex character. His competence is absolute and his success, while earned through his unique worldview, never seems truly in doubt from his perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, wedding a professional duty (charting a safe path for Chelon) to a deep-seated personal obsession (understanding the closed gate). Her defining trait, being "quietly driven," is not merely stated but demonstrated through her disciplined ritual and the decisive, high-stakes choice to alter the pattern. The final change, from a cartographer of safety to a guide toward a 'terrible' truth, is a profound and earned transformation with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and potent, particularly in the moment she feels the “seductive pull” of the lie before her resolve steadies. The internal conflict between her inherited history and her scholarly mission provides strong grounding. The recurring label “emotionally rational” feels slightly told rather than shown, a minor tic in an otherwise well-realized characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, realizing the “stoically sensitive” attribute through embodied action rather than labels. Her internal conflict between professional duty and personal grief is dramatized through a series of escalating micro-choices, from the anonymous paper notes to the final, intimate inscription on stone. The motivation to become an "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is not just stated but proven by her every move, earning the story's emotional weight and making her final stance of acceptance feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's engine. Her character as a "logical page indexer" is skillfully demonstrated through her methodical hypothesis-testing, making her actions feel both credible and compelling. The final shift in her motivation—from tracing origins to actively rewriting them—is an earned and powerful change, rooted in the story's central discovery and carrying a palpable, albeit private, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is masterful and deeply embodied. Motivation is viscerally clear and drives every action. The protagonist's craft as a lantern maker is not a mere label but a lens through which she perceives the world, exemplified by the choice to pocket a tea leaf as "fuel." The final act of sacrificing her own happy dream demonstrates a profound change, an earned stasis where grief is transformed, not erased, at a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is viscerally clear, stemming from a foundational trauma that is never sentimentalized. The internal conflict is expertly dramatized—the cold, calculating "death's accountant" versus the grieving husband—culminating in the apparition of his bride. The final choice is a perfect, earned synthesis of these contradictory impulses, transforming grief into a final, precise act of agency with the ultimate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in family history. However, the pilgrim feels more like a thematic device than a fully realized character; his defining trait, "perpetually surprised," is stated and explained rather than embodied in a way that affects his actions or the plot. Mara's internal journey to the final choice feels slightly compressed, moving from hunter to believer in a single beat without a visible moment of internal contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, with a deeply felt internal contradiction between Mara's desire for peace and the guilt her actions generate. Her motivation is clear and compelling, and her final act of confession is earned through a series of specific, symbolic choices. The integration of her strange profession with her personal history creates a powerful and cohesive portrait of a woman haunted by a very specific sin.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority made concrete through the drawer pull and his specific, thoughtful actions like offering gloves. His internal contradiction is embodied in his goal to "recycle mistakes" while carrying a symbol of a past failure. The final change is earned and felt in the line "palms empty yet heavier," showing a credible internal shift with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation and internal conflict are powerfully established. The contradiction between her past self (certainty, charts) and her present need (wonder, instinct) drives the narrative compellingly. The change feels earned; however, some of the interiority slips into diagnostic self-awareness, stating thematic conclusions with a clarity that feels slightly external to a mind in crisis, as in "pain is just another form of percussion in the night’s orchestra."

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in the "delicately robust yearning." The protagonist's internal conflict is embodied in his choice to carve a path of "maybes," and his final transformation is earned through a decisive, costly action. The only minor weakness is a moment of over-articulated insight—"Empathy, he realized, isn’t kindness; it’s consent to fracture"—which slightly abstracts a feeling that the subsequent action embodies more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is established with poignant clarity ("I only asked for her") and drives every action. The internal conflict—fighting personal transformation to save another—is beautifully embodied in lines like "ribs brightening like lanterns, but I fought the change." The final choice to merge is a costly but inevitable culmination of a bond "older than fire," satisfying the 9+ test for earned causality and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority rendered through concrete, poetic embodiment. The internal conflict between clinging to grief and releasing it is dramatized through her actions, culminating in an earned change. The character's contradictory impulses are palpable in the "choking beauty" of her experience, and the final state of acceptance feels both profound and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Sister Halcyon’s motivation is rooted in a beautifully realized internal contradiction: she is the last pacifist, born from the artifacts of a dead species, yet her mission requires a joy immense enough to redeem their violence. Her central choice, “Mercy is the mirror I choose,” is a powerful crystallization of her steadfast nature, earned through her private rituals. The embodiment of her emotion in the ship’s physics is a masterstroke of concrete interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict is presented more as a series of received epiphanies than a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses. The transformation feels somewhat passive, orchestrated for her rather than won through a difficult internal battle. Her final understanding, while poignant, verges on diagnostic self-awareness ("she was not a philanthropist despite her poverty but because of it"), slightly flattening the emotional complexity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garnet's motivation is clear and compelling, embodied in the "cradle of sparks" concept. Her competence is well-dramatized in the climactic scene with Commander Voss, where her quick-witted deception demonstrates a seamless blend of her old role's discipline and her new revolutionary cunning. A minor weakness is the occasional slip into slightly overwrought interiority, like recognizing "the face of every child," which momentarily abstracts the otherwise grounded character.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and potent—a promise to his dying sister—but his characterization feels secondary to the story's high concepts. The precognitive curse functions more as a plot device that provides the solution than a true character flaw that forces difficult choices, rendering him somewhat passive. While his final shift from seeking understanding to accepting witness is the core of the story, his interiority reads as more of a philosophical vessel than a deeply felt, contradictory human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    The poet's motivation is rendered with exceptional clarity and depth, rooted in the physical and emotional cartography of her scars. Her interiority is consistently embodied through the story's central metaphors of photography and weather, avoiding any diagnostic summary. The final choice—to accept and re-contextualize her trauma rather than erase it—is profoundly earned by the preceding ritual, culminating in a credible and costly stance of endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Vela’s interiority is conveyed through her precise, purpose-driven actions—studying the sundial, tracing its path with the needle card. Her shift from a duelist seeking victory to an inviter seeking partnership is earned by the duel itself, culminating in the line, “Turn your question into a harbor.” Caelus’s transformation from antagonist to partner is powerfully shown, not told, in the moment he removes his vocoder, a gesture of profound vulnerability that lands with significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lark's internal transformation from a solitary "vagrant" to a "co-conspirator" is embodied in the physical act of molting and the collaborative rebuilding. Marin's motivation is established with remarkable economy in the Neruda flashback, making her subsequent risk-taking feel earned. The final choice to stand their ground is a powerful culmination of their shared purpose, with the cost of vulnerability and defiance made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The pianist’s motivation is powerfully established and embodied through her relationship with the clock. Her internal conflict between clinging to a promised past and composing an uncertain future is made concrete in the central choice. The final decision to play a "new chime" is an earned and satisfying culmination of her internal journey, demonstrating a credible change with a clear emotional cost—the forfeiture of a safe, if stagnant, hope.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, centered on a powerful internal conflict that is tested and resolved with a meaningful, permanent cost. The moment Calyx hesitates, "feeling the empirically whimsical tug between duty and self," is slightly told, but this is immediately redeemed by the dramatized sacrifice of her teacher's name, an action that makes her transformation visceral and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and particular, rooted in the abstract yet tangible goal of finding the "color of unspoken apologies." His interiority is rendered with beautiful precision, as his thoughts growing "like bonsai, dwarfed and deliberate," perfectly aligns his profession with his internal state. The final change is earned through a series of focused, ritualistic actions, and the cost of his long silence is felt, making his return credible.

    The undertaker’s interiority is vivid—salt on lips, unpaid debt to the dead—but the “inadvertently stubborn” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the brass tentacle cinches his ankle, making the final acceptance feel slightly under-cooked in motive.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her heart “hammering louder than the bell” after the felt slips—and her micro-choices (melting her exile permit for wax, painting tile numbers on bread) enact a believable hierarchy of values. The endurance she models is internally consistent, yet the final communal reading of Lila’s note is handed to the group rather than forcing Mara to a personal renunciation that costs her a live option; the cost is distributed, not individualized, keeping her arc just shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (petals “tasted purple,” fracture in chest), motives intensify from memory to shared healing; the man’s silhouette darkening the glass is a micro-choice that alters the scene. Relationship crucible is brief but credible: their synchronized breathing reconfigures withheld love. Cost is felt when the jade warms and the camera vanishes. Minor slip: man’s backstory is delivered in one expository line.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. release memory) act simultaneously in the final beats. The choice to crush the fragment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—her dissolution into the garden. Minor slip: “texture of time” drifts toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The liberator’s patient-strategic trait is embodied in every micro-choice (testing arrow balance, decoding keys, waltzing guards). Motivation—planting resilience—drives all tactics and is paid for by the lingering chain and the scattering of irreplaceable seed. The final smile and hum crystallize earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—collecting absences while fearing the void—drives every micro-choice; her decision to feed the forge her brother’s “echoless gap” crystallizes her flaw and costs her the illusion of innocence. The embodied emotion (palms on bark, stagger under color) grounds the arc without therapy-speak. Only the keeper’s dialogue feels slightly expository, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thief’s curiosity-driven motive is embodied in her tactile handling of portraits and moonbeams; the interior contradiction—cutting vs. restoring memories—surfaces in the ring-as-collateral beat. Micro-choice (returning the ring, not taking a new slice) crystallizes her stance with visible cost. Relationship pressure with the hooded woman is brief but legible, forcing a moral re-weighting.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her thawing heart is dramatized through tactile glasswork and self-narration. The contradiction between flight and caretaking is palpable, and her final renunciation (leaving the dome) carries earned cost. One minor slip: “emotional tectonic shift” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied arc by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s fear/identity contradiction is embodied in every beat; the trembling take becomes the earned spine. Interiority stays tactile—knees knocking, shell cupped to ear—never label-speak. The final choice to leak the reel crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible social cost. Micro-choice hierarchy (fear vs legacy) is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oracle’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her soles gripping wet stone, the booklet’s salt-swollen pages against her chest. Motivation (map the night) is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in the costly act of transposing the fort into the booklet. Mild obsession deepens into hunger, driving micro-choices (faster quill, refusal to let guard interrupt). Final renunciation—remaining alone inside the booklet—earns its cost through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    J4N-17’s evolving interiority—cold-burning touch, composite memory, the shift from curiosity to obsession—grounds its arc. The final renunciation (continuing to mop) crystallizes its earned stance with visible cost: eternal repetition as the price of consciousness. No secondary characters on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“pulse stumbled,” “heart drumming”), but the decisive renunciation (“I’m letting both go”) arrives with minimal dramatized cost; the forgiveness feels pre-cooked rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her cracked marbles, withered hands, and the glove that “fit her withered hand perfectly” anchor her contradictions. The central flaw (belief in mastery vs. servitude) is dramatized through micro-choices: placing marbles, biting the apple, accepting the glove. The final stance—renunciation of control with visible cost—earns its resonance because every beat has shown her tending the garden’s language. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory: the mechanic’s mechanical lungs hum in “companionship” rather than servitude, revealing layered acceptance and resistance. The refusal to file a report—an earned micro-choice—crystallizes her arc without tidy resolution. Only the younger self’s hesitation lacks full causal weight in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Musician’s liminal identity is vivid and embodied; interiority is specific and consistent. Ghost remains symbolic rather than a second character, so relationship crucible is N/A. Final acceptance of “between-spaces” identity is earned through micro-choices and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Oracle’s embodied fever-memory and micro-choices (sketching leaves, stepping into snow) reveal contradictory impulses; final renunciation of the stone costs her the oracle’s burden yet leaves her “temporarily innocent,” a credible Earned Stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jules’ reckless-explorer identity is shown through the single choice to enter the sealed factory, but the interiority stays lyrically general (“reckless… drowsy alertness”) rather than revealing a contradictory hierarchy of values under pressure; the final cost (beads clicking in his ribs) is felt, yet the turn from skeptical observer to ritual weigher of souls is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory—her loosening grip on reality is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (pressing palm to stone, folding the swan). Motive remains consistent: witness without judgment, foreclosing the path of certainty. The final renunciation—accepting eventual forgetting—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Minor slip: “mercy” and “decay” are asserted rather than dramatized once.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—embodied memory of “salt breath, lullaby hum” anchors her crisis—but her agency is largely symbolic; the decisive act is the whistle note, not a choice that costs her a path. The baby curl offers a micro-choice (press to wrist) that steadies her, yet the children’s gaze-climb feels externally granted rather than earned through her flaw or limit. Still, her contradictory impulse—fear the gift will fail vs. need to serve—plays in scene and the final renunciation (letting the note dissolve) forecloses spectacle in favor of quiet stewardship, a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific (“felt nothing, the way a tuning fork feels after the last note has gone”). Motive—collecting stories walls have heard—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation (becoming the axis) is earned and costly. Flaws and contradictions are present but not foregrounded; still, the arc is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Chen’s contradictory impulses—spy’s reflex to encode vs. sage’s urge to vanish—play out in embodied micro-choices (palming film, slipping fortune, rowing away). The final renunciation costs him identity and home, earned by prior beats where every fortune he wrote became shackles. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. Voice distinct in cadence and lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is richly rendered; the priest’s swallow of doubt with a mouthful of iron is palpable embodied cost. No knowledge drift or labeling voice; stakes tighten in proportion to fear. Cast abides single POV rule.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her lungs tasting iron, knees buckling—yet the “chronologically homesick” label is repeated without deeper contradiction. The nautilus shell as stylus and her grandmother’s conch give concrete, character-specific memory anchors. Final renunciation (laying down, cheek to glass) is earned and carries visible cost. Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael's desire to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is clear, but the interior logic is abstract; contradictory selves clash more conceptually than viscerally. The final obliteration of the tablet is an earned renunciation, but the minotaur's identity as "the sequence of choices" feels summarized, not embodied. Flaws remain gestural rather than lived, lowering from exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory internal impulses (“feel” versus “cannot hear” grief) are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—filing the needle, pressing shellac to skin—earning Renamed Stasis with the visible cost of open sobs. Temen’s steady counter-pressure via signed gestures tightens her final stance without diluting focus. Numbness as lived contradiction is embodied rather than diagnosed; no stock phrases intrude. One minor drift: the phrase “she welcomed it like a drumroll” flirts with tidy emotional arithmetic, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific; her “lantern in wind” motive drives every micro-choice. The contradiction between mapping truth and being used as a conduit is embodied in the act of writing backward logs. The final renunciation—choosing to stay underground—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interiority is precise and embodied; the contradiction between broker-calculation and raw grief is dramatized in every micro-choice (uncapping the vial, kneeling, pouring). The final renunciation—abandoning lantern-selling to become a “broker of invisible gardens”—is earned by the prior aromatic cautions and the orchid’s pulse. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “broker of invisible gardens” edges toward label-speak at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s interiority is textured and embodied—ink-stained fingers, rope-burns on skin—but the final refusal to transcend feels more asserted than earned; no prior beat shows the specific cost of staying flesh. Marcus’s off-stage escape supplies motive texture yet remains a narrative convenience rather than a crucible for the poet’s own choice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—honoring tradition yet refusing its finality—drive every micro-choice; the seed-planting, wire-bridge, and deliberate non-resolution all arise from her need to “unbind” the bowl from silence. Interiority is embodied in soot-smudged fingertips and the tremor she feels through soil, not labels. The cost—abandoning the bowl and the finished note—feels earned because her earlier refusal to resolve melodies foreshadows this renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—detachment vs. need for real feeling—are embodied in the petal beat; the final porous ache is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete (“vials sewn into the lining,” “pulse lied often and well”). Status tension with the chemist is legible but under-leveraged; no micro-choice from him alters her path. The coat vial crack is a perfect cost cue.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s quietly-compassionate broker is vivid via micro-choices (waiving fees, drafting NGO receipt); interiority stays concrete, contradiction shown in her need to stay anonymous. Relationship with Beto supplies secondary pressure and status shift. Final renunciation of the locket carries visible cost, earning closure under Accumulative lens. Voice remains distinct, though one beat of “therapy-speak” interiority (−0.3) keeps this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—solitude vs. kinship—are embodied in her peat-scented fingers and the reed-heart scar. Her choice to lift the tag rather than claim it crystallizes her arc with visible cost. The group’s growth from one to thirty-seven is choreographed cleanly, and every micro-choice (offering guidance, weaving reed arbors) reweights her social credit. Only the “boldly sympathetic” label feels slightly asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s grief-driven quest is embodied through precise micro-choices (the breath cadence, stepping against reversed water) and a credible renunciation of future minutes; interior contradiction surfaces in the ledger of borrowed time. The final acceptance of sealed memory carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conjurer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—reciting primes, feeling weight resolve into warmth—yet the master remains a cipher; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost, but the master’s absence never pressures a live choice, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his fingers tracing the tape, the scent of lavender water—but the shift from solitary caching to “I will not cache alone” is slightly under-motivated; the girl’s presence is too brief to act as crucible. The contradiction between hiding and revealing is dramatized in micro-choices (sliding fragments through knotholes), yet the final smile feels slightly safe, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—scientist’s need for control vs. plant empathy—drives every beat; embodied pain and micro-choices (clipping leaf, surrendering to veins) are specific and costly. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible bodily cost. Minor slip: “terrified” is a label, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s insomnia and artistic failure are embodied in raw eyes and tactile amber; her micro-choice to kneel and paint redefines her vigilance as gift. The old woman’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters Mara’s stance. Internal contradiction—failure vs. compulsion—remains active in scene. Cost is felt when she trades the painting for the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the pilgrim’s sensory surrender to the cave’s logic is credible. The clairvoyant’s renunciation—voice eroding into mineral song—carries visible cost. Motivation stays consistent: both seek magnification of the ordinary, but the transfer of sight is irreversible, foreclosing her future. Minor slip: her stagger backward feels slightly performative rather than earned by prior interior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s drive to “compile the echo” is concrete and embodied; every micro-choice (showing the valve, offering the satchel) is tethered to that want. Interior contradiction surfaces in the same moment he admits the satchel is empty—an honest, costly stance. The final blow of the trumpet is earned because he has physically re-assembled the instrument and emotionally accepted that his archive begins with absence. Cost is visible: he trades future testimony for the mouthpiece, foreclosing the easier path of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alden’s fear-of-color flaw and map-making compulsion are embodied in every beat; the punch-to-chest micro-choice crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Interior contradiction pulses in real time—precision vs. confession—without therapy-speak. The final act of painting with his own blood-blue is earned by every prior withheld word.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s skeptical interiority is embodied and contradictory; her shift from refusal to participatory listening is earned through tactile micro-choices and the cost of losing her mother’s rational refuge. The moment she “chose to listen instead of refute” crystallizes a credible, costly stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vey’s boredom and compulsion are embodied in magnetic hunger and corridor drift; the final renunciation (“I intend to discover”) is earned by centuries of exile and the amulet’s tug. Interior contradiction—longing for ending vs. fear of it—plays out in micro-choices: stepping forward, handing over the curse. Mortal leader’s aurora eyes give brief relational pressure, but Vey’s arc dominates. Cost is felt when darkness folds over him and the corridor brightens, emptier.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cassidy’s hierarchy of values—mother > memory > father—drives every micro-choice; the sacrificial trade of her last lullaby is embodied in the ink’s quiver and the missing-tooth ache. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and the final “equation balanced” renunciation is earned by the prior causal chain. Minor slip: “mathematics demands both sides lose” is slightly abstract in a peak beat, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelia’s contradictory impulses—desire to record versus fear of exhausting the world—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, tearing the page). The final renunciation of a forgery carries visible cost, but the interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction that blurs motive granularity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the survivor’s compulsion to collect fragments is dramatized through tactile beats. Contradictory impulses—longing for identity vs loyalty to chemical death—surface but remain more asserted than enacted in scene. The final “armor of borrowed existence” crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “grim knowledge that he was probably wrong” and heartbeat feeding the cello—but the final renunciation feels slightly under-motivated; the compass-pulse choice is more image than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s contradictory impulses—preserve vs. survive—surface in every beat (graffiti choice, midnight speech, sunrise sabotage). The stone chip embodies her lineage and doubt; its final release crystallizes an earned, costly stance. Interiority is textured, embodied, and specific; no therapy-speak. One minor slip: the “culture shock absorber” label is asserted rather than dramatized in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Inspector’s curiosity vs mourning is embodied in micro-choices—stealing the grain, burying half, delaying shutter—each with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“voice cracked on the last word”), emotions embodied through haptic heartbeat sync. Final renunciation (letting the anemones close) is earned by prior causality and carries felt loss. Minor slip: “purposefully curious” is once label-speak, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile reading of light spectra, the memory of the explosion, the micro-choice to teach the drone calm—yet the apprentice Col remains a cipher, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s dry wit and subtle confidence are shown through her refusal to answer the radio, her measured descent, and her final smile—each action rooted in her cataloguer’s discipline and quiet rebellion. Interiority is concrete (watching condensation, swallowing editorial instinct), and the moment she tears the map page carries visible cost. The flaw is that her childhood question about river origins is stated rather than embodied in a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is spare yet embodied—his broken-bell sacrifice and the hollowing of his own chest anchor motive. The final gift of heartbeat to stone crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost (his transparency). Relationships are off-stage, but the town-memory figures act as externalized crucible, forcing the climactic trade. One minor slip: “infinitely patient” is asserted more than dramatized until the final sway.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. duty, flee vs. stay—are embodied in salt-tears and bruised knees; the final renunciation (leaving the vial) costs her last anchor and is earned by the temple’s adoption of her memories. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no stock labels. The lone POV keeps focus tight, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—yearning to absolve his father yet refusing to become silence—are embodied in the pipe and lattice; the final renunciation (“I will not become it”) is earned and carries visible cost as the reef vanishes and the lighthouse folds.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ghost bride’s contradictory impulses—loving mercy and lethal poison—are embodied in every beat; her final dissolution into river-salt carries the cost of centuries-old guilt. The boy’s arc from captive to chosen is cleanly motivated by the bead’s heat and her touch. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the boy’s voice lacks full individuation, keeping this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Calyx’s surrender to the canyon’s stitching is embodied in sleepwalking, bleeding, and sewing; the interior contradiction between dread and hope is palpable. Motivation intensifies from passive haunting to active sacrifice, culminating in the palm-prick that costs blood and the plate. The Earned Stasis—returning to the empty wharf humming—shows the price of endless service. Yet the lack of secondary pressure or relationship crucible keeps it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The returnee’s contradictory pull between exile and home is embodied in tactile beats (cradling the sundial, planting a cleaned rib). Her final choice to stay and teach costs her mobility, earned by prior causal chain. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels. The boy’s status shift from wary guard to co-builder is legible but brief, so relationship crucible is only lightly charged.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for self-revelation vs. clinging to anonymity—drive every beat. Micro-choices (slipping the unsigned letter, wiping the chalk spiral) crystallize her hierarchy of values and the cost of refusal. The final Earned Stasis—keeping the confession unread—feels inevitable from prior causality. Only a slight reserve: the childhood postcard beat is summary, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Embroiderer’s contradictory impulses—secrecy vs exposure—are dramatized in the act of stitching; her micro-choice to reverse the children’s song into death-names crystallizes her values. Interiority is concrete (“thread fibers crackling”). Final renunciation of violence via lullaby carries visible social cost: she remains alone, candle trimmed, sky unfinished.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s guilt and longing pulse through every beat. The brother’s frozen fourteen-year-old self is sketched with aching specificity. Motivation—seeking the unspoken apology—drives every micro-choice. Cost is felt when the shard dissolves and the letters become moths.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The translator’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tasting cordite, feeling coral ridges—but the moment of “confessing the birthday” is slightly over-articulated, blunting the internal contradiction. The micro-choice to voice the knots is well-motivated and carries cost. Relationship pressure is minimal; the boy is more oracle than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Luma’s contradictory impulses—clutching grief while coaxing light—are embodied in micro-choices (pocketing the warm shard, painting with her own pooled light). The final renunciation of souvenirs in favor of internalized joy is earned by the prior cost of each brushstroke. Interiority is specific and painterly, avoiding therapy-speak. Minor cap at 8.7 because the grandfather remains off-page, so relationship pressure is inferred rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—craving certainty yet yielding to wonder—plays out in embodied micro-choices (spoon vs nickel, inversion of color). Each nested self enacts the same flaw, compounding cost until she renounces finality. The nickel’s warmth and the draining palette make the price tactile. Motivation stays character-bound; no stock epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlo’s contradictory impulses—taxed dreams vs. subversive planting—are dramatized in real time; the final smile and sprint crystallize his rogue stance with visible cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent. Minor slip: Inspector Voss remains a cipher, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zale’s centuries-long insomnia and poetic calling are vividly embodied in his tactile rituals and micro-choices (pressing forehead to limestone, peeling the postcard). The internal contradiction—exhaustion versus compulsion—drives every beat. His final act of sealing the postcard into the shell earns the Earned Stasis: he renounces further sleepless vigil, accepting the cost of ordinary time. The only minor slip is a slightly abstract “smiled in his sleep,” but the prior embodied detail outweighs it.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her foxglove heart closing, the memory of Por’s kiss, the foxglove regret on her tongue—yet her contradictory impulses (preserve names vs. erase self) are stated more than dramatized in real time. The final self-sacrifice is foreshadowed but feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with in-scene. Still, her embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are vivid and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her contradictory impulses (caution vs. reckless daring) play out in real time as she dips the pen. The embodied cost of speaking the language (tasting ash, sternum vibration) makes the final renunciation legible. Grandmother’s laughter returning supplies earned emotional closure without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mireya’s contradictory impulses—duty to the Council vs. empathy for the Gardeners—are dramatized in every beat; the final compromise is earned through the chain’s re-calibration and Corin’s trust, costing her absolute safety and absolute control.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mirela’s contradictory impulses—flight vs. preservation, guilt vs. hope—are embodied in the meteorite chip and Inkspot; her renunciation of the old identity and final dispersal of the song feel earned by prior micro-choices and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Juniper’s barefoot reading of floorboards and her father’s logbook codes ground interiority in tactile micro-choices; the final “invent their own way home” crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Motive remains consistent—discovering thresholds—yet the causal link between wood-grain decoding and maze-entry feels slightly abstract, blurring the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astrologer’s interior contradiction—scientific observer vs. ritual participant—remains vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to exhale into the moon-pipe crystallizes the arc. Yet the ghost-partner is a narrative convenience: he supplies memory, chalk, and final pinions without ever pressuring or testing her stance, so the “belonging” feels bestowed rather than wrested. Still, her body remembers the cadence, so the endurance cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“tide of half-remembered songs”), but the sacrifice—trading personal memory for others’ stories—arrives as retrospective summary rather than a dramatized choice under present pressure. Micro-choices (pressing palm, planting seeds) are vivid yet feel ritualized, not fraught. The final beat of smiling through tears earns resonance, though the cost is more declared than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cass’s interiority is vivid—her “weatherproof notebook” and “lightly attentive” stance embody her analytical obsession. The contradiction between orchestrating wonder and erasing her own presence is dramatized when she “became part of the audience.” The final renunciation—dropping the duplicate bishop—carries visible cost: she forfeits control to the tide. Minor slip: the boy’s interiority is ventriloquized without clear POV cue.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysira’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her exile is both chosen and endured, and the moonstone dust becomes a tactile extension of her will. The final fledge into verse is earned by prior renunciation and the visible cost of burning the last grain. Minor drift: “obsidian grace” recurs as label rather than lived sensation, blunting peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to hurl the prism reconfigures the town’s windows and seals her renunciation of solitary hoarding. The scar-as-constellation beat crystallizes contradictory impulses—self-wounding yet self-mapping—under pressure. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the earned stasis (accepting future cracks) carries visible cost. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—survivor’s guilt vs. the need to speak—are dramatized in the ash-on-tongue beat and the spiral drawn with tear-ink; each micro-choice costs him skin, salt, visibility. The interior arc from mute carrier to commissioned speaker is earned, not announced, and the final renunciation of secrecy lands with palpable weight.

    Mira’s interiority is vivid—equations in sleep, proofs in hair—yet the “logical dreamer” label is asserted more than dramatized; her contradictory impulses surface only in the final equation, not earlier beats. The cost of her choice (blood drop, gauge reset) is felt, but the flaw/virtue tension could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her throat “rising like a stone” when the name surfaces. The contradiction between her professional detachment and inherited guilt is dramatized in the tunnel walk, where each negative touch forces a micro-choice to keep going. The final renunciation—becoming the corridor—carries a visible cost: her own erasure. Voice and motive remain coherent throughout, though the great-grandmother’s psyche is only sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The painter’s interiority is vivid—her borrowed heartbeat syncs with song, her choice to dance instead of flee crystallizes her arc, and the cost of shared rather than stolen life is felt. Motivation remains consistent, but the child-donor stays off-page, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her reflection… beauty flawed by responsibility”), but the negotiator’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in real time; the final renunciation is earned yet telegraphed.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses—guilt vs. preservation—are embodied in salt-tears and split nails; the final renunciation (leaving the egg) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“he’d heard them too, every night since the rivers died”). Flawed sentimentality complicates choices without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lys’s interiority is rich—her chaste status, stolen memories, and bodily poetic all collide in the final renunciation. The contract burning in ash and her barefoot blood-dew prints crystallize a credible, costly shift from commodity to conduit. Minor drift: “alarming serenity” is repeated rather than deepened. Still, the earned stasis feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lucien’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“ink-stained fingers,” “parchment-like skin”), but the reversal sequence is narrated more than dramatized; the final choice to “letter…with questions” is earned yet feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—grief-driven preservation vs. acceptance of dissolution—play out in the micro-choice to cage yet release the wing. The final renunciation (letting the memorial ascend) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her tears and emptied pocket. No relationship crucible is on-page, so that bullet is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction crystallizes in the moment the rope lifts—“tears freezing into lenses that cracked when I smiled”—showing simultaneous grief and release; the caster’s shift from guilt to carrier is embodied and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Foresight’s interiority is vivid—born “without a future or a past” anchors her paradoxical identity—but the story withholds concrete micro-choices until the final ascent. Her consent to be “worn smooth” crystallizes as earned stasis, yet earlier beats lean on lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Naram-bel’s frugality, fear of empirical irony, and devotion to his sister are embodied in concrete micro-choices (bartering barley, whispering her name, pressing the tile to the door). The final renunciation—becoming “the silence between regimes”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only minor drift: the sister remains off-page, so relationship crucible is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—pacifist schemer—drives every beat; the shadow-Lira crystallizes her unacknowledged anger, forcing embodied renunciation. Micro-choices (setting the box down, touching the shadow) visibly cost her. Emotional arc from denial to acceptance is embodied, not labeled. Slight abstraction in “cellular memory” risks diagnostic speak but is grounded by tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mirror-maker’s contradictory impulses—capture versus release—are dramatized in the final orchard beat; the renunciation costs him his original craft purpose, felt in the lighter-pocket/heavier-heart image. Interiority stays concrete, anchored to frost, fog, and brass. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent by scope. Flaw drives mistake: erasing boundaries traps him inside one; recognition lands with embodied chill.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mender’s contradictory impulses—rage at the council’s betrayal versus tenderness for the orchard and her child—are embodied in every gesture (ribbon as pendulum, copper biting bark). Her final refusal to admit the elders until the orchard “decides” crystallizes a stance earned by prior grafting and pollen ritual. The only drag is a slight drift toward archetype (“endearingly feisty” used twice without fresh inflection). Still, the cost—sleeping seven nights under the graft, risking total failure—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—hunger for knowledge vs. dread of entrapment—are embodied in the cheek-held shell and the burn pile; her final renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority is vivid and specific (“smooth impossible nut”). Only minor drift: the bathroom epiphanies risk tidy packaging.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is embodied in concrete micro-choices (folding the page-compass, crushing the verbena), but interior contradiction is thin; the time traveler remains a prop rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. Motivation sharpens late—stealing absences for the world—yet the cost (one year off her death) is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cassia’s interiority is vivid—dreams bleeding green, coat of childhood dropping away—but the chimera’s motives remain opaque; her final renunciation of identity is earned by the thread-weaving journey yet lacks a visible cost on her body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interior contradictions (archivist curiosity vs. emotional cost of opening the absented door) are dramatized through tactile choices; the final palm print is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete—her learned stillness, tactile handling of ice, and final whispered act all reveal motive and contradiction. Jalen’s presence supplies relational pressure, but his interiority is generic. The earned renunciation (releasing the stories into silence) carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her earlier “futures in frozen fractures.” Minor voice convergence at climax prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“retrocognition spill like hot metal”), motives intensify toward the final stance crystallization, but the mother/child threads are told more than dramatized, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s interior contradiction—yearning to preserve while forced to surrender—grounds every beat; the sleeve-fabric tribute literalizes cost. Yet the borrowed-memory device tips toward abstraction, muting embodied stakes at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Luma’s interiority is concrete—her worn hopelessness feels embodied—but the motivational link from “every village left behind” to her decision to ascend relies more on lyrical assertion than dramatized causality, so the final leap feels slightly under-credited.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicler’s interiority is textured and embodied; her tangential method and tactile attention to tide-pool life reveal contradictory impulses—flight from confrontation vs. longing for reconnection. The jade cicada as inherited pulse anchors her grief and patience, charging the final hand-off with felt cost. Micro-choices (shifting lantern, writing “texture,” offering the carving) all tilt the relationship under pressure. Only slight reserve: the daughter’s interiority is implied rather than dramatized, keeping the crucible slightly one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s claustrophobia and need to “stretch her lungs” are embodied in every plank-step and silence-taste; the porcelain doll externalizes her internal conflict and the final renunciation carries palpable cost. Interiority stays specific—no therapy-speak—and the micro-choice to release the stored silences is earned by the prior accumulation. The keeper interaction supplies brief but clear status pressure. Minor slip: the father’s oxygen-bottling backstory is told, not dramatized, but it primes rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nilo’s interiority is embodied in micro-choices—easing the throttle, tuning the dial to zero—each aligning with his inherited vocation and the story’s hush ethic. The commuter’s single spoken fear lands as a credible cost that reconfigures Nilo’s stance, sealing the arc. No stock labels; motives remain character-bound and contradictory (comfort vs. vigilance). Minor: commuter’s pulse is the only external pressure, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lore-keeper’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile tracing of the ruby flake and the weight of the crown settling on her head carry cost. Motivation deepens from curiosity to inherited duty, and the final renunciation of power for stewardship is earned. Minor slip: “wisely adventurous” is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“loaded emptiness,” “teaching herself to suffocate”), but the keeper’s final choice—continuing to practice suffocation—feels more stated than dramatized; the boy’s arc lands harder than hers.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt, defiance, and opportunism—are embodied in every micro-choice; the bolt-diamond conversion crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The final refusal of unpaid labor lands as earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s interiority is richly embodied (“tears mixing with dust to make pale mud”), motives escalate from curiosity to public confession, and the final renunciation of name carries palpable cost. The dynasty-ender identity is dramatized through micro-choices (fitting the crank, tearing the map, lifting the bloodied page) rather than labels. Minor deduction for Muse’s off-stage presence that never applies direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the knight’s contradictory desire to both keep and break his oath is dramatized through tactile contact with the seed and the puppet. The final renunciation—planting the seed and removing the helmet—carries visible cost and is earned by prior beats. Minor slip: the genealogy reveal is slightly expository rather than acted upon.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—staying for money vs. waiting for kindness—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (brushing dust, sealing the envelope). The final act of placing the button in Marcus’s file is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she relinquishes the private talisman that linked her to her uncle. Minor slip: the “broken-hearted” label is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on the damp boardwalk, the key clenched “like a fuse.” Contradictory impulses (fear vs. defiance) coexist in scene, and her final choice to wire the booth to the broadcast tower is earned by prior resourceful micro-choices. The only slight drag is the late exposition about erased lullabies; it feels summary rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The saxophonist’s interiority is embodied and specific—his cracked shoes, the reed fluttering like a trapped moth, the copper taste of a diminished chord. Motivation (to hush the prophecy) is clear and intensifies through micro-choices that alter fingering and breath. The final renunciation—erasing the note before it is heard—earns its cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor slip: the mother’s prophecy is recalled rather than dramatized, slightly softening the causal link.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mireya’s quiet, methodical interiority and embodied micro-choices (counting seeds to calm herself, pressing moon-dust monuments to anchor leaves) stay consistent and specific; the climactic utterance “Reciprocity” is earned by her steady, escalating risk on the drifting arbor. Flaw: no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene to deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his craving for certainty vs. his eventual embrace of uncertainty—are dramatized in concrete beats (pocketing the compass, wading into the pool, leaving both artifacts). The final renunciation carries visible cost: he abandons his trade and identity. Interiority is specific to his tinkerer’s lens (“tick he carried in his bones”). Minor slip: the admiral’s phantom arc is off-page, diluting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alder’s grief-driven choices (melting the coin, kintsugi-ing the mirror) are embodied and irreversible; the internal contradiction—love vs. guilt—drives every beat. The final renunciation (slipping the silver tube into the downspout) costs him any further claim to her name, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her ritual with the crocodile tooth and the “modestly fearless” heartbeat anchor her motives. The micro-choice to press the tooth against the harp string crystallizes her values and carries a felt cost (the child’s laughter entering her ribs). Minor slip: “modestly fearless” is label-adjacent but is immediately embodied in her silent stance under the gorge’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is embodied in the spasm-memory loops; the “mathematics of mercy” want collides with bodily cost. Micro-choice—tearing the strap—earns a visible wound and forecloses return. Slight over-articulation of the math metaphor keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are vivid; the adult’s decision to surrender the shard to child-self crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Motivation—honoring overlooked histories—drives every beat and the final renunciation. Micro-choices (leaning into the painting, singing the lullaby backward) are character-specific and pressurized. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “I understand now that intuition is not a compass but a tide,” but it is brief and does not undercut the earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s technician mindset and ghost-seer burden collide in embodied micro-choices—prying the vent, gauging spring tension—each action revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the spring half-wound) costs her the fantasy of full absolution, earned by prior causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Corwin’s trembling fingers, cracked chase heart, and ink-soaked skin give embodied motive; the bottled whisper and frost grammar anchor his contradictory drive to rupture yet preserve. Interiority is concrete—“letters kept falling out of order”—but the mirror-keeper’s warning stays ornamental, never forcing a micro-choice. The final step onto cloud is earned: he pays with the orchard folding into a heartbeat glyph, renouncing safe ground. Still, the keeper remains off-stage, so status dynamics are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aurelio’s contradictory impulses—defeat versus symbolic action—are embodied in the bleeding shard and the scratched line; the final renunciation (“the poem remains”) is earned. Mira functions as secondary pressure, but their relationship lacks crucible force. Interiority is concrete, though a touch of diagnostic self-awareness creeps in at “footnotes could still be rewritten.”

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the confession to the rust is specific and costly. The daughter remains off-stage, yet her absence drives the final choice with felt weight. Motivation intensifies cleanly from personal to civic stakes. No contradictions or therapy-speak intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ivy’s contradictory urges—collector vs. delver, rescuer vs. tribute—are dramatized in every beat; the final surrender of the compass arises from an accumulated chain of embodied choices and leaves her transformed at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maela’s contradictory impulses—yearning to decipher the slide yet yielding to the storm’s violence—play out in embodied micro-choices (wedging the slide, carving with memory). Her final renunciation of GPS is earned by the prior ritual and carries visible cost (loss of certainty). Interiority is specific and sensory; no stock therapy-speak. Flaw: “perpetually learning” is asserted more than dramatized beyond the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—dawn painter seeking night bloom—is embodied in her micro-choices (pinning postcards, lying under branch-rose-window). The final renunciation—leaving the pavilion—earns its cost via the indigo panes she can now paint but abandons. Minor slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mireya’s contradictory impulses—protecting her mother’s memory vs. publishing the truth—are dramatized in the lagoon’s bargain; the final choice to broadcast the diaries is earned by the visible cost of “years rearrange inside me.” Interiority is concrete, embodied, and stakes escalate with each offered future. Minor slip: the betrayal revelation is delivered via page rather than dramatized interaction, slightly muting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Veyra’s defiant refusal of comfort and steady internal accumulation of memories give strong interior contradiction; the climactic smashing of the amber bottle crystallizes her renunciation with a visible sacrificial cost that closes the path of false answers.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ambrose’s lifelong compulsion to archive is embodied in every gesture; the wax shaving forces a micro-choice that re-weights his vow. Interior contradiction—archive vs. silence—plays out in real time, culminating in the Earned Stasis of accepting the foghorn inside him. Cost is palpable: he forfeits solitude and becomes the city’s grief vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“borrowed time grated against her ribs”), motives escalate from preservation to self-sacrifice; the final renunciation (remaining as archivist) is earned by the prior surrender of heat. Minor slip: “wild serenity” is asserted more than dramatized in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her chilled fingers, the faint pine-tar scent of the rope, the way her father’s absence still shapes her silence. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs obedience, civic duty vs mountain courtesy) play out in real time, culminating in the costly decision to reroute the siren. The final renunciation—leaving the toggle in place—earns its weight through prior causality and visible risk. Minor: the “credibly curious” label is stated once rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    The janitor’s grief-driven spiritual curiosity is vivid and embodied; his micro-choice to speak to reflections and later leave the dome open crystallizes a believable arc from isolation to openness. Interior contradiction—grief for a planet that “forgot how to look up”—and embodied emotion carry through the vision sequence. The final renunciation (trading the lantern’s external glow for an internal one) lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost. However, the meteor’s “question” is slightly abstract-therapy phrased, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alden’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “tranquilly perceptive” stance is dramatized through tactile ritual and soot-stained fingers. The contradiction between his vow of silence and the whispered promise at the climax is earned by the child-ghost’s transfer of weight. Motivation is rooted in regret and covenant, intensifying when the fracture threatens the ghosts’ memory. The final choice carries visible cost: he accepts the burden of holding every unspoken word forever.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The timekeeper’s interiority is vivid—his tactile rubbing of the urn shard, the taste of “iron like blood from a bitten minute”—but his choices remain largely observational. The final exchange of the shard for a snow globe is a micro-choice that crystallizes his shift from collector to participant, yet the cost feels gentle rather than irreversible. Relationships are absent, so the crucible is internal; the arc is credible but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s interiority is embodied in micro-choices—tucking the feather, tuning the string, drawing the spiral—each revealing his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (letting the spiral dissolve) is earned by the prior accumulation of attention and carries visible cost. The woman remains functional rather than individuated, but the poet’s contradiction between completion and acceptance is dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mateo’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the diary, wire, and root choices reveal a hierarchy of values. The final self-wiring is earned by prior systematic care and the bat epiphany. Minor slip: “gently systematic” is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s skepticism and drive are embodied in concrete micro-choices—tracing the pendant, sampling footprints, mapping the pilgrimage—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“understood then,” “refused to accept”) rather than live contradiction. The final resolve to warn the city is earned, but the emotional cost is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s grief-rooted motive and ritualized action are embodied and consistent; the micro-choice to accept the rusted button crystallizes his stance. Interiority is rich yet avoids label-speak. The Earned Stasis—leaving without home—carries visible cost, though the interior contradiction could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Scraps’ shift from corpse-tracker to courier of closeness is embodied in every scent-translated choice; Kite’s trembling fingers and barefoot landing show stakes. Motivation is rooted in the hound’s sensory vocation and the girl’s loss, culminating in the brother’s emergence where “distance kneels.” Minor slip: brother’s interiority is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s survivor-guilt and filial devotion are embodied in tactile rituals (compass, sketchbook) and contradictory impulses—grief vs. need to rejoin the living. The final hand-take is earned by prior causal chain: compass twitch → voice → crawlspace → corridor. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak. Cost is visible: he abandons linear time and station life forever.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vespers’ contradictory impulses—thief’s daring vs mentor’s caution—play out in scene (sacrificing queen, swapping bishop). Interiority is concrete, embodied (knuckles white, boots skimming rim). Final renunciation of mentorship object carries visible cost. Minor: Halcyon’s fear feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—archivist tenderness vs. ruthless excision—are dramatized in the lace-noose gesture and the final shared walk; Kestrel’s blankness cracks only when he kneels for a name. Interiority is embodied, never diagnostic. The cost of her vow is visible in the abandoned rifle and the moving eclipse she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her mercury skin, the stone’s hum, the feather’s weight all act as externalized emotion. The buried-talent motif is dramatized through micro-choices (pressing stone to arm, lifting feather) rather than summary. The final renunciation—accepting the pain of memory to reclaim her gift—carries visible cost as the glass flakes away. Minor: the old man’s dialogue edges toward thematic echo, not quite subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marek’s guilt, pride, and need for atonement are embodied in tactile fidgeting and micro-choices (righting the fallen king). The lone-king stitch pattern externalizes his self-blame and offers a credible path to self-forgiveness. The final pocketing of the king crystallizes earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus defiance—are embodied in the mirror-shard ritual; the final acceptance of cost (“I accept the cost”) is earned by prior causality and visibly paid when the spire cracks and yields the feather.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to save memory yet fearing the cost—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned by the prior liturgy of dots and the workshop’s audible countdown. Embodied emotion (trembling masked by rebreather, acid on chains) stays specific. Only minor slip: “uncertain alchemist” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ren’s contradictory impulses—yearning to preserve the quay yet abandoning it—are embodied in micro-choices (cutting his thumb, leaving the door unlocked). The final renunciation of the shell/canvas in the cave carries visible cost and crystallizes his arc. Interiority is specific, salted with memory rather than label-speak. One hairline slip: “intimately aloof” is stated more than dramatized until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.7)
    The keeper’s arc hinges on a single, silent decision to transmit love at dawn; interior contradictions remain poetic but lack visceral cost, and reliance on metaphor can verge on abstraction. Earned stasis qualifies, but the shift feels more mythic than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is richly embodied (“copper wiring of her throat”) and motives deepen through tactile micro-choices (soldering hair, stepping into spiral). Final renunciation—becoming the place others will navigate—earns its cost via prior causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s rational armor cracks under the orchard’s pressure, culminating in the earned stasis of staying to tend the confessional grove. The sister’s ghost arrives too late to test status dynamics, so relationship crucible is only implied. Micro-choices (planting the eye, threading the glass lanterns) crystallize values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to keep the memory vs. release it) act simultaneously in the climactic release of the Edelweiss. The micro-choice to pin then surrender the flower crystallizes her arc with visible cost—loss of personal memories—earning the final “Repaid.” Only the stranger remains a cipher, but that serves the thematic design.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the doorway yet fearing its cost—are embodied in the warm pulse of the matrix chip and the final refusal to step through; the micro-choice to leave the shop unlocked crystallizes his earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The queen’s contradictory impulses—laughter at prophecy, then urgent ascent—are embodied in her soaked slippers and fever-warm palms. Her micro-choice to step onto the dais crystallizes a value hierarchy (kingdom over self) with visible erasure cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. The final smile earns the Earned Stasis closure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Corin’s interior contradiction—scientific quantifier vs. presence seeker—drives every beat; the shell transfer crystallizes his renunciation with embodied cost. Mira’s single gesture reconfigures their shared history without exposition. Micro-choice of crushing the pocket-sun seals the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chronicler’s contradictory impulses (to record vs. to vanish) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—laying the scroll in the snow—earns its cost through prior grief for a life not yet lived. Minor drift: the “jaded wonder” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her “trembling calm” recurs and deepens. Micro-choices (rotating the screw, pocketing it) trace motive to cost. The shift from regaining smell to midwifing stories is earned via tactile epiphany. Only a hairline slip: the final pocketing feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s contradictory impulses—terror vs trust, revision vs grief—are embodied in the crystallizing breath and quill fracture. The micro-choice to finish the twelfth stroke despite needles in her lungs earns the spiral release. Brother’s fall and her held-breath ritual anchor motive without exposition dump. Cost is visible: quill snaps, rock rises, silence changes texture.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirage’s interiority is vivid—her self-advising metaphors, the embodied shame of “gossip drain from her like ink”—and her micro-choices (tilting the bottle, writing the confession) reconfigure the relationship with visible cost. Julian’s spectral presence supplies relational pressure that forces her stance crystallization. Flaws and contradictions (profiting from pain, fear of flat notes) drive the final renunciation. Only a hairline slip: Julian’s late articulation of “pain is public domain” edges toward thematic label rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    The witness’s interior contradiction—detached cartographer vs. seeker of unification—drives every micro-choice; her slow erasure of self-identity is embodied in the dictionary’s swallowing of memories, culminating in the felt cost of becoming “pure notation.” Motivation remains rooted and intensifies through each spiral circuit. No stock phrasing; embodied emotion anchors the cosmic stakes to bodily sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Torvald’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“key grew warm in his pocket, responding to his racing pulse”), but his contradictory impulses are summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation—turning the key counterclockwise—earns its cost through the prior dream-telegram link, yet the shift from guardian to “the space between memory and possibility” feels asserted rather than lived. No secondary character pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s grief-driven need to recover her brother powers every beat; her spatial gift is dramatized through laser-guided mapping and the final hand-to-heart merge. Interiority stays embodied (“breath fogging,” “pulse racing”) and the twin-heartbeat moment crystallizes her cost. The only drag is Dr. Voss’s brief expository line, but Maya’s micro-choice to relinquish both Lucs overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—rational caution vs. reckless pursuit—are dramatized in every beat: subway hunts, track jump, final choice to burn the lantern. Interiority is embodied (throat filling with clover melancholy, eye split in mica). The micro-choice to write a new scrawl and leave it burning costs her the scavenger hunt’s resolution and reconfigures her stance toward probability and her father. No unmotivated leaps; knowledge stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is concrete and character-specific; the operator’s estrangement is embodied in ritualized micro-choices (wiping condensation, logging zero calls). The final renunciation—handing over the disc and leaving the booth—earns its cost through the prior loop of self-cultivated isolation. Only minor slip: the woman’s “memory that has kept you alive” edges toward therapeutic summary rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Archivist’s interiority pulses through every choice—ink, locket, tube—showing contradictory impulses (preserve vs. relinquish) in scene. Micro-choice of sealing the locket inside the tube crystallizes her hierarchy of values and exacts visible cost. Daughter’s gap-toothed echo deepens the personal stake without exposition. Flaw: “haunted euphoria” label edges toward diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s jocular mask and moon-rock hope create a credible internal contradiction; her decision to share the shard with the boy crystallizes her arc. The boy’s shift from conductor to lonely kid is sketched rather than embodied, limiting depth. Motivations remain consistent, but secondary pressure from their relationship is under-developed.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"citrus on his tongue," "tremor in the air"—and the ring’s weighting with extinct birds’ consonants shows a micro-choice that alters tactics. The final renunciation (ring emptied into soil) is earned by the spiral of pressure and carries visible cost. Minor deduction for a touch of therapeutic self-labeling near the end ("to navigate uncharted emotional depths").

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—confidence vs uncertainty—are dramatized in the pen’s dry scratch and the floating moment; the final choice to plant spiral-questions shows earned change with visible cost (power drain, gravity slack). Interiority is concrete and embodied, though the mentor’s proverb edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—returning to erase herself yet seeking music in silence—are embodied in her empty-camera ritual; the final click against her own face crystallizes renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded, though the advisor remains a cipher whose pressure is more atmospheric than interpersonal. Motivation is coherent, but the advisor’s lack of interiority weakens relationship-as-crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ember’s pyromania-as-revelation arc is embodied in tactile choices (tracing soot, pressing warm fragment), but the grandmother’s deathbed whisper is summary, not dramatized pressure. Interior contradiction flickers (“destruction’s dual nature”) yet never forces a costly micro-choice on the page. Final self-redefinition lands with felt cost—she emerges “keeper of a truth”—but the absence of live opposition keeps the crucible cool.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is visceral and embodied—her drumming fingers, grief-tight chest, barefoot skim of auric water. Twin loss compresses into percussion, interior contradiction pulses (erase vs keep Lila). The final dispersal is earned by prior micro-choice steps into luminous fusion—“quiet rebellion” crystallizes into self-dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s embodied expertise (gait-reading, map-creases) and micro-choice to test the whisper challenge crystallize her arc; the final realization that maps are incomplete without sound carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the stranger’s motivation is slightly abstract, nudging the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian’s mute interiority is embodied in micro-choices—adjusting shutters, raising the mirror—yet the “half-spoken secret” remains abstract, softening the final cost. Motivation is consistent but not sharply escalated; the dance of light feels ritual more than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heard unspoken words the way other people heard wind”), but the late arrival of Ellis and the crowd dilutes sustained interior pressure; the final renunciation is earned yet feels slightly collective rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—duty vs. motion—are embodied in every beat; the final unmaking of the harpoon crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, voice-specific, and never diagnostic. The dock-worker grace threads through action without exposition. One hairline slip: the council’s plea feels slightly generic, not fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“blank-faced” never lapses into label-speak); contradictory impulses (reporting neighbors vs forging coupons) are dramatized in the present whittling beat. Micro-choices (shaving angle, labeling the scrape “dirge”) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation—planting bare stems—earns cost via prior causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    The poet’s interiority is vivid—her pulse as recusant signature, her aesthetic creed driving each step—but we never see contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the risk of mispronunciation is stated, not dramatized. The final couplet crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied. Still, the voice is singular and the arc coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s colorblindness and longing for unseen hues are embodied in tactile searching and trembling hands; the marble eye’s gift forces a visible cost—fractured, violent color that redefines his art. Rosa’s “innocently cunning” smile and reed-behind-ear gesture show status shift and mutual awakening. Final renunciation of painting for living arrangements earns closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell ringer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tracing the cracked lens, her voice “propelling itself across the room.” Yet her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. transform) are stated more than dramatized in scene, and the final renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than paid for by a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The jewelry maker’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices—folding vellum, placing cranes—yet interiority drifts toward abstract “teaching the dead to bloom” rather than dramatized contradiction. The final renunciation (leaving the observatory) is earned by the origami constellation she leaves behind, carrying visible cost of dissolved stencil and decade of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartomancer’s interior contradiction—scientific mapping versus mystical belief—drives every micro-choice; her barefoot grid-walk and sealing of the map in a coffee tin crystallize an earned renunciation with visible cost. Motive intensifies from curiosity to custodial duty, culminating in the charged poise of leaving footprints as ghost protocol. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the flaw of obsessive pattern-seeking compounds until the final silence. The 9+ quick test is met: contradictory impulses act in scene and the final choice is causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied ("sweat absorbed by saffron veil"), but the historian’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned by micro-choices under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is precise and embodied; the stone’s warming triggers a visible micro-choice (carrying it to the vault) that escalates stakes. The final renunciation—locking her heartbeat in the drawer—earns its cost through forty years of catalogued dusks and filial promise. Shadow-as-second-heart externalizes contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. Only the mother remains off-page, limiting relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miren’s contradictory impulses—self-reckoning vs. duty to Aster—are embodied in concrete micro-choices (removing ring, cutting tail tips, opening cage). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of reputation, pride, and possession). Interiority is specific and sensory; no stock therapy-speak. The only minor slip is a brief diagnostic label “self-respect and compassion finally stood side by side,” which slightly flattens the embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the scar-splitting choice is foreshadowed and paid for with blood. Motive—trade fresh loss for the miracle—drives every beat. Micro-choice of swallowing the seed crystallizes earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for stored love yet fearing its release—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (handling the reel, scratching new lyrics). Her final renunciation of the blank letter carries visible cost: the wax seal broken, ashes in pocket. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; her spatial imagination alters tactics under pressure. The only minor slip is a faint therapeutic gloss in “love unused is not gone,” quickly redeemed by the film-strip splice image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the dreamer’s contradictory impulses—obedience to sky-warning vs. self-dissolution—play out in tactile beats. The final renunciation (dismantling then merging with the instrument) is causally earned and costly. Yet the childhood wound is summarized more than dramatized, muting the flaw’s compounding force.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guard’s interiority is sparse but consistent—dreamlessness, duty, and the ritual of naming anchor his choices. The final act of planting the clock and surrendering the sparks is earned by prior ritual and memory. The contradiction between duty and tenderness is implied, not dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“hum of insight vibrating inside her skull like a tuning fork struck by moonlight”), but the philosopher’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation of the gear is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta and Jun show clear, embodied motives; the hound’s shift from mournful to willing guardian is earned through micro-choice (star-stamp touch). Interiority is concrete, though the collective “guides” remain slightly generic. Cost is visible: the hound’s self-chosen duty replaces leash-bondage.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bellhop’s interiority is embodied in tactile ritual (tracing the discoloration, turning the bolt) and crystallizes in the wordless promise to the boy; the contradiction between his vow of silence and his longing for song drives every beat. Motivation is anchored in the single, specific memory of his mother’s last lullaby, and the cost of enduring silence is felt in the tightening of his jaw and the frost on his lashes. The final act of remaining motionless is an earned renunciation that forecloses any future speech, sealing the price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The titan’s interiority—“precision, not revenge”—is crisp, embodied in micro-choices (ink droplet flick, marginalia placement). Contradictory impulses (mercy vs. duty) surface only in the final line, not mid-scene, so the earned renunciation feels slightly under-cooked. Still, the single POV holds, and the cost (forgetting the man’s face) is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—grief for the vanished reef and compulsion to follow the hidden path—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (tapping, prying the panel, descending). The final renunciation of “proof” for “remembering” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the sealed atlas page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—soles tasting dust, heart as second heartbeat—yet the “awkwardly confident” label is asserted rather than embodied; the final choice to ride sound into orbit is earned by the stone circle’s pulse and the shuttle’s awakening, so motivation coheres despite the slight label slip.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nara’s contradictory impulses—obedience to daughter’s last wish vs insurgent intent—are embodied in every micro-choice (limping cane, grafting knife nick). Her telepathy with plants is never label-speak; it manifests as tactical pressure (vine bloom, pollen nap). Final endurance—tucking altered embryo under her own heartbeat—forecloses council’s breeding path with visible cost (knees screaming, guard stirring). Interiority stays concrete, character-bound, and specific to her history.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is explicit—surviving a wedding drone strike—and the interior battle between memory and living is embodied in the “somatic map.” Micro-choice of pressing the rib to invoke Arbutus unedo reveals a precise coping grammar. The final “hand on the resin-sealed trunk” crystallizes earned renunciation; cost is felt: Nadia’s photograph leaves while the scar stays. Minor slip: “cling to life like…” simile momentarily abstracts rather than bodies the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s grief and artistic obsession are embodied in tactile micro-choices—touching the wall, cradling the card, stepping through the mirror—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The interior contradiction between preserving memory and surrendering to the sea is palpable, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses return. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the self-portrait is the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Albino tracker Kael's pink-eye gaze and "serene anger" create a lucid interior signature; his step into the ink portal finalizes a renunciation we've been prepped for (sister, mother, vocation). Interiority is embodied ("gloved finger," glow of skin), but sister Lyra remains schematic—only bootprints and oracle voice—so relationships stay more imagined than dramatic. Micro-choices (three ink drops, release of the vial) carry visible cost, though several rhetorical reaches ("consciously wild" twice) dilute specificity. Endure-and-enter is a credible, earned posture; the price is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sera’s conflicted motives and micro-choices (“felt the letter burn in her sleeve”) are embodied and specific; the moral calculus is dramatized, though a few beats lean on emotive labels.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—she both inherits her father’s eyes and rejects his path, a tension that drives every micro-choice. The final grafting act crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: the canvas fibers bite into her palms, thorns draw blood, and the hybrid rose becomes a living memorial that forecloses vengeance. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through her perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s cool composure is embodied in every micro-choice; the rail-spike act crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no stock phrasing—and her final “stay” choice is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the goddess’s dialogue edges toward label-speak (“echo you chase”), blunting full contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cordelia’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus agency—are dramatized in the rosewood-splintering moment; her micro-choices (loading the nib, pressing it till it breaks) visibly foreclose the old orbit and carry a felt cost. Interiority is concrete (“smelled of ink and thunder”) and embodied. The final renunciation earns its emotional weight because every beat has shown her testing the orbit’s grip. Minor slip: Dr. Orlan’s function is more facilitator than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“static crackled in her chest”), but the guilt-to-choice arc is slightly abstract; the final RELEASE is motivated yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning for permanence yet erasing her life’s work—drives every micro-choice; the final refusal to keep the mandala crystallizes this tension with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“lilac unease that would tint every future line”) anchors her arc without label-speak. The flaw of compulsive listening becomes the engine of change, not ornament. Earned stasis lands cleanly: she walks away lighter, pockets empty, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Asha’s contradictory impulses—her early absolutism vs. the mother’s burning-book mercy—are dramatized in the plaza’s tactile reconstruction; the renaming to “Iron Cradle” crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“feeling for the tell-tale edges”), and the final act of leaving the stone embodies the earned stasis. Minor: the leap from solitary cataloguer to itinerant teacher is asserted rather than dramatized, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ghost’s craving for an encore is embodied in every beat—his walk, coin press, thread tying—so motivation stays visceral. Interiority is ghost-specific (translucent ribs, frost soles) and never generic. The final bow under leaf-applause crystallizes an earned stasis: he accepts endless invisibility as cost for endless possibility. Only a hairline slip: Lila’s flicker between ages is slightly abstract, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s affectionate skepticism is embodied early and flips credibly when the geode’s warmth forces her to accept telepathic evidence; the final choice to illuminate healing pathways is earned by prior sensory overload and costs her detachment. Interiority stays concrete, but the shift from observer to empathic conduit is slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aera’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. to release) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation (voice given to the fossil) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of her own voice). No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Micro-choice hierarchy (pressing fossil to sternum) reveals value scale with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hourglass turner's interior contradiction—obedience to prophecy vs. will to re-sew it—drives every micro-choice (grouping buttons, uncorking the jar, pocketing two). Embodied emotion (boots crunching, feeling weight return) anchors motive without label-speak. The final renunciation of her tower role carries visible cost in the cracked glass she leaves behind. Voice and worldview remain distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The burned spy’s contradictory impulses—prudence versus daring—are embodied in the knee stab when he kneels to uncover the slate; the final renunciation of the pillbox and his scar “pulling tight as if smiling” crystallize a credible shift with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interiority is sparse but embodied—raw-knuckled hands, pulse-warmed seat—yet the decisive renunciation (tucking the sphere beneath his tongue) is earned by the palimpsest promise and the girl’s instruction. The shift from ferryman to solitary bearer is legible and costly, though the girl’s motives remain opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lin’s interiority is vivid—embodied pulse against apricot leaf, clay memory—but her decisive act (shaping the unfired hive) arrives more as mystical inevitability than earned contradiction under pressure; the cost is felt yet causally diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—rule-breaking caretaker vs. municipal-fine memorizer—are dramatized in every micro-choice; the final renunciation (dropping the tooth, staying till dawn) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—human mind inside extinct body—drives every choice; embodied emotion (trembling legs, muzzle on stone) anchors the arc. Micro-choice to place the sundial at center crystallizes the shift from communal memory to singular future with visible cost (memory split). Motivation remains coherent: translate isolation into independence. Minor: archivist’s hiss is generic, not character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulse—writing others’ longing while erasing her own—drives every beat; the spiral and bronze throat crystallize her renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, embodied (“second pulse”), and the final stance shift is earned by prior causality. Minor drift: the elderly woman and monks serve more as mirrors than crucible, so relationship pressure stays light.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—trembling fingers, terror masked by hope—and her micro-choice to risk permanent enmity by broadcasting interference is earned. Yet the cosmic tricksters remain off-stage abstractions, so relationship pressure is theoretical rather than crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s claustrophobia, prudence, and wistful rebellion are embodied in humming sea-shanties, compass-point rituals, and the final step into the circle; the cost—sealed tunnels—pays off her flaw-driven arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The artist’s face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied through tactile choices—mixing ribbon fibers into pigment, painting negative space—creating credible interior stakes. The final act of leaving the portrait and mask at the sheriff’s doorstep crystallizes her arc: she accepts her mind’s erasure of faces yet still delivers justice. The moment where she “forgives her own mind’s betrayal” is earned by the prior ritual of painting Elias. Cost is visible: she will forget the deputies’ faces even as she forces the town to remember.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—exile as escape vs. legacy as burden—are embodied in the copper nail and drive every micro-choice; the final renunciation to stay carries palpable cost. Interiority is concrete and specific; no stock phrasing. The thumbprint in verdigris crystallizes earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid—bow tension mirrors emotional stakes, glass flake pulses with memory—but the hitchhiker remains a cipher, so relationship crucible is absent. The decisive step onto the shadow-bridge is earned by layered micro-choices and embodied cost. No stock phrasing; voice stays specific to her father-haunted ear.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The son’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers brushing markers, the hush settling “over me”—and the final micro-choice (leaving the satchel half-open) crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Motivation remains consistent: he seeks the calm his father wielded, and every beat circles that need. The only drag is a brief lapse into diagnostic self-awareness (“I realized…”) that slightly dilutes embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers still smelling of ink”), but the chronicler’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized; the final renunciation (“I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled”) is earned yet the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Briar’s contradictory impulses—love for the enemy vs. guardianship of the trees—are dramatized through the seed’s bite and her kneeling confession; the cost is felt when the vine binds her arm, foreclosing retreat. Interiority is specific, embodied, and free of label-speak. Motivation tightens from avoidance to spoken guilt, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The root-bound visionary’s curiosity and scar-driven method create a credible interior arc; the final choice to tend the flower rather than possess it shows earned renunciation with visible cost (the city’s new pause). Interiority is concrete—‘anxious elation rose in me, a kite string pulled by two storms’—and embodied emotion anchors every beat. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies under pressure, though the gardener’s minimal on-page presence limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s “fiercely gentle” contradiction is dramatized in every gesture; the narrator’s surrender of the humming memory is embodied, costly, and irreversible. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final stance—holes left open for light—earns its renunciation through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the grille cloth vs. wanting to hurl it—play out in embodied micro-choices (folding, pocketing, taping it to the dash). The final pivot to the unpaid workshop is earned by the remembered moment of being needed, not applauded, so the path foreclosed (continued self-exile) carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and avoids therapy-speak; only the tiniest drift toward “purpose after loss” abstraction keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—methodical precision vs. grief-driven urgency—surface in embodied micro-choices (planting the seed, humming the lullaby) and culminate in an earned renunciation that redefines love as velocity. The interior contradiction is dramatized, not summarized, and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid—gears, creel, ribbon all externalize motive—but the librarian’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs release) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s fear of living rooms and her porous surrender to the cave’s sorrow are embodied in trembling breath and copper roots biting her temples; the crown’s acceptance is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interior contradiction pulses—she inspects tombs yet seeks forgiveness—driving every step. The mother’s cameo supplies motive without overt exposition. No secondary on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my hand froze on the coil”), contradictory impulses play out in real time, and the final renunciation of medication and embrace of memory carries visible cost. Backstory is woven through present stimuli and alters the stance via micro-choices (folding the map-boat). A hairline slip: the phrase “forgave the twelve-year-old” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied, but the veiled dreamer’s contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation (“I am happy” unsaid) is earned yet feels slightly abstract because the memory-price is shown only in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her telepathy, her mother’s lullaby, the off-key singing—all embodied and specific. Motivations (weighing dream vs empire) are dramatized through the fracture choice and final renunciation. The cost is felt: she vanishes, leaving only rumor and a puddle. Minor slip: “accidental telepathy” is asserted more than shown in action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath catch like a held note”), contradictions are present but not dramatized in-scene; the final dispersal is earned and costly, yet the sister/mother backstory is asserted rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caretaker’s contradictory impulses—fleeing upward yet yearning to heal the valley—are dramatized in her body (knees scalloping, palms sealed by sap). Her forgiveness is not declared but performed when she stabs the hairpin to anchor the boy, a micro-choice that fuses grief and agency. The final descent with the relic pulsing inside her shows a credible, earned endurance that forecloses escape and accepts cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, threadbare cloak of doubt, and final refusal of payment all reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. The micro-choice to offer the geologist the shard instead of absolution crystallizes her arc. Secondary characters remain functional but not fully individuated; the geologist’s silent gaze suffices for the scene’s crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reverse-aging is embodied through pitch-shifted voice and shrinking hands; her final vanishing is the earned culmination of withheld knowledge. Marcus’s desperation and dawning comprehension create a crucible relationship that forces his future choice. Interiority is concrete—iron in blood, stone’s weight—without diagnostic self-labeling. The cost of her vanishing is felt in Marcus’s future obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cael’s interiority is lyrically specific and embodied (“his teeth ache”), but the story leans on ancestral memory rather than on-page contradiction; the final stillness is earned yet the cost is more abstract than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his trembling fingers, frost-scarred knuckles, and the tear-blurred halos all reveal contradictory impulses (resignation vs. yearning) under pressure. The unstrapping of the bands is a micro-choice that visibly costs him status and safety, earning the final stance. Minor slip: the “underachieving” label is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Jin's interior contradiction—yearning to hear color yet fearing the cost of drowning—drives every beat; the moment he seals the safe and chooses ascent, the cost (leaving the luminous vows behind) is embodied in the plankton trail he carries. The salt-stained uniform of the vanished woman anchors his motivation in unspoken grief and inherited duty. No stock phrasing; each micro-choice (dive, breathe cautiously, seal the safe) reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (precision vs. doubt) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—becoming the carrier wave—earns its cost through prior causality and the tactile handling of coins. Minor slip: “stellar doubt” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—frost on tentacle, copper pooling in boots—yet the reaper’s contradictory self-loathing and reluctant guardianship of ghosts crystallize only in the final beats. The memory of the plague-cot girl is a sharp micro-choice that tilts the present stance. The earned renunciation—tearing the atlas, releasing paper souls—carries visible cost and forecloses his prior detachment. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is spare but consistent—his earnest naïveté and lukewarm magic drive every micro-choice (hanging the bell, counting drops, accepting lifelong vigil). The shift from hopeful experimenter to self-sacrificing keeper is credibly earned, with visible cost in his white beard and eventual death. Secondary characters exist only as communal chorus, so relationship crucible is absent, but the arc of devotion is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her flashlight slicing twilight, boots skidding on slime—yet the moment she pockets the label and later tears it into flakes crystallizes her contradictory impulses. The father’s Polaroid and her decision to photograph the town anew enact a credible renunciation with visible cost. One minor slip: “mirrored hush inside her chest” flirts with therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory: the alchemist’s pulse hummed against her own skepticism. Micro-choices (kneeling, chalk circle, touching the drop) reveal hierarchy of values. The final transformation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—she threads wonder into every future calculation. Only the “secretly sentimental” label is asserted rather than dramatized, a minor flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—muscle memory of the buckle, pulse against eardrums. Contradictory impulses (guard vs release) play out in real time; the final renunciation costs her the buckle and the vigil, earned by prior beats. Older self’s appearance is a touch convenient, but the momentary doubling crystallizes her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara/Zero’s split-soul duality is embodied in every gesture; the tremor in Zero’s wrist crystallizes shared fear. Interior contradiction pulses—“grief for the selves lost, joy for the love regained”—without therapy-speak. The final synthesis earns its cost by dissolving both parents into one body holding a laughing child.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (preserve sanctuary vs. let it mutate) act simultaneously in scene. The final smile at the backward-flowing brook crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost—she cedes authorship of her labyrinth. Micro-choices (prying glass, sprinting to levers) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Yet the fugue-state handwriting remains a convenient amnesia that blunts motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ellery’s grief is embodied in every tactile beat; the blower, the cord, the tunnel all externalize contradictory urges to resurrect and to let go. Interiority is specific and unflinching—no stock grief labels. The final kneel and whispered “Keep it safe” crystallize a costly renunciation that feels earned. Only the wife’s off-stage chuckle risks a sentimental shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific, but the guardian’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly alters tactics. The final “curling into snow” reads as stasis rather than earned renunciation, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“soot-blackened goggles,” “cold bloom of data where hope should have been”), but the alchemist’s contradictory impulses—faith vs. creative destruction—are stated more than dramatized until the final sacrifice of sight. The renunciation is earned and costly, yet the stoic sensitivity trait is asserted rather than tested in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“serenely electric pins mapped constellations across her skin”), but the arc leans on a single epiphanic pivot rather than a chain of micro-choices; the final renunciation is felt yet causally compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arden’s resilient optimism is embodied in concrete micro-choices—polishing brass, flipping the hourglass, steering by heartbeat Morse—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the final renunciation (pouring one timeline into another) carries visible cost: the hourglass crumbles to frost. The single POV remains coherent, and the moment of choice crystallizes his flaw-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Architect’s interiority is lyrically specific (“sinew thread pulsing with forgotten connections”) and embodied, but her choices remain largely observational; the final realization is asserted rather than dramatized through a decisive micro-choice, so the change feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The instructor’s grief-anchored motive and the boy’s trembling question create a crucible; her refusal to lie and the gift of the rusted link embody earned cost. Interiority stays concrete—rust in cut fingers, hollow in pocket—without therapy-speak. The final micro-choice (smile while imagining air) crystallizes a credible endurance that forecloses return for her yet opens it for the boy. Voice remains singular, no head-count clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “decades-old hearing aid tuned to the frequency of the dead” is a concrete, character-specific lens. The micro-choice to press the photograph against the wall crystallizes her values and drives the climax. The final silence of the aid is a credible, earned renunciation with visible cost. Only minor slip: the niece’s emergence is externally impelled, not forced by Mira’s flaw, so the relational crucible is one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is embodied in crawling basalt throat and trembling glove; her motive to “stand by the unremembered” drives every micro-choice, culminating in the costly act of naming each technician, which reverses their fate and rewrites her own fear into obligation. Interior contradiction—terror vs. duty—plays out in real time, not summary. The final renunciation of isolation carries visible cost as the gold lacquer transfers witness to her. No stock phrasing; voice stays specific and sensorily grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“soft mechanical tick inside my ribs”), contradictions live in scene (“refusal…to let the count reach zero”), and the final renunciation (leaving the clerk, stepping into the ring) is earned by prior micro-choices. The heartbeat count functions as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics. Minor slip: the clerk’s interiority is ventriloquised rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s fear-of-silence motive is vivid and embodied; her calcifying sacrifice is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete (“skin into drum”) and contradictory impulses (fear of curse vs fear of silence) act simultaneously. The final renunciation—one life for many voices—carries visible cost scaled to the length. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; voice remains singular.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vale’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to let go—are embodied in the arrowhead’s warmth and her rising feet; the final levitation crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Calla’s contradictory impulses—yearning to save beauty yet fearing the cost—are embodied in her arrhythmic heartbeat and the trembling bow. Micro-choices (skipping every fourth beat, kneeling to plunge fingers into glass) reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—walking away without looking back—earns its cost through prior causality and the visible loss of the locust-shell map. Interiority stays concrete; no stock labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the mailman’s “respectfully rebellious” stance is dramatized in every micro-choice. Motivation—forcing broken promises to bleed—escalates credibly to the final act of viral memory. The single cost (risking capture by releasing the storm) is felt on the page. Minor slip: Sal’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The carpenter’s erased-name anonymity and “memory of gears” root his interiority; the wooden horses’ nostril-flare response externalizes his long grief. His decision to kneel and sing memory rather than speak is earned by the prior image of swallowed words. The final footfall-notes crystallize a credible renunciation: he leaves carpentry for itinerant song, cost paid in the glow left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Calla’s contradictory impulses—guarding stories vs. releasing them—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, tearing the scarf). The final renunciation (letting the geometry fold away) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the scarf, acceptance of invisible guardianship).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mireya’s interior contradiction—hollowed by absence yet fiercely private—drives every beat; the palette’s crack and the camera’s empty film chamber crystallize her cost. Embodied emotion (“airy saturation”) anchors the final renunciation. No status dynamics on page, but single-POV arc is complete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith’s interior contradiction—his own fear once sewn shut—surfaces only in the final beat; until then he is a cipher whose motives are asserted (“asked no payment except a lock of hair”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The single micro-choice—offering his forehead to the trembling mouth—earns the closure, but the absence of any earlier visible flaw or cost keeps the arc just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. the safety of forgetting—are embodied in her trembling hand and the decisive scalpel cut. The final refusal to forget is earned by the prior realization that memories were surrendered, not stolen, and carries visible cost as the greenhouse shudders and the ring withers. Interiority is concrete, specific, and avoids diagnostic self-talk. The only minor slip is a brief “chronically curious” label that could be dramatized further.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulse—refusing to forget yet walking deeper into exile—drives every beat; her embodied fear (boots scuffing dust, shard-light scattering) and final wordless offer to the child crystallize a credible renunciation with visible cost. The mentor’s absence is felt as pressure, not exposition. Minor: the child’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s interiority is rich—tasting memory, seeing color bleed—but his contradictory impulses (hoard vs. share wonder) surface only in the final paragraph; earlier beats are more visionary than conflicted. The decisive renunciation (letting color travel) is earned and carries visible cost (loom collapses, he ages), yet the emotional layering could be sharper under pressure. Secondary characters are off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, a vivid single-POV portrait with minor under-use of internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirel’s interior contradiction—restorer vs liberator—drives every beat; the final renunciation is earned by the needle’s tactile choices and the fox’s warmth. Embodied emotion (“heartbeat…muffled knock”) grounds stakes. Minor: the mentor’s suicide is told, not dramatized, slightly blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s methodical curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—threading film, aligning horizons, pressing palm to parchment—each tightening her stance toward silence. Interiority is precise and character-specific; her mentor’s axiom is recalled only when the map pulses, grounding reflection in present stimulus. The final renunciation—mapping with room for mystery—costs her the mastery she once sought and is earned by the empathic silence she endures inside the henge. One slip: the phrase “shielded openness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s grief-driven quest is embodied in every micro-choice—photographing the journal, sealing the dog tags—yet the interior contradiction between clinging and releasing is stated more than dramatized. The final renunciation is earned and costly, but Fred remains an observer, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—preserve vs. release—drives every beat; the trembling cerulean smear embodies cost. The echo-encounter crystallizes her shift from hoarder to broadcaster, paid for by the empty bolt plate. Motive stays legible under lyric compression; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “tasting metal” is generic embodiment amid otherwise precise somatics.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s curiosity is vividly embodied—she polishes the goggles, traces the cipher, hums the staff—so her shift from obedient servant to clandestine planter feels inevitable. The final renunciation (staying below) carries visible cost: she forfeits status, warmth, safety. One hairline slip: the duke’s-son chord is more symbol than crucible; it doesn’t force her hand, merely echoes it.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fear of forgetting and her quiet resolve are shown through tactile handling of the telescope and the kites. The generational grief and scientific obsession interlock credibly, and her final renunciation (stepping out) is earned by the prior stakes. Minor slip: the mother’s theory is summarized more than dramatized, blunting the emotional crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the face-blind artist’s perceptual world is rendered through tactile, synesthetic detail. Motivation crystallizes in the micro-choice to paint absence rather than likeness, foreclosing recognition as refuge. The flaw (prosopagnosia) is not merely stated but weaponized into a filter that shapes every stroke. Cost is felt in the final renunciation of the painted sky itself.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning for discovery while fearing the ship’s death—drives every micro-choice; the moment she kneels to trace spirals embodies both curiosity and desperation. The final act of reading aloud crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she trades private grief for communal light. Relationships remain off-stage, but her isolation is credibly embodied and then dissolved through the shared glow.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s interior contradiction—yearning to mend cosmic rhythms while nursing a stalled heart—drives every micro-choice; the healed eclipse-key crystallizes his earned shift from apprentice to custodian with visible cost (door vanishes, mentor’s realm claims him). Mentor loss is backstory but is dramatized through the key’s fracture and repair, so BRR is met. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s altruism is embodied in every beat—chilling dew into letters, counterbalancing ladders—yet her interior contradiction (ghostly detachment vs. need for human trust) remains abstract; the final renunciation is earned but cost is diffuse rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The adjuster’s contradictory impulses—duty vs. mercy—are embodied in the trembling hand and cracked lullaby; her final renunciation is earned by the recursive cradle memory and costs her eternity of whispering, visible in “body eroding like sandstone.” Interiority is concrete, never abstract; the puppet recognition anchors motive without exposition. Micro-choice to kiss the splintered forehead crystallizes value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is character-particular and embodied (“sap that formed faces… mouths open in silent accusation”); the nut-contradiction under tongue drives the final choice. Causality for the graceless duty is clear, and the earned stasis—continued imprisonment in the orchard—carries visible cost. One missing micro-choice (why she never questions or tests the curse) keeps it from 9+. Relationships as crucible not applicable; solo POV.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her polymer lens on grief, the tactile chrysalis, the radial artery pulse—yet the final renunciation (walking away) feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is visible but the internal contradiction driving it is not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The clean-slate vendor’s choices feel causal—her purchase with absence, the door image, and her last act of letting the outline step through all reconfigure stakes. Still, some motivation remains abstruse; the late reveal of her own door makes her a passenger in the close.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s contradictory impulse—using her curse to heal rather than absorb—drives every beat; the reversal from taking to giving memories is embodied in the coral-floor kneel and costs her the safety of emotional distance. Interiority stays sensory and chef-specific (“tasting memory like recipes”). Final renunciation (she walks away changed) is earned and carries visible cost: her gift no longer shields her.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mireya’s empathetic decisiveness is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—cradling the lead cone, braiding languages, rehanging the weight—each with felt cost; the final exhaustion and “bridge is a song” line crystallize her arc without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. chaotic seizure—are embodied in the wrench-twitching calibration and the blood-threaded removal of the helmet. Her micro-choices (angle adjustment, vial drop, mirror tear) visibly alter stakes and foreclose the intact-extraction path. The final smile and pocket sketches show earned cost and forward compulsion without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ilyra’s prism-minded perception and thirty-year obsession are concrete, but her final “third option” feels abstract rather than a visible choice; the interior contradiction is present yet never embodied in a micro-action that costs her something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilay’s motivation (“to create music in a silent world”) is explicit yet embodied through tactile micro-choices—mapping cracks, matching heartbeats, strumming fissures. The interior contradiction (urgency vs. arboreal patience) plays out in scene, and the final bow signals earned renunciation with visible cost (trembling knees). No secondary character pressure, but single-POV depth suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tutor’s interiority is rich—thumb in the stone’s dent, translating silence into chess notation—but the “final student who mattered more” never appears on stage, so the decisive change lacks an embodied cost. His contradictory impulses (guilt vs. vocation) are present yet resolve too smoothly into hopeful certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirelle’s pacifist ethic is embodied in her refusal to force the lock; her interiority (“empathy is sympathetic resonance”) is concrete and character-specific. The embodied cost—she becomes the diary’s echo—earns the final choice. Minor slip: the velvet-patch detail is decorative rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Myrrh’s olfactory sensitivity and ambition are embodied in every beat—testing the seed, stitching it, breathing through her mouth. The internal shift from ambition to gratitude is earned by the tree’s stillness and her mother’s passing breath. Micro-choices (folding the doodle, piercing bark) reveal hierarchy of values. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV interiority is precise and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aera’s contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. inherited duty—are embodied in her tactile reading of water currents and her surrender of memories to the sapling. The arrow-tip exchange crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she relinquishes private grief to become conduit. Interiority is specific, sensory, and never lapses into label-speak. Only a slight safety-hedge in the final orchard tableau keeps her from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    The investigator embodies competence but lacks full interior contradiction; her decisions serve the plot more than a revealed internal fault. No opposing motive surfaces under pressure, and her arc settles at a tidy competence-carrying rather than earned stasis with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell ringer’s synesthetic perception and micro-choices (touching the amber sheet, reading glyphs with her skin, striking through aurora) are embodied and character-specific. Interiority remains coherent, and the final renunciation—never ringing another bell—carries felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—driven keeper vs. stillness-seeker—are embodied in micro-choices (uncasing, breathing silence, laying flute). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of flute, guardianship, identity). Interiority is concrete, embodied, and avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Quince’s contradictory impulses—his need to quantify grief versus the unquantifiable cost of empathy—are dramatized in the press reversal; the final self-printing is earned by the erosion of every borrowed soul, leaving a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “jittery” trait is shown through clutching the pendant and racing pulse, but the interior contradiction is thin; the final acceptance feels inherited from Corwin rather than wrested under pressure. The woman’s centuries-heavy voice is asserted, not embodied. Still, the courier’s micro-choices (pausing, surrendering the pendant) track with motive and cost is felt when he loses the artifact and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s contradictory impulses—scientific proof vs. grief—are embodied in the prism’s warmth and the fracture that mirrors his own; the final renunciation (“Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush”) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The spinner’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “remembered the orchard before her mind did,” her muteness is embodied in “lungs working like bellows with no sound,” and her final endurance is earned by prior causality. The contradiction between preserving memory and surrendering voice is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The only slight drag is the abstract “impossible distance” phrase that edges toward label-speak, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Corin’s interiority is embodied and stakes-aligned; the “meek” label is shown through early hesitation then overturned by embodied resolve. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. defiance) coexist in-scene, and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost (loss of silk, risk of collapse). Minor slip: “meek” is asserted once rather than fully dramatized before the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the map-maker’s sensory obsession and guilt are palpable. Her contradictory impulse—charting absence while weaponizing knowledge—drives the climax. The final renunciation (“chart consequences”) is earned by the prior revelation of complicity. Minor: younger-self cameo is more tableau than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence, embodied in his wordless stone-glass replies, drives every beat; the bottled sea-glass act crystallizes a lifetime of silent obligation with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“porcelain echo that sliced the salt air”), her contradictory impulse to steer night yet birth dawn crystallizes in the black-flame choice, and the final renunciation (walking inland as reader not herald) carries felt cost. Motivation is ancient-geas rather than personal, but the text roots it in her laugh and the lens, so agency remains legible. No relationship crucible on page, yet single-POV pressure suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-erasure—are embodied in the borrowed heartbeat and the wing’s pull. Micro-choices (climbing, lunging for the wing, knotting thread) reveal a hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of anonymity carries visible cost: he accepts the donor’s public vocation. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her split thumbnail healed by moonlight, her whispered apology to the astronomer—but the final shift from maintenance worker to quiet listener feels slightly under-motivated; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the parapet. The embodied sorrow and tactile handling of the sextant show clear micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical yet grounded in embodied action; the keeper’s micro-choices (pressing mica, singing, driving shards into ribs) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of her name is earned by prior pain and memory recovery. Minor slip: “bound release” is asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—fleeing yet arriving, hiding yet surrendering—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (kneeling, smoothing the invitation, dissolving). Interiority is embodied (“heartbeat of marble,” “tasting latent emotions”), and the final renunciation carries visible cost as she forfeits corporeal existence. The empathic trait is not merely labeled but weaponized into the library’s new guardian. A hairline slip: the “mis-delivery” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly blunting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mila’s vocation and perceptual quirks are vivid, but the interior contradiction between fear of complicity and hunger for restoration stays summary; the final “tears salting the crust” lands because prior tactile care with the loaf earned it, yet the gardener remains a functional oracle rather than a second pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“pulse falter,” “determination crystallized”), but the mentor backstory is delivered in one reflective block that tilts the present stance only once; still, the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The daughter’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory wish for her father to stop her versus her resolve to betray him is embodied in the half-moon dents the fob leaves in her palm. Motive escalates cleanly from filial loyalty to a need to test that loyalty’s corrosion. The final renunciation (handing over the fob) is earned and carries visible cost. Only the father remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—taste of ozone, ring’s pulse—but her decisive shift from skeptic to “recognizer” is asserted rather than dramatized; the cost is implied, not felt. No secondary pressure from on-page relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Artist’s interior contradiction—gift as curse, desire to hide vs. need to remember—drives every micro-choice; the moment she “paints faster, no longer restoring but collaborating,” the fused self-portrait crystallizes her earned change with tangible cost (charcoal to dawn).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning for candor while fearing she has become an echo—drives every beat; the moment she admits “I’m afraid I’ve forgotten how to listen” crystallizes motive under pressure. The final choice to read the unsent letters costs her the illusion that truth had vanished with the water, yet the prose never externalizes this as tidy growth. Micro-choices (inserting the plate, answering the greenhouse) align with her wilt-near-dishonesty trait, but the emotional cost is more asserted than embodied in body or breath. Still, the arc lands as credible renunciation: she trades passive nostalgia for active guardianship of withheld speech.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied (“fingertips reading micro-oscillations”); the mute-season choice is a credible renunciation with felt cost. No contradictory impulses in-scene, and the final wordless gift to the boy crystallizes her arc without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    K-17’s contradictory caretaker/nostalgic impulses are embodied in the merging box and final rooting; the micro-choice to open the box and accept the burn reconfigures its identity with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“servos hummed with memory fragments”). The arc earns renunciation of pure order for fused memory-machine existence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s curator identity and “built her life on listening” anchor every choice; her refusal to open the box crystallizes an earned renunciation that costs her the certainty of proof, satisfying Earned Stasis. Interiority is concrete (“settled like dust between her ribs”), and micro-choices (borrowing borescope, sitting without tools) track escalating stakes. The final click inside her chest externalizes the cost without therapy-speak. No relationship crucible on page, so cap at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—vulnerability as both lock and hinge—are embodied in every pirouette and swallowing of the seed; the final bodily encryption is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mael’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory pull between reclaiming memory and fear of its cost is embodied in every micro-choice (feeding the matchbook to the projection). The final renunciation—accepting the whale’s breath as her mother’s lost name—carries visible cost and is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the summoner’s contradictory impulses (to speak vs. to hush) are dramatized through micro-choices like pressing the wing to his sternum. Motivation is rooted in past trauma yet intensifies under present pressure. The final swallowing of the sphere is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor: no second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“steam rose like incense between us”), yet the climactic acceptance of the tutor’s mantle feels slightly under-motivated; the shift from learner to keeper happens in a single beat without prior micro-choices that foreclose other paths. The tutor’s transparency is poignant, but her agency is mostly expository rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between public skeptic and private believer is dramatized through her trembling grip on the shell. The final renunciation—color for memory—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by the garden’s chromatic drain. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she admitted she wanted…”) mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—master forger vs. penitent survivor—drives every beat; the embodied cost of pressing the thorn into her own palm crystallizes the arc. Motivation is rooted in sister-loyalty and guilt, intensifying to the final blood-written confession. The earned renunciation (leaving the thorn, walking away) forecloses vengeance with visible cost. Only a trace of diagnostic self-label (“became the monster”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory need to both hear and silence echoes is embodied in every beat; the final choice to finish her mother’s farewell is earned by the blood-memory gift that first felt like curse. Interiority stays concrete—“taste the iron in a stranger’s blood memory”—and the mother-daughter recognition lands with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase “richly perceptive” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied edge.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marrow’s interiority is vivid—her cautious weaving of truth is dramatized in every beat, from the cold-burning candles to the second heart she accepts. The contradictions (listening to ghosts yet guarding herself) are embodied, not labeled. Final renunciation—leaving the mirror—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lyrical but remains character-specific; the bamboo whisk and calloused fingers anchor embodied knowledge. Motive—"to appreciate hidden effort"—is stated early and re-asserted through ritual action, yet the final renunciation (stepping onto shadow) feels slightly abstract; cost is poetic rather than visceral. Still, her micro-choices (whisking air, whistling) track a coherent arc from observation to participation in the pattern she studies.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s shift from debunker to truth-hunter is embodied in her tactile handling of the diamond and the deliberate burial of the letters; the cost—shame and copper-taste—is visceral. Interior contradiction pulses when she almost drops the stone, yet her earlier motivation (“excavate truth…even if the shovel cut her own hands”) justifies the final renunciation. The flaw is that her past self appears only as playback, not as active memory she must refute, blurring the internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, cobalt glass hum, and radio ghosts anchor her loneliness and mission. The contradiction between preserving memory and birthing a new world is dramatized through her song back to the prophet. However, the prophet’s hidden doubt arrives late and is told rather than embodied, softening the cost of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Posy’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the past while laboring to release it—surface in the embodied act of bottling sounds and pouring them into the box; the final renunciation of “currency” for invitation carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her refusal to spend the pennies on bread.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mireya’s interiority is vivid—her heartbeat syncing to centuries of ice, her tears tasting of whale song—yet the “logically emotional” trait is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final renunciation (save artifact without destroying town) is earned by the sonic calculus she performs, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—impatience vs. the discipline to wait—is embodied in every beat; the final crystallization of “impatience finally cool into a smooth, dark stone” shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (touching rail, breathing on pouch) reveal hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing; perceptual signature is precise and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her grip on the lantern, the memory of her father’s screams, the tremor when she recognizes her father’s shadow in Park’s journal. The contradiction between her watchful calm and the memory-train that “hits like a train” is dramatized, not labeled. The final micro-choice—walking back with the lantern as “small rebellion”—earns a credible shift in stance and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emil’s guilt-driven mission is vivid, embodied in the ticking heart he turns “between gloved fingers.” The contradiction between faith and bureaucratic complicity is alive in scene, not summary. Micro-choice—paying with the candle fund—makes the cost visible. Yet Rowan remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Juniper’s “steadily curious” smirk and brass monocle give her a distinct perceptual signature; the arrow-tip stylus embodies her irreverent awe. Internal contradiction surfaces when she laughs at the bell’s impossibility yet commits fully to translating it, paying with the dulled arrow and a ringing no one else can yet hear. The single on-page character satisfies scope; her micro-choices (etching, lashing, striking) escalate stakes and foreclose retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The keeper’s interiority fuses with the final choice—loss of self vs. refusal to forget—expressed in the hummed lullaby sung at cost. Micro-choices accumulate: finger on crystal, badge pixelation, job evaporating in real time. Embodied contradiction: she sacrifices her paid role as keeper to become a living archive, a clear Earned Stasis under Causal lens. Her mother’s erased presence is not revealed as abstract trauma but felt in the hologram wave that washes over her own identity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—empathy vs. the Council’s refusal—are dramatized in the shard-burn and mirror choice; the final haul is earned by prior causality and costs his safety. Interiority is embodied (coat drinking moonlight, palms branded by lead line). The relationship with Sira is the crucible that forces the rescue. Flaws (hesitation, theft of shard) complicate the act and remain unresolved, charging the orchard treaty image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—spectator vs participant—drives every beat; the parasol tip handed to the boy crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost (she forfeits her heirloom and her original plan). Interiority is embodied and specific (“fold in patience…balanced like a question mark”). Secondary characters (boy, elders) exert immediate pressure that alters her stance. The final choice to stay and listen rather than leave is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the burned letter fragment acts as a tactile anchor for contradictory impulses. The final realization—“some grapes, like some loves, could only express their true nature through struggle”—earns its cost through thirty-seven years of embodied labor. The lone sentinel motif is sustained without cliché, and his micro-choice to graft new “impossible” vines crystallizes a stance with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase “intersubjective understanding” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The half-masked line walker’s interiority is richly textured—his scar, the memory of past failure, the disciplined refusal to look directly at wisdom—but the piece leans on lyrical summary rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. His single decisive act (consecrating the clearing) is filtered through poetic distance, muting the cost on the page. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Archivist’s interiority is embodied and specific—“fingers tasting every crack,” “purple with blossoms”—but her decisive micro-choice (pressing the key into the photo) arrives with only faint prior causality; the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Still, the contradiction between whimsy and grief is dramatized in action, not summary, and the final shared exhale shows earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s reticence is embodied in her quiet movements and refusal to grandstand, but her interiority stays largely abstract—“weathered innocence” is asserted rather than dramatized. The decisive micro-choice to testify rather than catalogue is credible, yet the cost (renouncing her life-long stance of detached observation) is stated more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the chalk-marked palm and tape-scent ground the prophet’s precognitive amnesia in sensory detail. Contradictory impulses—clinging to memory while embracing forgetting—play out in the spiral-drawing ritual. The final renunciation (“marking mattered more than the mark”) is earned by the prior search and carries visible cost. Only the driftwood markers feel slightly external to his psyche, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid yet drifts toward poetic therapy-speak near the end; the final smile lands because the cost has been dramatized, but the motivation to “restructure herself” feels asserted rather than deeply forged in causal micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her “decisively kind” stance masks private grief; the vinyl shard’s scent triggers micro-choices that alter Calderon’s dying moment and her own closure. The cost—carrying both broken halves forward—earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s quietly deliberate nature is embodied in her tactile, methodical handling of the key and the automaton; the moment she trades her own wandering shadow to anchor everyone else’s crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is sparse but precise, and the final whispered rune shows a micro-choice that seals her transformation. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. the tooth’s proof—drives every beat; her micro-choice to place the tooth into the constellation jaw crystallizes her arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses—fear of isolation vs. desire to share light—collide in the pearl’s dissolution. The cost is felt in the “exact heft of a sigh” and the dulling of the glass. Motivation tightens from memory to action without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—“wound inside her had begun to taste like metal”—and her micro-choice to plant the second confession beneath the server is earned by prior causality. The contradictory impulse between public exposure and private healing is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Secondary pressure from Elias is minimal but cleanly legible; the final renunciation of labels carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—cynicism vs. need to rescue her own creations—drives every beat; the final surrender of the shell shows earned cost. Yet the refugee boy and pianist are sketched more as emblems than full agents, capping intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s grief for her daughter and her seventeen-year vigil give the stakes visceral weight; her micro-choices (tracing the tendril, modulating song pitch) reveal interior stakes. The shift from cracked voice to full-throated song embodies earned confidence. Yet the daughter remains off-page, blunting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—rime on lashes, sulfur-frost fingers—but the final renunciation (“relinquishment”) is asserted more than dramatized; we feel the cost conceptually rather than viscerally. Contradictory impulses (cartographer of war vs. life) are present yet compressed into reflection rather than live tension. Still, the character’s micro-choices (kneeling, arranging spiral, folding heart) align with motive and foreclose the path cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ansel’s interior contradiction (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”) is staged, embodied, and paid in the final cost of locking the silver-faced clock away. His micro-choices—studying angles, dismantling the timer, reassembling backward—tighten consistently; the moment he presses a gear “backward until it clicked into an earlier state” crystallizes the Earned Renunciation. Motive scales from curiosity to stewardship with visible toll (the lost hours dissolve against his coat). Only minor slip: emotional articulation edges toward lyric abstraction (“tailored skin”) near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The weaver’s interior contradiction—collector of others’ grief who refuses her own—drives every beat; the sister-memory cuts her finger and re-weights the lattice, paying the visible cost that earns release. No stock labels; every emotion is embodied in antler-loom, amber thread, violet flare. Final renunciation (leaving the lamp) is causally tied to the confession; flaw becomes the price of valley-saving. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory while forging new form—are embodied in every tactile micro-choice; the carving’s progression externalizes her refusal to blink first, culminating in an earned renunciation that costs her the illusion of containment.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“I pocket whatever frame feels heaviest”), but the scavenger’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized; the final swap feels inevitable yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s curiosity and engineering mindset drive every beat; her tactile rerouting of valves and soldering of the beacon crystallize her arc. The child’s laugh as datum zero shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and specific to her profession. No secondary character applies pressure, but Mara’s solitary choices foreclose paths cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the cracked-gear guilt and the seed-as-ending crystallize her arc. The micro-choice to release the dream is earned and costly. Minor drift: “excruciatingly gentle” repeats without fresh embodiment in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth yet fearing its cost—are embodied in her tactile handling of the sundial and the journals; her final resolve to dismantle lies is earned through prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (abandoning the sundial, embracing lifelong labor). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only minor slip: Captain Riga remains functional rather than crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ari’s patience, embodied in tactile micro-choices (warming the fulgurite knot, cracking the bead), drives every beat; the final planting is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the last seed, exile from the dock). Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. The single contradiction—risking the seed to save the method—charges the climax. Status tension with the harbormaster is brief but sharp, forcing the decisive retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“ink-stained fingers trembling”), motives deepen as the thread’s true nature is revealed, and the final self-recognition is earned by prior causality. Micro-choice of planting the last inch of thread crystallizes her transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prince’s contradictory impulses—yearning for beauty while grave-robbing and soldering—are embodied in trembling fingers and whispered apologies. Motivation intensifies from nostalgic ache to active resurrection, culminating in a smile that accepts falling as genesis. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into therapy-speak. The final renunciation (letting the palace fall) carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—rage against her father and the need to redeem his legacy—are embodied in every gesture; the grafting of black sand and the coin’s placement crystallize her internal split. Micro-choices (tamping soil, tying the drachma) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final salute is a credible renunciation that carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—skeptic yet compelled to test the impossible—drives every beat; her embodied grief (hands on warm glass, knees at dry basins) and micro-choice to speak to the box anchor her arc. The final renunciation of the empty box costs her the comfort of denial, a felt forfeiture scaled to the piece. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority is specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—rooted sorrow vs. transmission—are dramatized in real time through the gear’s tuning and the final choice to leave it behind; the embodied ache and micro-choice to kneel and press the gear against the beacon crystallize motive with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choices (ribbon press, chisel tap) reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—softness vs. stone—act simultaneously under pressure. The final renunciation (no name on the gravestone) is earned by prior causality and carries visible communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; the brother’s ghost and the ticking debt create layered, contradictory impulses. The final act—carving the “r” and lashing the rake handle—earns its cost through prior causality. Ethical diligence is dramatized as a visible trade-off, not a label. Minor slip: the villagers remain off-page, so status dynamics are inferred rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mercy’s curiosity and tenderness are embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing the coin, climbing the ladder, pressing it into the tin door—culminating in her acceptance of keeperhood. The spiral cipher and seed packets externalize her internal contradiction between caretaker and inheritor, and the final descent carries visible cost: she seals herself from the surface world. A hairline slip: “uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs” flirts with diagnostic label-speak, but the surrounding embodiment rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartographer’s interiority is vivid—her willingness to trade memory for futures is embodied in the frostbitten fingertip and the dissolving quill. The internal contradiction (surrender vs. authorship) is dramatized in the act of writing mid-air at the cost of self-erasure. The final renunciation—becoming the blank page—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Only the “groundedly imaginative” trait remains slightly abstract, never quite constraining an on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mila’s interior contradiction—yearning vs. enforced silence—is embodied in the rosin-ink ritual; her micro-choice to transmit at solstice crystallizes the arc with visible cost (lost anonymity, Ministry inhalation). Traits shape speech and worldview; no stock labels. The Earned Stasis—she keeps copying amid fallout—feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven preservation vs. the need to pulverize memory—are embodied in every micro-choice (grinding porcelain, aligning sight-lines). The final scattering renounces the comfort of narrative completion, costing her the last intact shard of her grandmother’s face; the mask’s fit against her cheekbones crystallizes this price.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Caldera’s refusal of vaccines, ledger-diving, and final public utterance all spring from a coherent, embodied drive; the femur-stylus beat crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Interior contradiction—rational rebellion vs. macabre practicality—plays out in concrete micro-choices. No headcount issues; single-POV interiority stays specific and pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—rage braided with self-sacrifice—is embodied in the act of singing into the rosette; the final renunciation of her own voice carries visible cost. Motivation remains consistent: she applies to the library precisely because she can no longer speak except in questions, and her grandmother’s legacy compels the subtraction method. The micro-choice to kneel and press her ear to the crumbling wood crystallizes a hierarchy of values: communal healing over personal song. Flawed struggle is present—she must “unlearn hatred” by first hearing her own rage—yet the arc feels slightly abstract because the external world reacts off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tasting memories, pruning the past, feeding the sprout her blood—each choice rooted in her trait of informal wisdom and escalating the stakes. The final renunciation (stealing the next seed) crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Minor slip: “informally wise” is stated rather than dramatized once.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—truth-cursed yet forced to lie—drives every beat; the wax reanimation and coin-orbit visibly cost her the safety of routine, earning her renunciation of the toll. Embodied tension in “her truthful tongue tasted sulfur” and “coins…orbit her like copper bees” keeps emotion physical. Flaw: the boy’s abrupt exit leaves his pressure on Mara inferred rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mireille’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to intervene vs. merely notice) play out in micro-choices like pressing the orris shard or displacing her shoe. The final renunciation—leaving without possession—earns its cost through prior ritual and felt disappointment in the chairs. Minor slip: “inadvertently profound” flirts with label-speak yet is dramatized by the objects’ choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied ("felt thought bloom inside my mineral skull like warm ink"), but the statue’s final choice to break the ampoule is more asserted than earned; no prior beat shows internal conflict crystallizing into this specific act. The gardener’s presence is braided rather than dramatized, so the statue’s motivation feels second-hand. Still, the softening of stone into “possibility” is a credible change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grim optimism is embodied in every micro-choice—counting primes, rolling dice, smearing blood—so motive stays kinetic. Interiority is concrete (“ghost-weight of a hand”) and contradictory (panic vs. resolve). The final refusal to step through the ripple is earned by the entire texture of climbing; cost is the blood-smeared steps that keep turning. Only the “mathematician” backstory is slightly abstract, not dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s insomnia, hope, and artistic compulsion are embodied in tactile choices—mixing indigo, breathing the mural alive—culminating in earned exhaustion that forecloses further sleepless nights. The arrival of Jules crystallizes her private act into communal gift, showing relational stakes without headcount clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelia’s interiority is textured—her bread-ritual, emerald lens, and “rescue is resonance” stance all grow from a coherent motive. Micro-choices (fitting the lens into the lute, stepping forward flour-dusted) visibly cost her social safety and anchor the ending. The shift from savior to stage-provider is earned and embodied. Minor: Milo’s shiver-recovery feels slightly expedient.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The clock-maker’s contradictory impulses—yearning to outrun death yet relinquishing his gift—are embodied in every tactile choice; the final renunciation costs him his art and lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the whispering advisor and the gray child are distinct projections of the narrator’s psyche. Motivation—tricking fear by exposing its own weakness—drives every beat. The final kneel and clasp transfer is earned, with visible cost (mirrors collapse, advisor silenced). Minor slip: “diagnostic label-speak” in “fear had a throat” almost tips into therapy-speak but is saved by visceral follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prophet’s interiority is embodied in tactile sound-making and micro-choices; his conversion motive intensifies through escalating pressure. No contradictory impulses on the page, yet the final stance crystallizes with visible cost—the raft’s survival becomes his renunciation of silence. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A. Single POV holds clean.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied ("ink-stained thumb," "pulse hammered against her coral collar"), motives escalate from curiosity to irreversible choice; final renunciation carries visible cost as she drops the whistle and accepts exile from the known map.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—seduction by the letter’s beauty versus duty to truth—are dramatized in the tactile moment she “almost understood” Rowan’s lie, then tucks the letter away. The embodied cost is her leap across the platform, shedding inherited glory like the bare rosebush. Interiority stays specific to her historian’s perceptual lens. One minor slip: “心跳 counting options” momentarily breaks POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—stoic recorder vs. mourning archaeologist—drives every micro-choice; the ink-drop offering and palm-to-stone beat embody the cost of her renunciation. Motive intensifies from diagnostic fatigue to elegiac mission, culminating in the sealed confessions that foreclose return. No secondary characters dilute the crucible; her flaws and limits remain consistent, earning the final walk-away.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses—obedience to Council vs hunger for erased truth—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (wrist stamp, card reordering). The final renunciation to “remember” carries visible cost: she pockets the stamp and leaves the only place that still holds the evidence, locking herself into future danger.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern-maker’s grief is embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing a tea leaf “out of habit,” breathing the dream into her lungs—yet the interior contradiction between holding and releasing her daughter never fully collides in a single beat; the final renunciation is felt but causally under-lit.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The survivor’s grief-driven compulsion to harvest “unused potential” is embodied and escalating; every micro-choice (smashing breakers, leaping) is rooted in the same wound. Interiority stays concrete and particular—no therapy-speak. The final renunciation (choosing to become the perturbation that redirects the drone) is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible cost: his life. Flaw: the bride’s late appearance is more symbol than crucible, slightly blunting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her racing heart, the drone’s camera-eye, the folded star-map at her chest—but the pilgrim remains a cipher; his “perpetually surprised eyes” label rather than reveal. The decisive pull of the lever is earned by her lifelong search, yet the cost feels light: she gains belonging without visible loss. Secondary pressure from the pilgrim is present but diffuse; he guides rather than opposes. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with minor depth gaps in the relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt and self-loathing are viscerally embodied; every tactile beat (pitch-black palms, sagging pockets, copper-tasting powder) sharpens her interior contradiction. The micro-choice to carve false memories into driftwood crystallizes her need to offload weight, and the final renunciation—threading shells onto the watch hand—earns its cost by exposing the brother-shaped void. Interiority stays specific and un-diagnostic; no stock phrases intrude. The only limit is that the brother’s death is backstory, not an on-page relationship, so the relational crucible bullet is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—regret for his brother versus duty to protocol—are embodied in the brass pull and the moon calendar; the final renunciation of the pull carries visible cost as he “descended…pocket lighter…heart fuller.” Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Micro-choices (offering gloves, timing the pause, humming the lullaby) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The only minor slip is the near-therapeutic phrasing “recycle mistakes into wisdom,” but it is offset by immediate dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's inner contradiction—navigator stripped of maps—drives every on-the-water choice; her shift from chart-obedience to marrow-steering feels fully earned. Micro-turns (paddle toward shoals, laughter at the gash) show traits in action, and her emotional spiral is embodied rather than labeled. No second character, so relationship pressure bullet not applicable. Internal beats crystallize the price paid in self-forfeiture of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    The seeker’s contradictory impulses—hunger for erasure vs. need to own his cruelty—are dramatized in every beat; the lake baptism crystallizes a credible, costly shift from hollow to accountable. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choices (stealing coat, diagonal steps, wading) externalize the hierarchy of values with visible price. The cracked baseball on the sill is earned stasis: he can’t go back, can’t stay pure, and we feel the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sister-phoenix bond is vividly embodied; the narrator’s micro-choices (cutting palms, inhaling spices, stepping into the circle) all flow from a single, escalating motive. Interiority is concrete, contradictory (fighting the change while courting it), and culminates in a costly fusion. Minor drift: the “beast whisperer” label is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the cartomancer’s contradictory impulses (to grieve yet re-enter time) are dramatized in the saucer-crack canyon scene. The final renunciation—leaving the healed saucer in the glade—pays the cost of perpetual remembrance. Minor: the “willingly perplexed” label is asserted more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Halcyon’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—threading photos with her own hair, refusing hologram warnings—culminating in the costly renunciation of escape. The contradiction between joy and grief is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Her final Earned Stasis (choosing to stay and tend the archive) is fully earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the hatch seals behind her.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradictory impulses of clinging to memories versus releasing them play out in real-time kneeling and releasing fireflies. Motivation is consistent and deepened by each micro-choice. The final renunciation of physical self to become “skeleton of light” carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by every prior act. Only minor drift into cosmic abstraction at the end keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Garnet’s contradictory obedience-to-rebellion arc is embodied in tactile micro-choices (thumb on quill, graphite coaxing pins). The cradle-of-sparks metaphor externalizes her internal conflict and drives every beat. Final mask-drop crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost: identity and career foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his helpless foresight and active surrender charges the final beat. The sister’s death and promise anchor motive, but her absence keeps relationship pressure abstract. The moment he touches the dissolving eel crystallizes cost, yet the prior beats lean more on lyric than on micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s interiority is embodied and specific—her scalpel-opening of the envelope, the shoulder scar as map, the act of writing in fixer all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation is rooted in the need to reclaim censored language, and the final choice to burn the map-plane and etch new words onto stone carries visible cost. The single POV holds; no secondary characters dilute focus.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vela’s interior contradiction—intellectual rigor vs bodily fragility—is embodied through her brass hand and the card; the final alliance with Caelus earns its cost because earlier duels literally scarred them. Micro-choices (tracing the shadow, extending the mechanical hand) crystallize values under live pressure. Backstory flags are anchored in tangible props and bleed into the present with causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lark’s contradictory impulses—yearning for reinvention yet clinging to past selves—are embodied in the molt ritual and the coffee-tin archive; the final choice to co-author resistance with Marin is earned by prior shared risk and costs him his lone-wolf identity. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Minor drift: “lantern-bearer” feels slightly abstract in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pianist’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the frozen clock yet ascending to trade its chime—are dramatized in embodied beats. Her final choice to reclaim the ticking sound and step offscreen carries visible cost: she forfeits the safe loop for an uncertain real night. Interiority is specific and character-bound; no stock therapy-speak. The only cap is that the projectionist remains a cipher, so status dynamics are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Calyx’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot press on basalt, the coppery seed on her tongue—but the climactic memory-for-trade choice arrives with only a single line of hesitation; the teacher’s name vanishes without a prior micro-choice that shows its weight, so the cost feels declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise—"cerulean regret" embodied in breath-stained lace; micro-choice of burying compass in pot crystallizes renunciation. Motivation arc from evasion to apology is earned, cost visible in leaving tree behind. Minor: late arrival of former pupil feels slightly convenient.

    Interiority is vividly embodied ("quill scratched faster from tenderness") but lacks contradictory impulses; obsession deepens linearly without visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)

    Vela's interiority blends embodied mechanics (brass fingers flexing) with intellectual tension, but Caelus's motivation lacks equal depth. Micro-choices like tracing shadows with the needle card reveal hierarchy of values, though "chaos of unsolved paradox" leans abstract. Final handshake earns credible endurance with visible cost (exposed scar).

    Lark’s molting ritual embodies contradictory impulses—shedding cynicism while fearing the new skin’s fragility—and his pivot to strategic performance ("inventoried the contraband") during Rourke’s intrusion earns the lantern-bearer shift through visible cost in the ashes. Marin’s pragmatic idealism ("photograph well for audit") contrasts Lark’s lyricism without flattening her agency.

    Interior contradiction (waiting vs playing) manifests physically in chord resolution; micro-choice to leave loop earns renunciation with visible cost (surrendering the film's safety), though "steely longing" borders on label without full embodiment.

    Interior contradiction shines in Calyx’s hesitation between duty and self, embodied by the seed’s coppery sting and hollowing memory loss. Micro-choices under pressure—biting the seed, planting it with laughter—reveal her hierarchy of values. Minor deduction: Aya function primarily as atmospheric chorus rather than deepening conflict through distinct interaction.

    Interior contradiction (apology as both goal and burden) manifests through embodied micro-choices like breath-tightening the lace; cerulean regret avoids diagnostic labels by anchoring in tactile ritual. Final renunciation of exile-as-pruning earns closure through prior causality.
