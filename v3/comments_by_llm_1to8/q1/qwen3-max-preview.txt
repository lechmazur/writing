    Elira's transformation from neutron star researcher to dust phenomenologist is well-motivated through concrete micro-choices (stopping wearing gloves, sleeping beside the slide). Her internal journey from viewing cataclysms as "punctuation, not plot" to finding cosmic patterns in dust shows genuine character evolution with visible cost (abandoning her prestigious field).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's transformation from glass artist to healer emerges through concrete actions (studying frost patterns, fusing old glass with canyon sand) rather than declaration. Her internal shift from seeking "triumph" to understanding survival as "subtraction" drives meaningful choices. Minor deduction for slightly abstract moments ("Purpose, she realized, wasn't a destination") that lean toward articulated wisdom rather than purely embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is crystal clear through embodied emotion and concrete internal experience, particularly in the visceral response to discovering the ice "sang back." The character's silent expressiveness creates genuine constraint that shapes every interaction. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("not from sorrow, but marvel") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The undertaker's transformation from passive resignation to active purpose is earned through concrete interaction with the lens fragments, with his "inadvertently stubborn nature" manifesting as meaningful action rather than label. His final choice to go "deeper" rather than surface-ward demonstrates genuine character cost. Minor deduction for some interiority that tends toward abstraction ("reverence," "belonging") rather than embodied sensation in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation is consistently rooted in her doctrine of anonymous care, with internal conflict between revealing herself and maintaining the spell of mystery. The final bell-ringing crystallizes collective agency with visible cost (sanctions deepening, resources scarce). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "intergenerational support" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artist's motivation is beautifully rooted in the "quiet, gnawing question: where is unused love stored?" Her contradictory impulses—pursuing an absence while maintaining steady hands that "trembled only when she thought of the pilgrim"—create authentic tension. The final choice to surrender through breath achieves genuine transformation with visible cost (the tear splitting into "a thousand filaments").

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation to discover time's texture is embodied through concrete sensory details and contradictory impulses (scientific curiosity vs. emotional need). The final realization about grief's coarseness and joy's porosity emerges from dramatized experience, not assertion. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "retrocognitive trap" that briefly lapses into concept-speak rather than maintaining embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's patient methodology and internal resolve create consistent motivation through concrete actions (decoding keys, planting spores, scattering seeds). Her choice to plant the arrow as a marker rather than use it as a weapon reveals character through restraint. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative") rather than fully embodied states in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply personal (sister's death driving the quest), with concrete embodied emotion throughout ("tears blurred her vision," "body thin from hunger").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thief's motivation is consistent and deepens through embodied moments like "heart pounding not with triumph but tenderness." Her actions align perfectly with her strange, pure desire to facilitate destiny's patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glassblower's motivation to abandon control systems and create safe spaces for inquiry drives consistent choices throughout, with her ritualistic narration revealing character through action. The final choice to leave vessels behind for others shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("thoughtfully spirited") that could be more embodied, though the contradiction between destruction (melting tools) and creation (glass spheres) works well.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's vulnerability-as-strength arc lands with earned transformation, embodied through trembling hands that steady into purposeful action. Interior contradiction plays effectively through the phobia-ridden stunt double who "moves like fear given legs" yet confronts betrayal with adaptive certainty. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("vulnerability isn't weakness—it's the crack through which truth enters") that briefly abstracts the emotional state rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's obsession with "charting absence" drives consistent micro-choices throughout, with her methodical summarizing of silences creating a concrete hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation to "thaw mistrust with transparency" drives meaningful choices through lens placement and vulnerable exposure, with the child's touch crystallizing trust at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vine dresser's motivation crystallizes through embodied action (polishing marbles as counter-narrative) and her forty-seven springs of conviction manifest in concrete choices. Her refusal of probability bands and defense of reciprocity drives genuine stakes. The final moment where she accepts the garden's acknowledgment completes her arc with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives concrete action through the lever pull, with her "mechanically warm" demeanor creating subtle tension against the cold environment. The adjacent-self encounter shows contradictory impulses acting in scene ("Don't let go" versus her own terror), and the final choice to adjust the lever by 2.7 degrees demonstrates micro-choice under pressure with visible consequence—the other self vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—decoding water-damaged images as sheet music—is highly specific and drives concrete action. Internal conflict manifests beautifully in the tension between playing and listening, between sound and silence. The final choice to "play" an invisible symphony demonstrates earned agency with visible emotional cost ("trembling, lungs empty, heart full").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's internal contradiction between swallowed truth and the need for release manifests physically through fever, trembling, and her interaction with the smudged orchid.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction between skepticism and compulsion drives authentic choices, particularly in the moment she touches the valve wheel and confronts her own recorded voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper's transformation from seeking preservation to pure witnessing is earned through concrete interaction with the refuge's visions. The final choice to "grip reality loosely" and write "not to record, but to release" demonstrates genuine character evolution with visible cost - the abandonment of the chronicler's traditional role.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "nurture lifelong wonder" drives consistent choices through music therapy and the hair curl's symbolic power. The internal contradiction between preserving childhood magic and accepting adult reality creates genuine tension, particularly when she shares the curl with the girl. Her response to the eclipse—smiling rather than panicking—reveals character through action under pressure, though some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("ordinary magic") rather than embodied specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian's motivation to preserve memory against entropy is clear and consistent, with her "sensitively perceptive" nature manifesting through concrete actions like feeling which pages "trembled with suppressed truth."

Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("letting its silent mythos anchor her") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)

Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("fog thicker than regret") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The priest's motivation to illuminate through rhetorical deconstruction is clear and consistent, with internal conflict between his role as exorcist and his understanding that the possession seeks completion rather than consumption. His micro-choices—painting the question mark in negation, using questions as weapons—reveal values under pressure. However, the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during the possession's approach, relying somewhat on conceptual rather than felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to conduct unheard symphonies from memory is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied details like pressing palm to shell and conducting with wrist flicks. The transformation from fortune cookie writer to memory conductor shows genuine character evolution through specific actions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "chronologically homesick" that could be more embodied, though the exhaustion constraint adds urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction between seeking connection and dissolving boundaries drives genuine tension through concrete embodied moments like "gravity yielded again, not with defiance, but with weary recognition." The confession sequence ("I was afraid," "I ran because I thought I was unworthy") earns its emotional weight through prior accumulation, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("labyrinth of self"). The final merger of echo-selves pays off the established pattern of fractured identity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's deafness creates genuine constraints that shape her teaching methods and final breakthrough. The students' transformations feel earned through embodied reactions (veteran crying, girl laughing at her own pulse), though some emotional transitions could be more gradual. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully in the numbness/presence tension.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's meticulous nature and "credibly curious" temperament create consistent motivation for his investigative choices. His internal shift from passive recorder to active investigator is earned through specific pressures, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it").

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion through the scent-triggered memory avalanche and the physical buckled knees. The protagonist's transformation from grief-avoidance to acceptance shows genuine internal conflict acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("sorrow's weight") rather than fully embodied states throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet's motivation through "ethically playful" engagement with moral ambiguity is consistent and drives her interactions with both rope and village. Her final choice to offer "texture" rather than answers shows earned wisdom. However, the village elders' sudden transformation from paralysis to weaving feels slightly unearned given their brief exposure to her philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to "unbind" beauty from the incomplete drives consistent choices through playing specific musical phrases for lost individuals. Her internal consistency holds as she maintains focus on unfinished stories rather than resolution, with the child's petal offering providing earned validation of her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vael's transformation from dealer to conduit is earned through the visceral subsumption of the chemist's memories, with contradictory impulses (transactional detachment vs. buried empathy) acting simultaneously in scene.

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "affectionate detachment" concept that could use more concrete grounding in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes believably from shrewd broker to "quiet architect of gentler economy," with the transformation earned through observed impacts on workers like Marta recognizing her sister. The "whimsically attentive" trait drives concrete actions throughout. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cautious exuberance—the kind that fears its own joy might shatter") that briefly pulls from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to "graft herself onto community" drives consistent choices through reed sculptures as pleas, search for Vesper, and ultimate transformation into the community's welcoming point.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The illustrator's motivation to find where echoes are born drives concrete actions throughout, with the pendant's heat and time-borrowing creating embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation through comprehension rather than vengeance creates genuine complexity, with contradictory impulses (holding back tears but letting them refract) acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation to find "the fortress of unspoken truths" drives concrete choices through the vault descent, with her analytical-artistic nature manifesting in how she maps shame "without judgment, only geometry."

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The immortal's motivation is crystal clear—seeking "what happens after goodbye" through eons of ennui—and drives every choice toward the fragment's activation. His contradictory impulses (boredom vs. reverence) act simultaneously in scene, particularly when he smiles at spatial mutiny. The final choice to step through carries visible cost (his sanctuary collapses) though the warlock's memory trade feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The child's internal contradiction between inherited deception and sought fairness drives genuine choices under pressure, with embodied details like weeping "from recognition" and the first "unguarded expression." The mortician and other seekers provide secondary pressure that tests the child's values.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stationer's motivation to collect "textures of different times" drives consistent, concrete actions through sensory transcription and invention.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict that drives choices throughout, with her reorganization tactics revealing consistent character traits under pressure. The foundation stone chip functions as both talisman and conscience, grounding her motivations. Deduction for some abstract phrasing around "hopeful desperation" and occasional diagnostic language ("dual allegiance aching") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inspector's motivation—witnessing what no one else would record—drives consistent choices through purposeful curiosity and bitter communion.

The final choice to label and not look back shows earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation is crystalline—seeking the "gathered hush" to unlock trapped memories through deliberate stillness against survival instinct.

Her final acceptance of death as vessel for the ephemeral shows earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to "thread a labyrinth with his own story" before discovery drives coherent choices, with internal conflict between inherited mistrust and the need for witness.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost bride's motivation is clear and rooted in her betrayal-turned-binding, with her "lovingly venomous" nature manifesting through devotion twisted into obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation to rebuild faith through archaeological reverence is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like roots "curling gently around her wrists."

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to preserve lost communications is clear and rooted in personal loss (the misrouted letter), driving her chalk-encoding mission. However, interiority relies heavily on conceptual exposition rather than embodied emotion—we understand her intellectually but don't feel her grief viscerally. The widow's message provides stakes, but the protagonist remains more vessel than character, lacking the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's methodical playfulness manifests through concrete actions (measuring decibel decay with a grin, humming counter-melodies) and her motivation evolves from professional restoration to personal transformation. The nested awakening sequence embodies internal contradiction as each layer strips away certainty, though the emotional progression could deepen further between revelation stages.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rogue scholar's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like planting linguistic payloads and humming dead syntax, with internal conflict between compliance performance and rebellion. The relationship with Dr. Vex creates a crucible moment when he recognizes his mother's lullaby and chooses alliance, altering the state of their resistance. Minor deduction for some tell-heavy passages about joining at sixteen rather than embodied revelation through present action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" drives consistent choices throughout, with her shell-dwelling isolation and nightly rituals embodying this singular purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker's motivation is embodied through concrete rituals—climbing mist-stairs, suspending the chime, mouthing vanished names—with the cracked bamboo as her "covenant."

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling - restoring trust through linguistic resurrection. Internal conflict between bold gambling and meticulous cross-referencing creates authentic tension. The final choice to conduct the symphony carries visible risk and cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("cautious exuberance") rather than fully embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The machinist's internal contradiction between rigid control and fluid mercy drives genuine tension, with embodied trembling and palm-pressing grounding her emotional state. Her "slyly heartfelt" methods show consistent character through indirect action rather than declaration. The final choice to embed compassion into maintenance logs demonstrates values hierarchy with clear cost—risking her position for downstream communities.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs through pigeons is deeply rooted in personal loss (mother's lullaby, the fire) and drives increasingly higher-stakes choices, particularly when the meteorite transforms her methods. Her reinventions carry genuine cost—the ledgers beneath floorboards show internal contradiction between erasure and inscription. The final choice to stop reinventing herself and leave ledgers open represents earned transformation with visible emotional cost ("laughed until her ribs ached").

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal journey from searching daughter to understanding sacrifice shows genuine emotional progression with embodied grief ("tears traced cold paths").

The firefly encounter crystallizes her values through action—choosing connection over documentation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's transformation from seeking lost things to understanding them as gifts shows earned change through concrete discovery. Her contradictory impulses (joy in loss, delight in vanishing) act simultaneously throughout, particularly when pressing seeds to skin triggers "giddy sorrow." The final choice to carry rather than solve mystery lands with visible cost—accepting incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation as an orchestrator of serendipity is consistent and specific, with concrete embodied details like "hands, calloused from chalk and coin." The character demonstrates clear internal logic through his analytical attention to randomness, though deeper contradiction or cost in his choices would strengthen the arc. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in peak moments ("orchestrated serendipity" reads as label-speak).

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between memory preservation and societal exile drives genuine choices, particularly the decision to teach despite danger. Embodied emotion through tide-synchronized skin and bleeding feet avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glazier's motivation to "illuminate value in the mundane" drives consistent micro-choices throughout, from stone-dropping to prism placement at Widow Hargrove's. His observational nature manifests in embodied perception ("vibrating up through the stone, into his bones") rather than abstract reflection. The choice to consecrate rather than escape the mundane carries visible cost in his isolation ("Others called him odd") and physical wear ("knees protesting").

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The firefighter's motivation crystallizes through embodied action (reading letters aloud, pressing box to sternum) and internal contradiction (fear driving commitment).

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming despair through mathematical precision rather than emotion. Her micro-choices (arranging patterns, launching balloons, recalibrating) reveal layered values with visible cost. The piece earns its Earned Stasis closure through accumulated choices, though interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("serene upheaval humming in her marrow") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartographer's motivation to discover "what walls dream about" and whether stone can forgive creates a compelling internal drive that propels her actions.

    Elara's motivation through grief and mathematical rebellion creates authentic tension, especially in her purposeful failure of stochastic calculus. The father's recognition of the lantern's shadows adds depth. However, some passages lean toward abstraction ("traverse—not physically, not yet, but mentally") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The operator's motivation to nurture "cultivated estrangement" drives consistent choices through wrong-number connections, with embodied details like spinning the harmonica disc during emotional peaks. The final self-referential call where she patches herself into the disc's resonance enacts internal contradiction effectively, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("endings needed to be taught how to begin") rather than staying grounded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation is deeply rooted in preserving intimate moments over grand gestures, with internal contradiction between loss and continuation embodied through concrete actions like kneeling at the jetty and transcribing with walnut ink. The covenant regeneration through "proximate causes" creates genuine character-driven escalation. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("haunted euphoria") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to continue archiving lands with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear—finding the cure for loneliness as pattern, not pill—and her contradictory "desperately jocular" nature shows authentic internal tension. The man's trembling confession about hospital vigils and alphabetized cans embodies specific loneliness that earns the final hand-steadying. Minor deduction for some therapeutic framing ("catalyzing connection") but the embodied details and earned final choice compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to map emotional depths through absorbed languages is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment of her synesthetic gift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" drives concrete actions through the anomaly, with "confidently uncertain" manifesting as both methodology and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "translate silence into music" through sign language is beautifully embodied through concrete action, and her teaching moment with the mute girl provides earned character development.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation intensifies from archive exploration to ancestral recognition, with contradictory impulses (destroyer/savior) acting simultaneously in the tapestry discovery scene. The transformation from "lending library arsonist" to "archivist of the unspoken" is earned through concrete discoveries, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("analytical intuition" as survival trait lacks specific embodiment).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses (carrying 27 souls while drumming rebellion). The transformation from passive subject to active "weaver/drummer/dreamer" is earned through concrete micro-choices. Loses points for some diagnostic label-speak ("fractured psyche," "entangled memories") and the final emotional resolution feels slightly too neat for the horror of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's ability to identify walks drives meaningful choices throughout, particularly her tracking of Delgado and decision to pass evidence to Ruiz based on his "measured, deliberate tread." Internal consistency strong with her navigation-by-sound matching her maintenance worker expertise. Minor deduction for some diagnostic clarity in the revelation about whispers/shouts rather than fully embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's motivation crystallizes through concrete details (the boy from Bridge Seven, creating light-glyphs for the lost) with embodied contradiction between her silence and active intervention. The drowned woman's interaction shows earned change through specific gesture. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hope's geometry") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elira's motivation is clear and consistent—she nurtures quiet rebellion through chess and wonder. The internal progression from solitary contemplation to witnessing transformation (Milo's art school epiphany) shows earned character work. However, secondary characters remain functional rather than complex, and some emotional beats rely on abstract description ("minds choosing differently") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's transformation from dock worker to soul-mender is earned through concrete mystical experience, with her internal resistance ("didn't believe in magic") giving way to embodied revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal emptiness and performative grief create compelling contradictory impulses, particularly in the whittling-as-erosion metaphor and the calculated compliance performance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet's motivation is embodied through trembling fingers rooted with certainty and her need to "touch what had been declared untouchable."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's colorblindness as synesthetic perception ("green wasn't green to him, but the damp velvet of moss") creates distinctive interiority, and his philosophy of finding beauty in imperfection drives concrete choices like arranging plants by texture rather than color. The barter system reveals character through action, though Marta's transformation feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira's characterization succeeds through embodied perception and concrete action (fingers brushing dust, singing an open vowel), with her internal drive clearly motivated by the search for authentic connection. The weeping "not from sorrow, but from recognition" demonstrates contradictory emotional layers, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("not to reach a destination, but to remember how to feel the road") rather than staying grounded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mourning jewelry maker's motivation through grief-driven creation is consistently rendered through concrete actions (tracing locket rims, folding origami, leaving coordinates). Her internal contradiction between isolation and connection-making through anonymous gifts shows genuine complexity. The "quieter, fiercer urge: to teach withering to bloom again" provides clear character-specific motivation that drives every action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation to map cultural patterns after systemic collapse is clear and consistent, driving her methodical examination of artifacts. Her steady curiosity manifests through concrete actions—measuring virality against irony, tracking pattern migrations—though internal contradiction could be more visceral. The visitor's "remembering forward" insight provides earned resonance, but the piece lacks sharp embodied emotion during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian's motivation crystallizes through concrete loss (silent daughter after witnessing sanitized massacre) and builds to earned action—purifying memory through patternless song. Internal contradiction plays out viscerally as she experiences "anguished joy" while touching the atoms of nostalgia, embodying simultaneous pain and triumph. The final choice to return and share "raw, patternless truth" with her daughter carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—hunting the shadow, embedding the stone—with embodied emotion ("breath caught," "wept for resilience"). The internal contradiction between preserving and accepting change drives meaningful choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between self-respect and compassion manifests through concrete micro-choices (reconstructing the tail, planning resignation with care protocols). The shift from blind trust to vigilant compassion shows genuine character evolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's transformation from "closure seeker" to someone who embraces continuation is earned through concrete struggle with the seed's revelations. The scar as both physical marker and evolving metaphor (from "tragedy to threshold") provides embodied emotional progression. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around grief and blessing that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gazer's motivation to seek "unused love" manifests through concrete embodied reactions—gasping from recognition, trembling fingers, letters "stitched into her ribs like a second skeleton."

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to free trapped creativity is consistent and embodied through concrete sensory details (hearing unspoken words, feeling them carve hollows in her ribs).

    The protagonist's motivation to "rediscover the uncharted territories within himself" drives consistent choices throughout, with embodied sensory details like "the hum of insight... vibrating in his marrow."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Characters operate more as archetypal vessels than individuals, but their collective mission reveals consistent motivation through embodied details like Elira's metronome clicking and Torvin's bark-listening. The final reframing of courage as "reserved—for when the leash breaks" earns the closure through accumulated gestures rather than dramatic change.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied characterization through concrete actions (trembling hands, pressing palm to cold step) and internal contradiction between safety and silence. The bellhop's choice to replace the bolt is earned through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("frostbitten hope").

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's contradictory impulses between justice and withdrawal manifest throughout, particularly in "She felt no triumph—only the hollow echo of justice delayed too long." Her final renunciation carries genuine cost as she refuses what her mission aimed to restore.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (bare feet on cold metal, trembling fingers) and her final choice to "seed" rather than reignite violence shows genuine character evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grandmother's contradictory impulses—reverence for tradition versus necessity for evolution—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in her fusion of "plant-whispers and glyph-meanings" into new ritual. Her final choice to disperse rather than possess the embryo's power demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost ("joints creaking like old timber"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around destiny and tradition that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's trauma-driven interiority is concrete and embodied through "phantom twinges that flare when storms brew," and the final transformation from anchor to compass shows earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "descend into necessary darkness" manifests through concrete actions of stitching fragments and painting on eyelids, with embodied cost ("Pain was the price of coherence").

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's renunciation of violence is embodied through the ritual sheathing of the knife and her cultivation methods, with internal consistency maintained throughout. The transformation from bounty hunter's daughter to peaceful cultivator shows clear motivation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fisher's cool-headedness under surreal pressure reads as genuine characterization, with her methodical transliteration of emotions into phonemes serving as both coping mechanism and hunting technique.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The heiress's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving truth against institutional erasure—with concrete embodiment through the telescope adjustments and pen nib handling. Her internal conflict between observation and intervention crystallizes in the "proof by contradiction" approach.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's journey from guilt to acceptance shows genuine internal conflict with embodied emotion (trembling ink, voice cracking). The transformation from tattooing misaligned stars to creating "Cradle Major" demonstrates earned change through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal journey from metallic city noise to understanding "emergent hush" is well-motivated with concrete embodied details (fingers tracing spirals, mist curling around ankles).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("ache in her ribs where the burns still throbbed").

Internal contradiction plays well in her choice to leave truth for uncertain discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's contradictory impulses—ferrying grief while maintaining detachment, offering the needle but not forcing resolution—create genuine internal tension that drives his final choice to extend the yarn needle. His "ambient awareness" manifests as embodied perception throughout (fog whispers, axle hums, horses' syncopated breaths), avoiding label-speak. The passenger's transformation from tears to resolve feels earned through the dramatized exchange, though her arc could use one more concrete micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The potter's motivation flows from consistent philosophical stance through concrete micro-choices (pouring water for the bee, choosing not to fire the clay).

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's transformation from tending plants to reflecting light demonstrates clear internal progression with embodied emotion ("knees aching, palms smudged").

Deduction for occasional abstraction ("sovereignty," "coexistence") that could be more embodied in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's transformation from isolated ghostwriter to dissolved essence shows clear motivation rooted in his "frayed edges" and longing for connection. The choice to step into the pool and dissolve carries visible cost—loss of physical form—though the emotional stakes could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in expertise, with concrete internal conflict between professional protocol and direct action. The choice to intervene carries visible professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fiddler's transformation from playing bridge-songs to stepping forward "into the disbelief" shows earned change through specific action (playing for the hitchhiker, interpreting the glass flake, releasing attachment).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chronicler's motivation to transmute grief into healing words is consistently embodied through concrete actions like singing to the guardian and writing poems to stars.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a covenant-keeper, with concrete embodiment through the glowing scars and root-fusion. Her internal state shows genuine contradiction between urgency and reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied contradictions throughout, particularly Elira's "fiercely gentle" stance manifesting through concrete actions like pressing palms to bark while humming lullabies.

The final renunciation (not translating the seedling's symbol) carries visible cost as she foregoes knowledge for something greater.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian's moon-phase fluctuation creates genuine internal contradiction ("Full moons sharpened her purpose; new moons softened her edges"), and her final choice to accept contradictions shows embodied tension through concrete action with the creel.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inspector's motivation is clear and consistent—dissolving isolation through the pearl's activation—with concrete embodied emotion (weeping from recognition, bones vibrating).

The transformation from seeker to conduit is earned through accumulated confessions, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the fragile pause between fear and surrender").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("accordion cradled like a child," "wept with raw solace").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The veiled dreamer's internal experience is richly embodied through concrete sensory details (glyphs blooming on skin, scent pulling her into memory) and her micro-choices reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's conflicted stance between empire and dream drives authentic choices, particularly her decision to use the violin despite knowing it will melt.

    The beautician mortician's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving consciousness at death's threshold—with concrete embodied details like "fingers stilled above the cold brow." The scholar's request for "lucid awareness at the brink" creates genuine stakes. However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("rhythm of pause," "architecture of cessation") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the protagonist makes no difficult micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal journey from wounded healer to self-healing is well-motivated through concrete details like the hairpin exchange and her caretaking history.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The skimmer's motivation to "navigate without moving" creates a compelling paradox that drives the entire piece, with internal consistency maintained through stillness-as-wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lamplighter's motivation crystallizes through concrete discovery rather than declaration, with his signed vow revealing layered temporal complexity. Internal contradiction manifests in his conscious pursuit of an impossible quest ("hunting the color of sound") while accepting its potential cost ("revelation, or madness").

    Elias's transformation from "gentle erasure" to memory preservation is well-motivated through accumulated encounters with photographs, each triggering concrete micro-choices (cataloging→murmuring narratives→public display). His internal contradiction between duty and growing reverence plays out through embodied actions, though some interiority relies on summary ("realized his task wasn't to erase memory"). The final stance crystallization ("humanity remembers") carries visible professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's internal contradiction between scientific rigor and hidden sentimentality drives authentic choices, particularly in her surrender to intuition over command. The transformation from "equations eclipsed awe" to "wonder was not the opposite of wisdom" is earned through concrete actions like coaxing flame through breath rather than spell.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving communal trust through careful management of information. Her internal conflict between truth and hope plays out through embodied details like the buckle gestures, and the final choice to walk toward the next arbor shows earned endurance with visible cost. The "burden as gift" complexity avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's internal journey from ego death to emotional reconnection is well-motivated, with concrete embodiment of his numbness and its dissolution. The duplicate brain's awakening as an autonomous entity rather than Kael's shadow demonstrates earned character evolution. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophical passages that lean toward tell over embodied show, particularly in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris demonstrates clear motivation rooted in his receptivity to the strange and commitment to innovation, with his vow to "safeguard space for innovation, even if it stank" driving consistent choices throughout. His internal experience is concrete and embodied, particularly in tactile moments like "fingertips brushing the soil as if reading braille." The character arc from receiving the seed to accepting its non-flowering as the point shows genuine progression with earned wisdom, though some philosophical passages edge toward abstraction rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's grief-driven compulsion is powerfully embodied through specific actions (conducting absence, clutching the pull cord handle) with visible cost. Internal contradiction between hope and loss acts simultaneously in scene, particularly in moments like dropping to his knees when hearing the full-bellied laugh. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("mournfully eager" repeated) rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's transformation from hollow waiting to patient emissary shows genuine character evolution through embodied details like "throat too thick for speech" and the shift from growling to offering its paw. The dimensional homesickness transmuting from "wound" to "compass" provides earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle sections that momentarily weakens the embodied quality.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elric's motivation is crystalline—breaking free from a destiny of perpetual failure through iterative destruction—and his "stoically sensitive" nature manifests beautifully in how he bears collapse while his eyes hold "bruised violet." The internal contradiction between his acceptance of failure and desperate need to create drives genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract introspection ("Hope was a destination; he was becoming the road") that edges toward label-speak rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "find the beginning in every ending" drives concrete choices through tuning methods and fragment placement, with internal contradiction between seeking silence versus signals. The final transformation from passive interpreter to active conductor is earned through accumulated understanding, though some interiority leans toward abstraction ("not metaphorically, but mechanically").

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The deckhand's resilient positivity drives genuine choices under pressure (whistling while scrubbing despite witnessing vanishings, descending alone into the grotto). His motivation crystallizes clearly ("every soul aboard deserved a single, solid world") and the final renunciation of permanence ("permanence was never the goal—transience was the truth") carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("patterns, once understood, could always be reknit") that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The architect's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking connection's texture through rational enchantment. Her calm purposefulness under surreal pressure creates compelling characterization. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("texture of connection") that could be more embodied, though the sinew thread physicality largely compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's "balancedly curious" trait drives meaningful choices throughout, particularly her pedagogical approach to edge geometry and her transformation of the anchor from relic to teaching tool. Her internal state during the power outage—imagining stars through kilometers of water while tracing coordinates—embodies contradictory impulses (loss/hope) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to reframe the anchor as "what we are not" carries visible cost: acknowledging permanent separation from the surface world.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tracer's motivation is beautifully rooted in preventing souls from fracturing through silence, with embodied emotion ("breath came in shallow hitches") and concrete interiority. The ghost girl's vulnerability and the tracer's compassionate response create genuine character-driven tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("emotional resonance") in opening beats that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's claustrophobia creates genuine embodied tension ("live wire sparking against stone"), and her motivation to honor the unremembered drives meaningful choices. The transformation from fear to carrying "open sky within her" earns its arc through concrete action, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("weight of return").

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation as reluctant medium for digital ghosts is clear and rooted in his bureaucratic erasure, with the heartbeat counting serving as a concrete embodiment of his liminal state. The porcelain shard functions as both tactile anchor and emotional tether, grounding his choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "fetching wisdom from failure" that could be more embodied in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storyteller's motivation is precisely embodied through concrete actions—feeding the diamond selectively, matching syllables to bird patterns, conducting sound through copper veins. Her internal contradiction between preserving and releasing her mother tongue manifests physically in how she "articulates quietly, precisely" even as generations of voices join hers.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from bitter exile to cosmic acceptance is earned through embodied struggle, with the scar-hiding gesture and field notebook tears grounding her emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The violinist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—playing "resonantly soft" music to awaken dormant life. Internal conflict manifests in physical detail: "bow trembling," "fingers blistered," yet she persists. The transformation from guardian to gardener in the statues represents earned change through protagonist agency, with visible cost in her physical exhaustion and the spent locust shell.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mailman's motivation crystallizes through concrete details ("linking absences," "smuggling hope") with embodied tension when handling the storm bottle. His respectful rebellion manifests in specific gestures - bowing when saluted, smiling during searches. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "broken promises heal" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carpenter's silence as "native tongue" and his methodical restoration create a consistent, embodied character whose motivation crystallizes through action rather than exposition. His final choice to complete the carousel carries visible cost (lifelong dedication) though some interiority relies on abstraction ("silence became a chorus").

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian's "sanely eccentric" nature manifests through concrete choices (alphabetizing by emotional resonance, shelving grief between calculus) that drive her quest. Her final act of reawakening stories shows earned agency with visible cost—the scarf's transformation and patrons' altered experience.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian's obsessive pursuit creates clear motivation, with her decades-long search for the runaway dream driving concrete choices. The moment of reunion ("the child, now grown, standing beside her") lands with earned emotional weight, though the resolution's abstract quality ("translucent but solid") slightly softens the cost that should be more visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith demonstrates clear motivation through consistent purposeful action, and his internal state is conveyed through embodied details like feeling power "in his marrow." However, the character lacks specific contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the emotional progression relies on abstract states rather than concrete internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's chronic curiosity drives consistent choices from investigation to final surrender, with embodied emotions like "the ache still lived beneath her ribs."

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction—"combative tenderness" manifests in sharp corrections that forge resilience. Her backwards walking and tea-leaf reading create distinctive behavioral signatures. The cartographer's transformation from "hollow-eyed" despair to "firmer strokes" demonstrates earned change through specific interaction, though some interior states lean toward abstraction ("heart quiet").

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation to preserve wonder is embodied through concrete actions (weaving memories, humming lullabies) rather than stated, with visible cost in her tears and decades of weathering. The internal conflict between cosmic duty and personal inability to "bear a world without that shimmer" creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "essence" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to balance the world's "quiet axis" by unknotting silence is consistently enacted through embodied ritual work, with internal experience ("She hesitated. Some knots resisted. Some had teeth") differing from external calm. The fisherman's "I cut the line" confession crystallizes moral complexity without resolution, and the final choice to continue unknotting carries visible cost ("joints stiff"). Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the opening's "interlaced hush" before grounding occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's methodical curiosity and visceral motivation (grandmother's lost maps) compel her investigation with consistent embodied details like "fingertips brushing the damp stone." The final choice to leave yarrow as a "cartographer's token" shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("silence was not void but vessel") that briefly distances from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's relationship with death as "a first-name basis acquaintance" creates a distinctive emotional stance that earns the final wave through accumulated specificity. The protagonist's analytical detachment ("dissected grief like equations") credibly transforms into connection through embodied details like the globe warming when admitting missing their sister. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("letting go isn't a variable. It's a verb") that briefly undercuts embodiment in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to bridge loneliness through encoded art is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in trembling fingers and tears of recognition. The internal conflict between isolation and connection drives meaningful choices, particularly in the shift from private encoding to inviting others. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("driftingly alert sorrow") that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The servant's interiority is concrete and specific, with embodied emotions like "tears...hovered, crystalline, at the edge of her lashes." Her micro-choices (kneeling, breathing before opening the diary) reveal values under pressure. The "warmly inquisitive" trait manifests through consistent actions rather than labels. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in processing complex grief without more contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The meteorologist's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (cataloging clouds by emotion) and internal contradictions ("quietly explosive"). Her transformation from scientific observer to emotional archivist is earned through the violin string memory. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("resigned acceptance") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's face blindness becomes a lens for perception rather than deficit, with her tactile reading of the coin driving the central action. Her internal realization about blindness-as-lens arrives through embodied discovery, not epiphany. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract formulation of "essence in texture" rather than more embodied language.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen's curiosity drives genuine discovery through the hopscotch cipher, with his motivation rooted in the world's "blank spaces whisper[ing] to him like half-remembered lullabies." His transformation from apprentice to "maestro" conducting luminance shows earned growth with visible stakes. Minor deduction for some tell-heavy passages about his traits rather than fully embodied demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The locksmith's internal journey from seeking "the rhythm of repair" to understanding "that repair is not restoration, but reharmonization" shows clear motivation driving meaningful change. Her choice to leave empty-handed but full-hearted demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost (the dissolved silver threads). However, the shift feels slightly abstract in places, particularly the mirrors showing past moments without deeper embodied contradiction in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's ghostly agency paradoxically drives concrete action through chalk messages and bell-finding, with her "strangely trustworthy" presence creating authentic character tension. The settlers' transformation from refugees to kin shows earned collective change, though individual characterization beyond Kael and Liora remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The adjuster's motivation through duty and compassion is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through scarred fingers and crystallized tears. The puppet head functions as a meaningful external catalyst that shapes his choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bruised awe swelling") in emotional peaks rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker's resignation and arithmetic motivation ("refused to let the chorus grow louder") create authentic interiority. His indirect rescue method reveals character through specific actions rather than declaration. Minor deduction for the girl's somewhat stock presence, though her "annoyed at the ground" observation adds texture.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chemist's grief-driven transformation from seeking control to accepting flow shows clear internal contradiction acting in scene. Her final choice to design "Chrysalis Mesh" that "sang as it surrendered" demonstrates earned change with visible cost—accepting her daughter's death rather than fixing it. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("grief hadn't vanished; it had softened, unknotted") in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vendor's motivation to "unwrite herself" drives consistent choices through measured transactions. Her internal contradiction between helping others erase while carrying her own void creates authentic tension, particularly in "each sale a mirror, each customer a reflection of the void she carried." The micro-choices of incising marks and recording absences reveal character through action, though some interiority relies on abstract declaration rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's ability to taste memories drives her physical journey and emotional transformation, with clear internal conflict between absorbing and smoothing painful memories. The subsumption sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (staggering but not retreating), and her final choice to cook again carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hollowed but whole") that briefly dulls embodiment in transition moments.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's empathetic decisiveness drives meaningful action through the tower climb and rehabilitation method, with her choice to leave the weight as "permanent anchor" showing character-specific cost. The grain elevator's transformation from isolation to voice demonstrates earned change through Elara's specific intervention. However, the elevator's sudden multilingual eloquence strains psychological credibility, and Elara herself remains somewhat archetypal despite vivid external actions.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to "modify" rather than mourn is clear and consistent, with internal conflict between past sterility and newfound emotional excavation visible throughout. The choice to integrate the child's memory with her own demonstrates agency under pressure with visible emotional cost ("legs stiff from kneeling," "eyes wet but unblinking"). However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract—the specific trade-offs of her synaptic modifications lack concrete dramatization beyond metaphorical description.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira's prism-minded perception drives authentic choices throughout, particularly her ability to decode the seventh eye only during gravity's inversion. Her progression from archivist to awakener of vigilance feels earned through concrete actions rather than epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal journey from exile to renewed purpose is coherent and earned through concrete details (worry stone, memories of pupils). The character makes a genuine choice to carry forward his knowledge differently, though the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving silence as empathy's first language—with concrete embodiment through her synesthetic perception of frequencies. The character demonstrates genuine internal complexity through her method of resonating rather than fixing, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("vessel tuned to the frequency of another's unspoken ache"). Her final choice to continue her work despite the fireworks shows earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's olfactory sensitivity drives concrete choices (climbing to greenhouse, inhaling the corpse flower) with embodied reactions ("tears streaming not from disgust, but recognition"). Her ambition for "serenity within motion" manifests through specific actions rather than declarations, though some interiority borders on diagnostic ("grief is fertilizer, fear is root-depth").

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding the orchard's uncanny resilience—with concrete embodied details like "gloves gripped the throttle tight" and her weeping from recognition. The transformation from fixing to listening represents earned change with visible cost (returning each inversion). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("Not from awe. From recognition") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's investigative mindset and methodical approach create a consistent, specific character with clear motivation to prevent future disasters. Internal conflict between scientific detachment and personal connection (Varga's patch) operates simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's synesthetic gift creates specific, embodied perception ("taste the G-minor as burnt caramel"), and her choice to strike the bells shows clear motivation rooted in preserving wonder. However, there's no meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she proceeds with unwavering purpose. The final renunciation (leaving the cavern) lacks visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The relic keeper's motivation is clear and consistent—harvesting insights from failure rather than glory—with concrete embodied details like trembling fingers showing precision rather than fear. The protagonist makes meaningful micro-choices (breathing across the reed rather than playing, walking away from the flute) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Internal complexity shows in her rejection of the Council's "never" versus her lived experience of "hollow eyes of abandoned realms."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's transposed empathy drives concrete choices throughout—borrowing the widow's grief to create "The Arithmetic of Absence," pressing the halo to the skeptic's forehead. Her method of deliberate ambiguity as pedagogy shows consistent motivation, and the final walk into darkness with "empathy still transposed" demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (the dimming halo, her lost name).

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong internal contradiction between routine calcification and wonder recovery drives the piece. The courier's transformation from jaded to wonder-spreading is earned through concrete choices (choosing Hollow Market, sharing pendant with child). Minor deduction for the mentor figure remaining somewhat abstract despite his thematic importance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mystic's motivation to prove objects absorb emotions drives consistent choices through prism-frost communion, with embodied sensory work ("fingers numb but steady") and internal contradictions between scientific rigor and spiritual openness. The driver's complex emotional state—guilt, love, relief in surrender—creates layered characterization despite his absence. Minor deduction for some abstraction in lines like "Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity" that edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The spinner's sacrifice through dissolution into the weave demonstrates exceptional internal contradiction—her need to reach him requiring self-erasure. The amber bead functions as both memory anchor and beacon, embodying her conflicted impulse to hold on while letting go. Her choice to weave herself into the pattern piece by piece shows earned causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlo's quiet determination manifests through consistent embodied actions—descending daily into shafts, tracing glyphs, weaving magic into tools—with his internal contradiction between meekness and forge-like resilience driving meaningful choices. The final transformation where he "becomes the barter" is earned through accumulated micro-choices, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("forge waiting for its spark") rather than fully embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation to uncover the withheld truth is clear and consistent, driving her through the parallel universe with embodied sensory details ("fingers tracing the oily floor").

Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her initial quest and limited concrete micro-choices under pressure in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's grief-driven solitude and ritual tenderness create genuine internal contradiction, particularly in how he protects connection while maintaining isolation. The moment with the sea glass as "bottled feeling of safety" embodies complex emotion effectively. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "hollowing, a draft where safety used to sit" which edges toward label-speak rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The herald's characterization emerges through poetic accumulation rather than dramatized choice, with her accidental prophecy and world-steering remaining abstract concepts rather than embodied struggles. The piece relies heavily on lyrical assertion ("She never meant to foretell") without showing internal contradiction in action. Her final gesture of blowing a kiss lacks the earned causality and visible cost required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dye master's internal journey from seeking external magnetism to cultivating her own fractures shows strong character evolution with embodied details (tracking sun trails with breath and memory).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The worker's transformation from technical repair to spiritual cartography is earned through concrete discovery, with her motivation shifting naturally from academic to arboreal to ultimately memorial. The final choice to become "cartographer of witnessed sorrow" carries visible cost (abandoning her original role) though some interiority relies on abstraction ("resonance" without sufficient embodiment).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper's scattered memory mirrors the realm's fragmentation effectively, with her incomplete lullaby memory embodying the loss of communal bonds. Her transformation from fragment curator to "loom" represents earned change through vulnerability rather than mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's compassionate nature manifests through concrete actions (sensing which volumes "wept, which laughed") and her internal conflict between empathy and the Society's logic-driven values creates genuine tension. The final choice to read aloud to empty chairs demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost—she risks discovery and judgment. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unorthodox empathy" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal journey from grief-carrying routine to quiet rebellion is well-embodied through concrete actions (kneeling, bread-breaking, seed-planting) rather than declared states. The "uncloaking" moment physically manifests her internal shift, and her choice to garden without permits shows agency with visible risk. Minor deduction for some abstraction in lines like "patience is the grammar of absolution" that edge toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's meticulous nature drives her scientific-spiritual methodology, with internal consistency between her reverence for preservation and existential motivation. The contradiction between professional detachment and emotional response to the vows creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" is distinctive and drives concrete actions through multiple failed attempts. Her internal complexity shows in the tension between fear calcified into purpose and her calculated retreats. The final choice to reveal the watch fob carries visible cost through Marla's frozen recognition and The Chain's flight.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The luminous skeptic's internal contradiction between doubt and curiosity drives genuine choices, particularly in her testing methodology (copper/ozone/honey) and final shift from skepticism to trust. The man's characterization as archive rather than victim adds depth. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of her "luminous" quality and some therapy-speak around "surrender" in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong internal contradiction between suppressed creativity and the need to express drives genuine character tension. The final choice to draw and release carries visible emotional cost through tears and the father's lingering portrait. Embodied emotion through charcoal-stained fingers and physical reactions to the cave elevates beyond mere labels.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking lost conversations drives every action. Her physical wilting near dishonesty creates embodied stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bell tuner's seasonally mute nature drives meaningful choices throughout, with her silence as "precision, a canvas upon which vibration painted meaning." Her motivation crystallizes through embodied action—placing palms on ice, adjusting counterweights during storms—though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("meteorology of soul"). The child encounter provides the sole test of her values, where she chooses awakening over explanation with visible impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The android's internal contradiction between programmed nostalgia and evolved understanding drives authentic choices, particularly in the burn sequence where fears transform into integrated harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's quest motivation is deeply rooted in grief and love, with concrete embodiment through trembling fingers and the accumulation of wildflowers marking each breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation to forgive inherited guilt through forgery is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (trembling fingers, blood covenant with thorn).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost whisperer's motivation to salvage emotional echoes rather than material wealth drives clear, consistent choices throughout, with her careful truth-weaving creating genuine internal tension. The child ghost's characterization through dream cameos and the final "You'll be safe" memory effectively embodies preservation instinct under crisis. Minor deduction for some abstraction in describing her methods ("weaves truth carefully") rather than showing the cost of that carefulness in more embodied moments.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's logical-emotional nature manifests through calculated resonance-matching while trembling with awe, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her transformation from engineer to "keeper of balance" is earned through prior causality with visible cost (exhaustion, becoming a living buffer).

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapper's character emerges through concrete choices—kneeling on ice to trace constellations, teaching children to read ice rather than borders, refusing spectacle for stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with Elias's weathered hands cradling the burned letter and Mara's brittle voice/crossed arms showing resistance. The final choice to keep the letter as "a map of what could still grow" earns meaningful change through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to preserve wisdom drives consistent action through ritual and peripheral awareness, with internal contradiction between discipline (masked side) and acceptance (exposed side) embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear—transmuting collective pain through patient observation—and her "perceptively calm" trait manifests in concrete actions like tracing photographs and studying details.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her decades of hospice work, with the vinyl shard serving as a concrete embodiment of her life's purpose. The piece shows her micro-choices through specific hymns that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, internal contradiction is more stated than actively conflicting in scene, and the spiritual ascension lacks the embodied struggle that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's "quietly deliberate" trait drives consistent choices throughout, from recording observations to stepping through the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist demonstrates clear motivation through embodied patience and ritual precision, with her purpose revealed gradually through action rather than exposition.

Her internal conflict is concrete and embodied, shown through tactile interactions with the coral and cast.

Her internal conflict—between grief and purpose—is dramatized through tactile, sensory engagement with her father's artifacts.

    Characterization is rich and contradictory, with the exorcist's flawed past and present regret driving her micro-choices. Elias's internal conflict is legible through his silence and rough voice.

    Characterization is profound and embodied, with the protagonist's motivation ("not salvation or dominion, but clarity") driving every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is a masterclass in interior contradiction, with her rebellion and newfound responsibility acting simultaneously. Her micro-choices, like leaving the scrawl for her father, reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her actions; her "spiralingly calm" demeanor is embodied, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira's characterization is concrete and motive-driven, with her "gardener of second chances" mission compelling high-stakes choices.

    The dreamless guard’s engineered nature is a consistent, compelling flaw that motivates his mission. His lack of interior contradiction is a feature, not a bug, and his final, subtle physical release ("shoulders softened") is an earned, embodied emotional shift that carries the cost of his labor. However, the characterization remains slightly monolithic; a moment of internal friction, however small, would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)

Slight reliance on reflective summary in middle paragraphs, but anchored in present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and her cautious exuberance is a compelling, specific trait. However, her journey is largely guided by the watch's external prompts, reducing the sense of her own contradictory impulses driving key turns under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)

Her final choice to activate the violin is a perfect crystallization of her established values and struggle. The micro-choice of touching the strings without a bow is a profound, character-specific action that reveals her hierarchy of values. The only minor flaw is a slight over-articulation of her dream in the reflective block, but it remains anchored in the present stimulus.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mortician's motivation is clear, sacred, and rooted in decades of practice. Her final choice—infusing the chip—is a high-stakes micro-decision that reveals her values.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The skimmer’s characterization is a masterclass in Earned Stasis. Its weathered resolve and function as a landmark are rooted in consistent, embodied traits ("duty as your skin"). The final choice—to wait and mirror guidance—is a profound renunciation earned by the text's central thesis on stillness. A minor deduction for the abstract nature of its purpose, which, while thematically resonant, slightly distances the reader from a more visceral internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)

The final choice to use the buckle as a chime is a credible endurance, earned by the prior mistake with the village, foreclosing the path of direct warning with a visible cost of constant vigilance. A hairline deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of "communal faith" which feels more thematic than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is exquisitely rendered through concrete, embodied contradiction ("joy and grief, guilt and absolution") and a final micro-choice that is earned by his prior endurance.

Kael, however, functions more as an observer; his wide-eyed wonder is noted but lacks the contradictory interiority or micro-choices that would make his final transformation feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, driven by a concrete, embodied ache for answers. The cartographer's "quiet drive" is shown through meticulous, obsessive action (17 dry seasons refining whistles) and a final micro-choice to pack her satchel and climb, revealing her hierarchy of values. The final stance—a challenge, not a plea—is earned by prior causality and carries immense cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The historian's "emotionally rational" trait is embodied through concrete micro-choices (e.g., pulse quickening from the weight of truth, not fear) and a credible final stance of resolve. Her internal conflict between reverence for the past and duty to truth is dramatized, not summarized. The final choice to recapture public imagination feels earned by her established methodical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's stoicism and sensitivity are embodied in her actions (cradling the doll, weeping silently) and micro-choices (using the last ink, sealing the letter).

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Protagonist's "tranquilly perceptive" attribute is embodied through active stillness and micro-choices like using a bone stylus, though emotional range remains somewhat narrow under pressure.

The final smile and inner warmth signal a meaningful, credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The survivor's motivation is a compelling, original blend of trauma and cartography, rooted in concrete memory ("Marta, the bridesmaid who sang off-key"). Her calibrated desperation is a credible, embodied response to loss. The final choice to "dive into the pools" is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing on vengeance for a more complex, costly pursuit. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of her goal ("to prove that potential doesn't die"), which trends toward theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction—efficiency vs. awe—is embodied through concrete micro-choices (e.g., tracing glyphs with a surgeon's precision while catching her breath in awe). Her final renunciation of the search is earned by the chip's dramatized re-tuning, with the cost of shed selfhood made visible in her tears.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's guilt and motivation are concrete and drive every choice. Her embodied reaction to the memory ("She vomited into the surf") is a peak moment of character under pressure. The final renunciation of her old trade is earned by the causal revelation. A minor deduction for a single instance of near-diagnostic summary ("now reduced to stitching lies") which is quickly anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion; the negotiator's micro-choices under pressure reveal a complex hierarchy of values. The final exchange of relics feels earned by prior causality with visible cost. The prosecutor's characterization is slightly less distinct in voice, but his grief is legible and contributes to the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (e.g., "merrily melancholic surrender"). The final choice to paddle is earned by prior causality, and the cost of her shattered past is visible on the page. The navigator's competence is balanced with genuine struggle, and her emotional progression is realistic, avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    The seeker’s motivation ("to kindle empathy where none remains") is a stark, original driver that intensifies under pressure. Their final choice to release the baseball is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The internal contradiction—hollow yet haunted—is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction is vividly embodied in the protagonist's "quiet certainty of tectonic plates shifting," merging grief with transformative faith. Her micro-choice to surrender to the conjuring process reveals a hierarchy of values where love outweighs entropy. The final metamorphosis is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her former self legible in her becoming "something more, something less, something in-between."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice—releasing rather than reclaiming lost time—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The protagonist's "willingly perplexed" stance is a consistent, character-specific flaw that complicates her choices authentically.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elira’s characterization is masterful, with interior contradiction dramatized on the page ("You carried me like a wound; now carry me like a wing"). Her pacifism is a consistent trait that intensifies under pressure, and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the Tear dissolving). The shadow work is a genuine internal conflict, not a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.4)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in micro-choices like weeping tears that turn to mist. The final choice of release is earned by prior causality, and the cost of her own unlived life is felt on the page. A hairline slip: her motivation ("to understand the texture of transformation") is stated but could be more fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and character-specific, embodied in the tracing of the quill holder. The "calmly inventive" trait is demonstrated through meticulous planning. However, the emotional state is somewhat monolithic; a moment of contradictory impulse (e.g., fear of discovery) would elevate it further. The final endurance is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with the curse's emotional cost ("stole surprise, stole awe") grounding his motivation. His final understanding is earned through on-page struggle and the grandmother's memory, a decisive change with visible cost. The contradiction between his initial view of the curse and its final transformation is handled in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through ritual ("each breath counted, each unspoken verse distilled into the weight of her stillness"). The final stance of becoming her own archive is earned by the causality of her vigil, with the cost of her endured silence made legible. Contradictory impulses of fury and tranquility act simultaneously, defining her "furiously tranquil" state.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The philosopher’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“brass fingers twitching,” “recalibrating his internal chronometer”), and his “diplomatically fierce” trait constrains his choices, visible in his refusal to gloat upon success. His mechanical arm is a lived-in detail that charges the final image. The woman is equally sharp, her late entrance a deliberate tactical choice. Their partnership is earned through prior textual history, though her internal contradictions are less explored than his.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Molt's sardonic shell and subsequent molt into a "gardener of the impossible" is a profound, earned internal change. Her contradictory impulses are shown in scene (laughing sharply at Elias's words that "stuck like burrs"). The final choice to plant seeds and sing is a micro-choice that reveals a complete hierarchy-of-values shift, rooted in the specific cost of her grief.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's motivation is clear, complex, and intensifies under pressure. Her "strategically creative" trait is demonstrated through her mapping of the arbor's resonance, not just stated. The final choice is a perfect synthesis of her longing and defiance, earning the decisive change with visible cost. A hairline deduction for a slight over-reliance on abstract motivation language ("surprise fate") in the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is clear, embodied, and rooted in a profound desire to protect cultural memory. His internal conflict between duty and doubt is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion, particularly in the moment of luminous doubt that pricks him.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elio's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, poetic worldview. His actions are consistent, and his final micro-choice (touching the new leaf) reveals a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and consistent—“to strip needless drama”—and her micro‑choices (ditching gloves, sleeping in the greenhouse, shifting where she publishes) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is distinctive, grounded in sensory detail and professional lens rather than labels. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal, but the renunciation of her former track reads earned with visible social cost (“breakdown”).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied through tactile actions—studying frost, rebuilding a kiln, and gifting glass. Motivation (heal/transform via “retracing”) is clear and consistent. The contradiction—survival as subtraction vs. making luminous work—registers, though conflict remains mostly inward and gentle. Emotional beats avoid therapy‑speak and feel character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, coherent motivation (to translate silence into music) and embodied emotion (skin, bones, heart as instruments) anchor her interiority. The contradiction—grief versus pragmatic resolve—registers but never strains under live pressure, keeping conflict relatively low‑heat. Micro‑choices (fork selection, warming the C512 against her wrist, where to strike) reveal values without therapy‑speak. Change is an earned stance: she commits to continuing the work, with the cost of lost voice and crew still humming beneath the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The undertaker’s motive—answering the lens’s calls—arises credibly from his history and stubbornness, and his hands-on choices (dismantling, embedding, activating) align with that. Interiority is embodied and particular (“molars ache,” bone-handled tools), with a reverent shift at the end that reads earned. However, the internal contradiction is modest: once he commits, there’s little on‑page hesitation or competing impulse. The visible cost is present but soft—he turns from the surface toward deeper work, not a wrenching sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motive—intergenerational support through anonymous care—is precise and embodied in repeated micro‑choices (not ringing the bell, the nightly runs, the refusal to self‑identify). The note “Why stay anonymous?” applies pressure that reveals her governing value system without speechifying. The endurance choice at the end (leaving the bell for a successor, continuing in predawn) reads as earned stasis with felt cost (self‑effacement under risk). Interior conflict is quiet but credible: desire to bind community vs. the temptation to claim responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The artist’s motive is clean and character‑specific, and her breath‑led micro‑choices (aperture adjustments, packing the obscura, tracking by lungs, matching breath) align with it. Interiority is textured through sensory attention rather than labels. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure are faint, and the cost of her surrender reads more as serenity than a foreclosing loss. The final shift feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s driving motive—“texture”—is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (touching the fragment, walking barefoot, relinquishing the photographs) reveal a credible hierarchy of values under pressure. The shock when the photos disintegrate gives us embodied cost and a moment of genuine recoil before her shift to acceptance. Internal contradiction (grief vs. artistic hunger) is present if understated. The final renunciation reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation and tactics are crystal clear and embodied—her patience, chains, and agrarian know-how drive every micro‑choice. The interiority is particular (soil, spores, chord decoding) without therapy‑speak. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, which flattens the crucible a touch. Still, the closing renunciation (leaving key in the arrow, accepting risk) reads earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline from the opening—she comes “not for refuge but resonance”—and her actions (feeding the forge her sister’s absence, pressing the device to her temple, choosing to leave) align with it. Interiority is embodied through synesthetic perception and marrow-tracked time, avoiding abstract labels. A live contradiction—grief’s pull versus a utilitarian mission for others—threads the piece. The Earned Stasis at the end (leaving without healing) carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is crystalline and specific—she “translates” fate rather than steals it—and her actions align. Interiority is lightly handled but distinct; we feel her tenderness and discipline without exposition. The main weakness is limited contradiction or on‑page friction; she encounters little resistance, so her micro‑choices never truly pinch. The visible cost (anonymity, the half‑empty jar) helps earn endurance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—abandon power to craft sanctuaries—and her actions align: sweeping, resting, forging orbs, and leaving. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (calloused fingers, heat, wobbling spheres) rather than label-speak. Internal conflict is subtle (renunciation vs. making) and could use one sharper moment of doubt or risk. Still, the final choice to depart reads earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich, particular interiority (“move like fear given legs”) and lived contradictions (phobic stunt double) drive credible choices under pressure. Motivation tightens from decoding guilt-trails to burning the film, with an earned reconfiguration at the end. A few thesis-like lines verge on telling, but the embodied beats (knees cracking, dust, heat) keep it grounded. The final stance reads earned, with visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    A striking, coherent interior motive—mapping absence—drives every micro‑choice, culminating in the earned decision to enter the night she charted. Embodiment is vivid (salt, flaking gold, calloused fingers), showing a lived method rather than declared genius. However, internal contradiction is minimal; we rarely see competing impulses challenge her poise. The cost is felt, but a sharper on‑page fray at the brink could deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The janitor’s patience, iterative tuning, and final renunciation of external answers in favor of inward listening read as motivated and earned. Micro‑choices (returning nightly, re‑tuning to emotion, sitting to replay activation, accepting the violin’s dissolution) reveal values under quiet pressure. The internal contradiction—service habit versus self‑inquiry—subtly animates the arc without speechifying. The ending’s endurance choice forecloses a path (external origin hunt) with a felt cost (loss of the violin) and a reweighted purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions (arranging tickets, angling the lens, then choosing stillness) align with it under pressure. Interiority is embodied through tactile attention (cool glass, breath, weight of withheld glances). The change registers as earned when she accepts the lens’s cracking and leaves the tickets behind. Slight limit: her internal contradiction is muted; she reads steady more than torn.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation and interiority are vivid and character‑specific: her ritual polishing and refusal of algorithmic cultivars align with a long, scarred history. The “mended deception” anecdote shows contradictory impulses (fear masked as indifference) that inform present choices. The intern’s arrival briefly tests her stance and reveals status dynamics without derailing POV. Cost is implied more than felt, keeping this just short of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motive—prove lateral time—drives clear micro‑choices (bypass protocols, pull, hold, adjust 2.7°). Interiority is specific to her vocation, though internal contradiction is light beyond duty vs. risk. The “Don’t let go” moment compresses resolve under pressure effectively. Cost is mostly conceptual, not deeply emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Her motive—to decode the flood‑composed score and “listen” to silence—is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (lantern angle, mirroring the ghost, playing without sound) align with it. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, filtered through a musician’s bias. The arc to “purpose” reads as earned stasis with felt cost (trembling, lungs empty), though internal contradiction is lightly expressed. A note of fear or doubt under pressure could have layered stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira’s motives—escaping a swallowed lie and seeking consequence—are precise and embodied; her micro‑choices (opening the hatch, pinning the illustration outside) align with her contradictions (beauty vs. honesty, silence vs. rupture). Emotions are textured in the body (fever tremors, wind sting) rather than labeled. The final stance—enduring with cost rather than confessing—reads as Earned Stasis. Slight safety lies in the oracle articulating some insights that she might otherwise discover through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied interiority and a coherent drive: skeptic, grief-struck, yet compelled to “calibrate” belief against guilt. Micro-choices under pressure—entering, ungloving to touch, digging out the radio, twisting the wheel—reveal values and contradictions. The self-implicating realization (“a prop she’d unconsciously lugged here”) deepens flaw and agency. Slight neatness to that inference keeps this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    A singular, coherent interiority with tactile choices (unfolding the swan, entering, returning, writing) grounds the keeper. Embodied emotion (“trembling palms,” tears) reads specific rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is mild—devotion to nonjudgment encounters only a soft ache—so pressure on motive is limited. Still, the final Earned Stasis (“softened… only witnessing”) feels earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—nurturing lifelong wonder—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (singing, producing the curl, letting it pass to a child). Interiority is consistent and embodied through attention to sound and touch rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little resistance beyond ambiance, which limits depth under pressure. The quiet cost of relinquishing the keepsake lands but could be more sharply dramatized at the handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.7)
    The historian’s motive—salvaging memory from entropy—is concrete and consistent, and her micro-choices (probing the hearthstone, cross-referencing symbols, deciding to descend) align. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“seismograph” perception; reading walls), though internal contradiction is limited. The change at the end is a credible stance crystallization rather than a revelatory leap. Slight lack of on‑page cost or doubt keeps this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and method are vivid and consistent, and his micro‑choices (timing fortunes, aligning the lens, hiring the analyst) reveal character through action. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he faces little emotional resistance or genuine risk. The role of “weaver/conductor” is well articulated but rarely pressures him in ways that force a costly choice. The result is persuasive but not deeply tested characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear (illumination over exorcism), and his tactics—rhetorical digs, the question-mark stroke—align with it. Interiority is specific to his vocation and methods, though contradictory impulses (fear vs. vocation) remain muted rather than dramatized in collision. The felt cost is mostly conceptual (solitude, emptied palette), not deeply emotional. Still, micro-choices under pressure read coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority and embodied motive: she is driven by “chronological homesickness” to conduct memory as music. Micro-choices under pressure (the ritual with the shell, pushing past the “before exhaustion hits” rule, selecting the father’s melody) reveal values and cost. Contradictory impulses (reverence for silence vs. urge to break it; rule vs. transgression) act simultaneously. The endurance ending reads earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, compelling motivation (integration over escape) drives concrete micro-choices—stepping into the room, touching landings, choosing a “third path,” and finally speaking confessions. Interiority is particular and embodied (“bare feet hovering,” “runes grown like roots”). Contradictory impulses surface credibly: a poised defier who admits fear and unworthiness. The change at the end—merging echoes at personal cost—feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s fear of losing the “filament of hush” motivates concrete choices (rigging the broken needle, insisting on tactile listening). Her interiority is embodied and specific (dust motes, spine vibrations), and the shift from control to provocation is earned. The final renunciation of fear (carrying the void as potential) feels credible and paid for. Secondary characters are textured only as a chorus, not a crucible, slightly limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s meticulousness and integrity are dramatized through concrete habits (field journal, barometer, cache) and a live moral pivot (refusing to report, choosing lateral investigation). The solitude vs. action contradiction lands cleanly (“Solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it”). Emotions are embodied via sensory attention (damp earth, wind bell) rather than labels. Minor note: the internal risk calculus could show one sharper pang of cost beyond implied danger.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she comes to grieve lost perfumes and to face the question of scent‑triggered tears. Contradictory impulses—lifelong caution vs. daring to open the vial—act simultaneously and culminate in a credible change. Micro‑choices (unscrewing with “trembling precision,” deploying the UV lamp) reveal values under pressure. Slightly declarative thesis lines (“Smells bypass thought…”) skim the edge of over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s motivation (“to discover the texture of time”) is embodied in tactile, idiosyncratic behavior (tracing frays, spiraling the rope, humming), and her choice to leave the rope behind reads as a credible renunciation. Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than label‑driven. The ethical playfulness manifests in offering “texture” over answers, though the felt cost remains modest. Contradictory impulses (seeking meaning vs. refusing judgment) coexist but rarely collide under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is crystalline and embodied through action (playing as unbinding), with tactile micro‑choices (kneeling in moss, calibrating to the bowl) that align with her aim. Interiority is rendered via acoustic perception rather than abstract labeling, which keeps her individuality sharp. The relationship with the child offers a light crucible and a human cost vector, though internal contradiction is minimal. The endurance/renunciation stance at the end reads earned but not overtly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vael’s interiority is embodied and particular—the static crawling her arms, the “affectionate detachment”—and her renunciation reads as a motivated extension of long‑standing professional detachment reconfigured into care. The contradiction between dealer and conduit is dramatized through tactile choices (pressing the petal to her sternum; smashing vials). If there’s a slip, it’s a touch of neatness in how swiftly the insight coheres. Still, the costed choice to destroy her wares and accept social ruin earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive is clear and character‑particular, and his shrewdness filtered through tenderness reads specific. Interiority is present but largely unopposed—he encounters little friction, so contradictory impulses rarely surface beyond “cautious exuberance.” His actions align with his values and reveal him well, yet the arc pays a relatively small on‑page cost. The anonymity choice carries meaning but not a pressurized dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s longing for belonging is concrete and drives each choice (embedding clues in sculptures, following the note, dedicating her name). Interiority is specific to her craft—braiding loneliness into bridges—rather than generic. Internal contradiction (aching solitude vs. deliberate myth‑making) is present but under-pressured. The cost at closure reads more as surrender of isolation than a hard trade‑off, keeping this just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is precise and active from the first line—find the place where echoes are born—and her choices (overborrowing, cushioning the chime, midwifing echoes) track cleanly. Interiority is embodied (fatigue, heat of the pendant) with credible stress responses. Internal contradiction (panic vs. trained clarity) appears but isn’t deeply mined for moral cost. The ending’s renunciation—pocketing the pendant and stopping—reads earned if a touch easy emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motive—comprehension over reunion—feels specific and drives concrete micro‑choices (aligning the eyes, whispering integrals, leaving one eye, going deeper). Interiority is rich and embodied through tactile interaction with the orchard and mosaic. The contradictory pull between grief and cautious hope is present but could sharpen under pressure for a higher band. The final renunciation (leaving the hazel eye) reads as a modest but earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—dust, oxide, warmth—grounding her motive to resist erasure. Micro‑choices (what to return, where to place it) reveal a hierarchy of values under quiet pressure. The internal contradiction (yearning for visibility vs. remaining unseen) is credible and carried to an earned refusal. Slight softness: her flaw set stays safely benevolent, limiting sharper friction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied—her tremor at the clippers is a live contradiction between scientific habit and emergent kinship. Motivation escalates credibly from curiosity to renunciation with visible cost (tearing out notes, abandoning measures). The choice to belong rather than dissect is earned. Slight idealization of the turn toward mysticism keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and particular: insomnia, the rain‑trail habit, the self‑check against calling it magic reveal a credible, contradictory psyche. Her micro‑choices—pinning the brooch, whispering apologies, electing to trade art for rest—align with a desperate drive for resonance. The cost is legible: she relinquishes the brooch and a painting, accepting an earned stasis. Minor hedge: the explicit articulation of her aim (“to thresh meaning…”) edges toward statement rather than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The clairvoyant’s motives (to magnify everyday magic) and contradictions (aversion to using the pearl vs. compulsion under pressure) are clear and dramatized. Her interiority is embodied through tactile cues—the warm pearl, tremor, bone‑deep thrum. The pilgrim’s presence applies pressure without stealing focus, and their dynamic evolves credibly. The final shift—accepting the unseen as integral—reads earned, though the on‑page cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s motives and methods are clear and coherent, with embodied specificity (salt on shawl, handle of the valve) revealing temperament. Her agency culminates in proposing the rite rather than seeking memorials, an earned renunciation with conceptual cost. Internal contradiction is muted—she’s preternaturally composed and competent—so pressure on her psyche remains low. Still, micro-choices (listening, cross-referencing, refusing statues) reveal a distinct hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s motivation and method are crisp and character‑particular, and her micro‑choices (kneeling, pressing the punch, absorbing the whispers) align with her analytic artistry. The inherited tool and the Nocturne Line backstory enrich interiority without stalling. However, internal contradiction is muted; the hesitation reads as reverence more than a live tug‑of‑war, so the peak choice carries less ambivalence than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s “sympathetic skeptic” stance drives concrete choices—touching the tile, allowing sensation to guide her hand, and finally archiving the score for wanderers rather than scholars. The internal contradiction (doubt vs. wonder) is enacted on the page, not merely stated. The renunciation of solving the mystery reads as an earned endurance with a conceptual cost (giving up mastery/fame). Slight softness remains around acute pressure or credible error under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: boredom refined into a reverent hunt for “what happens after goodbye.” Actions align (waiting centuries, calibrating to the storm, stepping through) and reveal values. Internal contradiction is light—he moves steadily from ennui to wonder without much resistance—but the final renunciation of his refuge registers as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    The child’s motive—seeking the “mathematics of fair trade” to counter a con upbringing—is distinct and sustained, with embodied micro-choices (timing footsteps, matching the hum) under pressure. The theft for an ethical end shows credible contradiction without dissolving into neat virtue. The mortician scene adds relational pressure and status dynamics that the child navigates with earned steadiness. The closing choice to approach the father with a pen, not force, feels motivated and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—she collects temporal textures—and her actions (ear to the lamp, note-taking, cross‑referencing) align with that drive. The discovery of someone else’s history triggers a credible reorientation from solitary curation to communal invitation. Internal contradiction (studious control vs. relinquishing authorship) is present and earned. The emotional beats are embodied without therapy‑speak, though pressure remains gently scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—salvaging “texture” of erased lives—is specific and consistent, and his micro‑choices (not correcting the certificate, avoiding speech, sitting three tides by the shoe) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is concrete through object focus (satchel, poison label) rather than abstract self‑analysis. The cost—solitude, self‑erasure risk—registers, though internal contradiction could tighten (his refusal to engage living voices blunts sharper conflict). Strong but not transformative change; the ending is an earned stance rather than a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied through tactile rituals (shell to soundboard, hums up the arms), with a credible contradiction between compulsive seeking and the renunciation at the end. Micro-choices under pressure read cleanly (recasting the argument; placing the shell; accepting the compass’s verdict). The final endurance choice forecloses a path (stop seeking answers in ghosts) with visible cost (relics break, a vocation repurposed). No therapy-speak; emotions are specific and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motive—salvage through reorganization—drives concrete choices, and her dual allegiance registers as a live tension throughout. Interiority is specific (mapping chaos, aligning glyphs with moon phases) and embodied via the foundation chip’s warmth. Her choice to paint the city-spanning mural rather than confront City Hall reads as an earned renunciation. Cost is present but mostly conceptual (postponement, not victory), keeping this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is crisp and embodied: she chooses to climb, kneel, photograph, wait, and label. The vigil reframes her initial goal from documentation to communion, an earned renunciation. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—duty versus elegy—skewing more toward serene acceptance than friction. A slightly deeper on‑page cost beyond elegiac ache could heighten the change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are vivid and character‑specific, with tactile interiority grounded in method. However, she meets little credible resistance; there’s scant internal contradiction or cost beyond time pressure. The botanist exerts minimal on‑page pressure, so relationships don’t crucible the choice. The ending’s endurance reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong, particular interiority and vocation-driven motive (“editing out empires to reveal aquifers”) make the narrator vivid. His dry wit and competent ritualized method read consistent, and small micro-choices (which translation to whisper, refusing spectacle, drawing a spiral) align with motive. Internal contradiction is subtle—precision versus yearning—landing in a credible endurance/renunciation at the end. The arc is quiet rather than contested, with limited on‑page friction beyond environment and patience.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Her motive—rebalancing rather than resurrecting—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (where to step, when to stop, to leave the fork) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she reads as serenely competent with little friction or error. The cost is present but light (relinquishing the fork, dissolving into the town’s pulse). Strong singularity of purpose, limited contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elira’s motive (revelation over rescue) is clear and pressure-tested; her contradictory impulses—panic urging flight vs. willful stillness—are dramatized as she keeps the vial open. Micro-choices (unscrewing, not resealing despite alarms) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (accepting death) feels earned and costly. Interiority remains embodied and specific to her sonic-archaeologist lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crisply framed (“not for redemption — to thread a labyrinth with his own story”) and every choice aligns with it, culminating in sealing the voices into the lens. Interiority is embodied through tactile, sensory specifics (rust, brine, candle wax) rather than labels. The internal conflict is understated—he’s largely resolved—so contradiction is muted, but the legacy of mistrust adds credible pressure. The final renunciation of credibility (“They’d call him mad”) lands as a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is lucid (repay a debt across lifetimes), and the ghost bride’s devotion-as-vengeance gives her choices bite; Elara’s moment of acceptance adds a second, if slimmer, arc. Interiority is mostly implied through image rather than thought, limiting contradiction-on-the-page. The visible cost—the bride’s dissolution into the system—is earned. Slight distance from Elara’s internal struggle keeps this shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—she defies guild/family precedent to mend the plate, stitching memory into stone. Interiority is vivid and particular to her craft; micro-choices (threading, where to sew, refusing to stop) reveal values. Internal contradiction is limited—she’s steady rather than torn—so cost reads as endurance more than conflict. Still, the choice to persist against erasure lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore orientation and faith—reads consistent and actionable, and her “listening” approach yields concrete micro‑choices (excavate, re‑align, re‑carve). Interiority is particular and embodied (“petals fell upward”; roots steadying her wrists). However, internal contradiction is limited; she faces little competing impulse beyond patience versus haste, so the arc leans toward steady competence. The endurance/change is credible but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, particular motive (the lost letter) and a lived praxis produce a coherent, idiosyncratic character. Interiority is embodied through tactile routines (chalk, cedar pencils, brass chutes) rather than label-speak. However, contradictory impulses in-scene are muted; she does not face a live micro‑choice that exposes a sharper value trade. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—she listens for “unheard stories” and acts decisively when the flame trembles. Interiority is particular and embodied through craft gestures and breath with the candle. Limited contradiction: she’s steady under pressure, with little on‑page ambivalence beyond the strategic “foolishness” disguise. Relationship pressure is off‑stage; her solitude trims some complexity but keeps focus taut.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks “the moment before deciding”—and her micro‑choices (smudging “afraid” into “alive,” placing the letters, releasing the shard) reveal contradictory impulses of withholding vs release. Embodied emotion is strong (salt, wounds, trembling) and not merely labeled. The change at the end (choosing a new path, surrendering letters/shard) reads earned with a felt cost. Slight abstraction at times blunts the sharpness of her internal conflict in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motives are clear and particular—translating fear into witness—and her micro‑choices (kneeling to read, speaking the phrases, pressing coral to cast) align with her profession and flaws. Interiority is embodied (“anesthetic... weighting her limbs”) and specific to her translator’s ethic. The final renunciation (not fixing, but letting it breathe) feels earned with felt cost. Slight safety in articulation (“she hadn’t healed the past”) trims the edge of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira’s motives and contradictions (acclaim/expectation versus unguarded joy) are clear and drive concrete choices: seeking elders, building the apparatus, choosing resonance over preservation. Her embodied reactions—laughing fully, pocketing the shard as “a key”—mark an earned internal shift. Minor softness remains in how much cost is felt versus stated.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motive (curiosity over preservation) is concrete and drives micro-choices: inviting rather than commanding, discovering reflection, and pressing the nickel in. The internal contradiction—restorer vs. desire to be un-fixed—surfaces credibly at the pivot. Embodied responses (pressure-waves as memory, taste, terror) avoid abstraction. Slight softness: conflict is mostly surrender rather than struggle, so the price is subtle rather than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, compelling motivation (protecting banned language) drives concrete choices, and the Basque fine grounds her stance. The relationship beat with Dr. Vex creates a subtle crucible where status and allegiance shift. Internal contradiction is light—she’s assured more than torn—so cost reads more conceptual than felt. Still, her “candidly cryptic” tactics reveal character under pressure in distinct, embodied ways.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) drives consistent choices (refusing pilgrims, singing to the wind). The contradiction “shyly unstoppable” is dramatized rather than labeled, especially at dawn climbs versus flinching from applause. Emotional texture is embodied through tactile rituals (pressing the postcard to sternum/shell). The closing recommitment reads as an earned endurance with cost (persistent insomnia and chosen solitude).

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation and practice anchor her character; the grandmother’s belief about the crack deepens lineage and duty. Interiority is embodied through tactile tending and listening rather than labels. However, on‑page contradictory impulses are mostly historicized (others’ failures) rather than tested in her present beat, keeping conflict largely implicit. The Earned Stasis at the end feels credible, if quiet, with minimal on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular: a linguist driven to repair trust after the Silence, embodied in meticulous, oath‑aware method. The “carefully reckless” contradiction is dramatized (fist‑pump, then triple verification). Micro‑choices under pressure (warning the choir, tuning phonemes) align with her values. The curator’s caution adds relational pressure without derailing her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular—harmonizing control and mercy—and embodied through tactile choices (chain alignment, humming, covert copying). The “slyly heartfelt” method creates credible internal contradiction (competence vs. subversive compassion). Emotional texture feels lived (trembles, warmth of stone), not labeled. Cost is hinted (overseers, children downstream), though not stress‑tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive—preserving lost songs—drives concrete choices (training, redesigning harnesses, embedding the chip). Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) surface around the meteorite and culminate in a vulnerable renunciation: she stops reinventing herself. Embodied action (calloused fingers, ritual tasks) grounds her interiority. Minor note: relational crucible is largely absent, so pressure is mostly internal.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—testing “necessary distances” to find her father—drives every beat and culminates in a costly choice. Interiority is specific (grain-as-chronology; grief fossilized), with action aligned to motive (decoding via wood, stepping off). Contradiction (loss/fear vs. “featherly determination”) is present but lightly dramatized rather than stress‑tested by on‑page resistance. The final renunciation reads earned, if a touch insulated by lyric remove.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she descends seeking “the rhythm of belonging,” and her micro‑choices (pressing her palm to the glass, mirroring the open hand) align with that desire. Interiority is vivid and body‑anchored, though internal contradiction is mild (solitude is embraced more than contested). The feather as a tool externalizes her sensitivity without tipping into label‑speak. The change—alone to no longer lonely—reads earned but at a gentle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, particular interiority and embodied action (pressing seeds to skin, murmuring syllables) motivate the pursuit. The pivot from “solve” to “carry” feels earned through contact with the crater glass. Contradictory impulses (delight inside loss) are present but lightly tested. The visible cost is conceptual—renouncing certainty—credible at this length but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation and method are crystalline and character‑specific, and his micro‑choices (waiting for the moon cue, refusing to touch the bishop) reveal a coherent value system. Interiority is largely inferred through action and diction rather than deep internal conflict, so contradictory impulses are muted. The audience mini‑arcs reflect him well without forcing relationship stakes. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stance, though the on‑page cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, embodied motive—preserve outlawed memory by dancing a verse into her body—drives concrete choices (pressing the moonstone to skin, dancing through pain, accepting the child’s request). Interiority is vivid and character‑specific, if largely assured rather than conflicted. Some contradiction (rebellion vs. solitude; fear vs. compulsion) is implied but not stressed in-scene. The visible cost (blood, exhaustion) credibly earns the closing pivot to teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV interiority is specific and embodied (calloused fingers, knees protesting), with consistent motive—consecrating the mundane—driving small but coherent choices (stone drop, prism delivery). Internal contradiction is muted; he is serenely competent rather than pressured, so cost reads gentle rather than contentious. The father memory deepens character without hijacking the present. Closing renunciation/endurance is credible but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied: he walks the ridge to “bargain innocence back from the ashes,” then reads and answers the children’s letters. Interiority is textured with contradictions—fear acknowledged alongside commitment (“Yes. I’m afraid. And that’s why I stay.”). Micro‑choices (unlatching the box, reading aloud to wind and stars, leaving his own note) reveal values with visible cost. A few aphoristic lines skim abstraction, but the scars, knees, and ember‑kisses keep him particular.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is distinct and consistent—she aims to “revitalize…the equations that governed possibility”—and her actions align (patterns, launches, recalibration). Interiority is conveyed through precise, character‑specific perception (“probability of grace under temporal duress”). However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely strains against herself. The endurance at the end reads earned but low-cost, more serene commitment than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear motive and a distinctive occupational lens yield embodied choices—listening with her palm, choosing to witness rather than extract, refusing to capture the glowing negative. The interiority is particular (“the hollow behind her ribs”) and consistent. Internal contradiction is subtle (yearning to record vs. electing to leave her sketch), but it’s present and costs her something. A relationship crucible is absent, but not required at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation is legible (return the borrowed heartbeat; coax mirrors into possibility), and actions align. Interiority is mostly projected through image rather than conflicted thought, yielding limited on‑page contradiction. The “perceptively calm” stance fits but softens pressure. Still, embodied micro‑choices (palm to stone, hums the code, refusal to linger) read true.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motive—returning after failures to bind peace through ceremony—is concrete and consistent, with credible endurance as the final stance. Interiority is specific (ink, bone pen, etched failures) and tied to embodied action. Internal contradiction (frayed conviction vs. relentless return) is present without melodrama. The survivors are more tableau than interlocutors, so relational pressure remains limited.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradiction—“amoral philanthropist” with a private atonement—drives every choice, culminating in the ritualized non-act of leaving the egg. Interiority is specific and embodied (salt crunch, breath, recalled recording), not label-speak. The renunciation (not resurrecting, not retrieving) forecloses paths with cost. Minor hedge: pressure is almost entirely internal, but it remains credible and live.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear (resonance over obedience), and micro‑choices under pressure appear in the patient thread‑work and the whispered “I remember you.” Internal contradiction is subtler—“chaste courtesan” hints at tension, but on‑page conflict mostly reads as serene competence, not contested impulse. Actions align with her ethos and culminate in Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a conceptual cost (defying the lullaby, choosing solitude as armor). A deeper embodiment of fear or doubt at the final knot could raise the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, coherent interiority with a credible flaw-to-intention arc: from aesthetic evasion to accountable artistry. The veteran’s bottle and the non‑flinch reveal value hierarchy; the final plan to return to Mira with a new show lands as a micro‑choice with cost. Some moments state motive outright rather than dramatize it (“You make poison look like calligraphy”), reducing contradiction on the page. Still, the puppet self and the stick-as-compass concretize growth without safety‑hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied in micro‑choices: she builds, places the wing, refuses to touch the descending monarch. The paradox “transiently rooted” is dramatized rather than told through the tender, easily unraveled knots. Emotional texture remains concrete (dew, moss, trembling fingers) rather than abstract. The arc is an earned endurance/renunciation with visible cost: beauty without audience and letting the shrine dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is crystalline and enacted through concrete craft choices, and the narrator’s embodied tenderness (“technically gentle”) reads as character‑particular. Internal conflict is quieter—atonement already achieved—so tension hinges on patience and care rather than a live contradiction. The renunciation (no signature; unraveling the rope) lands as a credible cost. A sharper on‑page tug between preservation and desecration would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑particular, and her “precisely playful” method under pressure (the calibrated steps, the wrist twist) reveals her. The internal shift from foresight/hindsight bondage to “living now” is earned by the dream excavation. However, contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page; the realization feels a touch unopposed. Emotional cost registers conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied through concrete sacrifices (sold cloak, scant food) and meticulous choices (alignment, logging). The interior paradox—empirical rigor pursuing “magic”—gives him specificity without posturing. Internal conflict is subtle rather than dramatized under pressure; he endures more than he wrestles. The Earned Stasis at the end (preserving, not exploiting) reads motivated and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich, embodied interiority with a credible duality—cunning pacifist vs. housed rage—drives micro‑choices (mapping tension, reframing the pin) toward a renunciatory shift. The relinquishment of dependence on the box reads as a costed change. A touch of explanatory phrasing (“This was the lesson…”) slightly flattens mystery but doesn’t undercut motivation. The throughline from conviction to tactic to transformed stance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation and embodied craft details ground her choices; the breath counts and tool use feel earned. Internal contradiction is light—competence outweighs struggle—so tension is mostly reverent rather than conflicted. Her history as “once that child” adds nuance without overexplaining. The final act (pressing obsidian to the dream) aligns with her ethos and forecloses a path (this will be her final craft).

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied: she gathers and mends vows to reach her daughter, refusing “redemption” in favor of “repair.” Contradictory impulses tangle credibly—her pragmatism versus aching tenderness—most vivid when she pockets other people’s failed promises as both evidence and confession. Micro-choices (honey-coaxing, stitching vow to ribbon, sleeping with it in her fist) reveal values under pressure. The felt cost—professional exile and ongoing estrangement—grounds the persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive (“forbidden knowledge” pressed by the Archive’s silence) drive concrete micro-choices: entering the bathroom, inquiring, touching the petal. The “bewildered” stance evolves credibly to “awake,” with conceptual cost (“second skeleton” of disquiet). Internal contradiction (curiosity vs. institutional taboo/fear) is present but not strongly contested by a counterforce on the page. Epiphany arrives quickly yet is grounded by prior cues (gaps between pages, cameo handling, bathroom method).

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motivation and method are clear and consistent—she’s a listener-scholar whose choices (listening to Kael’s “dislocated verbs,” offering the diary, refusing extraction) drive the turn. The relationship dynamic with Kael adds pressure and contrast (extraction vs. reconciliation) without melodrama. Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, which slightly softens felt cost. The implied renunciation—becoming part of the library rather than “saving” it—lands but could bear a sharper on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction is vivid and specific: the fused twin selves yearn to recover a name while fearing fracture (“Would that self still fit inside her skin?”). Micro‑choices under pressure track cleanly (following the card, inviting reflections, choosing to take Lirien). Emotions are embodied via sensory anchors (copper and cinnamon, oil constellations) and the twin status informs perception without label‑speak. The final acceptance (“I am both… And all.”) is earned and carries a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is lucid and consistently enacted: she solves anomalies through patience and precision. Interiority feels particular (archivist’s perceptual bias toward objects, patterns), with micro‑choices in the braid‑work. Conflict is low and competence is high, so struggle reads gentle rather than pressured. The final renunciation (door no longer needed) lands as earned stasis with modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ripple-mark’s motive (to conjure silence rather than flee) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—calibrating pitch, tracing fissures, offering the stone—align with that drive. Interiority is implied through tactile attention rather than explored in contradiction, so we don’t feel much internal friction under pressure. Competence carries the scene with minimal visible cost beyond relinquishing the gathered hush. Strong presence, limited complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks meaning rather than mourning—and her micro‑choices (precise alignment, holding breath, final whisper) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is embodied through setting (“honey‑thick air,” glass moan) rather than label-speak. The arc lands as a credible endurance/renunciation: she accepts the role of conduit with care for a fragile rekindling. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is gentle; doubt versus conviction doesn’t grind hard on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority with credible contradictions (“preemptively nostalgic” for cultures and her own erasure) and micro-choices that reveal values (measuring by empathy, signing in a raindrop’s refraction, not looking back). Motivation is consistent and embodied in method. The cost is conceptual but felt—accepting her future disappearance as part of the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motive—defying a starless hopelessness through craft—is concrete and consistent, embodied in chant, footwork, and the final relinquishing of the rag. Interiority is conveyed via sensory filtering and occupational lexicon rather than labels. Contradictory impulses are muted; she’s mostly steady, competent resolve. The final renunciation (laying down the kerosene knot) lands as a credible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the chronicler’s tactile noticing and micro‑choices (placing and later pocketing the jade cicada, inviting deferral) reveal character. The relationship pressure is credible, with his arrival functioning as a crucible that reconfigures her stance. The cost is quiet—refusing decision—so the change reads as Earned Stasis rather than decisive turn. A touch more contradiction-in-action under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is vivid and character‑particular: hunger for “flavors of silence” drives concrete choices (clutching the doll, climbing, refusing return). Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and the doll as crucible. The renunciation at the end (foregoing the bunker’s “security”) reads earned, with a felt cost. Slight neatness in the final realization (“They understood then…”) trims some ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The operator’s vocation, tactility, and micro-choices (tilting toward chime‑trees, breath pacing, storm glass reading) render a specific, credible psyche. Motivation is clear and consistent, and the woman’s embodied shift (shoulders drop, tear) registers as earned. Internal contradiction is minimal—he’s serenely competent—so pressure never forces a morally costly trade. Still, the relationship dynamic reads precise and human without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear goal and consistent “wisely adventurous” temperament guide concrete micro‑choices (peeling paint, using the flake, descending). Interiority is tactile but relatively safe; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal, so struggle reads more competent than conflicted. The final choice is earned but its cost is conceptual rather than felt in a wound or loss of relationship. Strong specificity in embodied perception supports character but depth of inner conflict could be richer.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motive (teaching breath after absence) drives each micro‑choice, and the refusal to knock reads as a principled renunciation with cost. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (cold ring, ash, scars). The character’s contradictions—tenderness paired with ruthless silence—are present in scene action. Slight abstraction in biography limits the fullness of lived specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s history (pyramid scheme survivor) and present stance (spite-fueled volunteering) align cleanly with her peak choice to “translate pressure.” Interiority is particular—credit card debt, ruined friendships, the bolt as totem—giving her action emotional charge. The contradiction (distrustful yet willing to anchor) reads credible. Slightly summary‑led setup trims some lived friction before the convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character‑specific motive and method; her discipline of listening and bodily attunement reads particular and credible. Limited contradiction under pressure—she faces little on‑page resistance once the recording begins. The final stance shift (ender → restorer) is earned but the felt cost is mostly conceptual. Micro‑choices are few beyond the deliberate pacing and the decision to play and then to go.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he seeks to “capture the shape of possibility” and keeps allegiance to the threshold. Interiority is embodied through ritualized movement rather than discursive thought, which works but limits visible contradiction. The renunciation (unsnapping, surrendering control) reads as earned by prior traits. Cost is implied (identity/armor relinquished) more than palpably dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich, particular interiority and tactile micro‑choices (gloves, lamp angle, photographing dust) reveal a focused, wounded professional. Motivation evolves credibly from preservation of loss to “Magnifications” without a tidy miracle cure; sorrow remains. The archivist’s agency drives every beat, with a subtle but felt cost in choosing to live inside institutional pain. Minor softness comes from the near-frictionless adoption of the new practice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motivation and competence are crisp and consistent, and her micro‑tactics (puddle maps, analog rewiring) reveal character under pressure. However, she faces little internal contradiction; the piece leans on steadiness over ambivalence. Embodied detail lands (“water cool as forgotten truth”), but emotional texture remains mostly declarative. The endurance/renunciation cost is light, skewing toward competence fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation is clear and character-particular: he comes to hush a prophecy tied to family (grandmother’s lullaby, father’s tombstone). Interiority is embodied through technique choices (shifting embouchure, playing absence), translating fear and grief into action. Internal contradiction is subtle but present—terror into tenderness—though not deeply dramatized as competing impulses. The cost is quiet and credible: solitude, no fanfare, and a burden inherited and discharged.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motive—decoding the arbor’s messages—and her ritualized compassion read specific and consistent, with agency at key moments (prodding the speck; revising her monuments). Interiority comes via tactile practice rather than abstract labels. The piece lacks a strong internal contradiction or costly trade‑off, so change skews reverent expansion rather than struggle. Still, her choices credibly drive the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s drive—to interrogate failure and control—grounds every choice, then credibly inverts into a renunciation. His contradictory impulses (order vs. uncertainty) are dramatized in tactile acts, especially tossing his father’s watch. Micro‑choices (calipers, screwdriver from a metronome, following the humming) reveal character under pressure. The change forecloses a life of certainty with visible cost and a new ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive—atonement through naming—drives every micro‑choice, and her refusal to stop when the coin cracks reveals a credible contradiction between “balance” and mercy. Interiority is embodied (tools, heat, rain) rather than abstract. The renunciation of “Elara the Even” for “the Mended” reads earned by prior action. Slight directness in self‑assessment trims the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive (“not to banish… but to pursue”) drive concrete micro‑choices—the flute to harmonize rather than overpower, the foolish trill to risk levity. Embodied emotion shows in tactile anchors (tooth warmth, “luminous ache”). A modest internal contradiction (fear alongside chosen tenderness) is present, though her flaw set is gentled and rarely pressures a costly choice. The endurance at the end reads earned, if not harrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Singular, embodied interiority grounds the piece; the survivor’s tactile relationship to pain (“proprioceptively enhanced”) reads specific rather than generic. Micro‑choices—following the light corridor, whispering the answer, offering the strap—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The contradiction between bracing against pain and bracing against revelation provides live tension. Slight softening: antagonistic pressure is mostly environmental, so relational crucible is absent by design.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear motive and embodied past—bare feet recalling rope burns, paying with a grandmother’s memory—drive concrete choices. Contradictory impulses are subtle rather than dramatized; the narrator rarely hesitates under pressure. Relationship dynamics (with Mara and the historian) add texture but don’t force hard trade‑offs on the page. Still, the actions align tightly with values and reveal character through tactility and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clean and character‑particular: he’s there to witness, not fix, and his micro‑choices (angling the barrel, prying the tile, bagging artifacts, the whispered “I see you”) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile attention and occupational detail rather than abstract feeling. The “responsibility, not guilt” stance evolves credibly into a practiced ritual of care. Cost is quiet but felt—he assumes stewardship—though resistance is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and idiosyncratic—she wants to compress eternity—and her choices (uncorking the whisper, selecting the mother’s moment) align under escalating pressure. Embodied emotion is present but understated; interior contradiction is hinted (order-keeper vs. chaos midwife) rather than deeply dramatized. The maternal choice adds personal cost and specificity. A touch more visceral, conflicted interiority at the peak would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—the shard as “a rosary of regrets” nails his state. Motivation evolves credibly from failed insurgency to translator of a lost social grammar. Micro‑choices (covering mirrors, accepting Voss, transcribing poems) reveal values under pressure. The shift reads earned with felt cost: renouncing the old war for a quieter, riskier one.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, specific interiority anchored in tactile craft and guilt; the wilt near his chest ties motivation to action. His choice to sing rather than tinker reveals values under pressure and earns the moral turn. Minor softness: the redemption lands smoothly with little residue of ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira’s motive is crystalline and embodied—she tastes the lagoon, licks the journal, and offers the compass—revealing a specific hierarchy of values. The psychometry sequence grounds her interiority in concrete sensation rather than label-speak. However, internal contradiction is light; she seldom struggles against a counter-impulse, so the change reads as deepening rather than contested. The final renunciation carries cost but not a hard wrestle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (salvage → meaning) are clear, embodied, and deepen under pressure from storm and career demands. Contradictory impulses—monetization vs. communal making—coexist on the page and are resolved by a credible renunciation (leaving the piece unclaimed, walking inland to teach). Her micro-choices (lighting the slide, carving an arch-within-arch, projecting) reveal values through action. Cost is present though conceptual rather than bodily.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Her motive—to reckon with why flowers bloom at night—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (traveling, decoding glass, repainting). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific rather than generic. The arc lands as an earned endurance/surrender rather than a flip epiphany, with a felt cost (“heart heavier with purpose,” sleepless nights). Limited visible contradiction keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, specific motivation (preserve silenced voices; “truth in tension”) drives concrete choices—failed whispers, debris‑liturgy, renouncing sterile reports. Embodied beats (barefoot grit, tears cutting salt) ground emotion. Internal tension (institutional method vs. surrendered listening) is credible though not deeply dramatized in a single high‑pressure confrontation. Change/renunciation carries cost (insomnia, binding as witness) and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist’s motives are clear and consistent—refuse nostalgia, pursue reinvention—and his key micro‑choice (giving the bottle to the child) tracks with his ethos. Interiority is textured without therapy‑speak, but we seldom feel contradictory impulses under pressure; he rarely wavers. Secondary characters apply soft, observational pressure rather than forcing fraught choices. The endurance/renunciation cost (relinquishing ownership, accepting solitude) is present but understated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motive—preservation—shifts credibly to awakening after the childhood prophecy resurfaces, and her micro‑choices (playing the cylinder, speaking dead tongues, releasing petals) align with that arc. Interiority is embodied via ritual and sensory detail rather than label‑speak. The internal conflict (archivist vs activator) is present but gentle; the cost is mostly conceptual, not sharply dramatized. Still, her final commitment reads earned and specific to her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (preserve life/time) is clear and embodied by specific micro-choices (lifting the acorn cap; pressing it into the dais; whispering seed names). “Furiously tranquil” gives a credible inner contradiction that colors her actions. The cost is more conceptual (letting go, consenting to return differently) than dramatized, softening the felt price. Depth of struggle is modest, but consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation—she vows to “favor listening over noise”—and her restraint under pressure reads as an earned renunciation. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with the rope and sensors rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (mistrust of sirens vs. urge to warn), but the piece leans more on steadiness than struggle. The final endurance choice (letting the sky ring) feels credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Coherent, specific interiority and motive (honoring endings; “empathy was his compass”) drive every micro‑choice. The past at the Archive and transfer “downward” supply credible history and cost. Internal contradiction is minimal—he’s largely aligned—so pressure never forces him into a wrenching trade‑off. Nonetheless, embodied emotion (kneeling, tears, broom as benediction) keeps him vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The recluse’s motive—honoring a covenant by preserving the unsaid—holds steady and compels endurance choices (refusing to open the box, shielding it in storms). Interiority is conveyed through precise attentional habits rather than abstract labels. The arc is an earned stasis with felt cost, though internal contradiction is subdued (temptation vs. duty is implied more than dramatized). Absence of a second, pressuring on‑page character limits relational crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vey’s interiority is specific (heartbeat unmoored, bureaucrat of seconds) and their actions align with motive, culminating in a credible shift to “curating echoes.” However, internal contradiction under pressure is lightly sketched; Lira catalyzes change without sustained interpersonal friction that would force harder choices. The relationship is evocative but low-conflict, limiting visible cost. Still, the final renunciation of counting seconds reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motive—tending the incomplete—translates cleanly into concrete choices (present attention, weaving a new kite, refusing repair). Interiority is embodied through tactile attention and sound (humming), not labels. The relationship with the boy is delicately staged and shifts him credibly from hollow to curious. Minor limitation: little internal contradiction or cost for Elira beyond time and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen’s motivation—creating a living monument to interspecies respect before he dies—is clear and consistently embodied in action. The “gently systematic” untangling of the fledgling and the ritual of tying up the diary reveal priorities under pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; he’s serenely resolved, so the arc leans toward Earned Stasis rather than a change. Secondary characters (villagers) apply light, supportive pressure rather than testing him.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority anchors her motive and contradictions (skepticism vs. pilgrimage). Micro-choices—ascending, placing the amber, then leaving it—align with her drive. The emotional shift to “part of the reaction” reads earned, with the quiet cost of forfeiting the lab’s certainties. Pressure remains largely inward, but it’s credible at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is lucid and embodied—restoration via “submerged concord” drives every micro‑choice from crushing pods to mixing ash. The coachman’s interiority is conveyed through tactile ritual and bird‑spoken cues rather than exposition. Contradictory impulses are subtle (patience vs. urgency; grief vs. repair) but present in the kneeling/listening restraint before action. The endurance choice at the end (return tomorrow) reads as earned stasis with a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Bracken’s motives are clear and character‑particular (from body‑finder to keeper of voices), and his choices (leading the expedition, dedicating nights to decoding) align with them. Interiority is embodied through scent and tactile engagement with the leaf and grooves. Internal contradiction is mild—less struggle than steady vocation—so the arc reads as renunciation/endurance more than contested change. The relationship to the lost handler lends authentic pressure without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she stays to convert confusion into exploration, rooted in family ritual. Interiority is specific (compass rose, grandmother’s advice) and embodied (mist on glass, pulsing applique). Micro‑choices—taking out the sketchbook, deciding to sketch the anomaly—reveal values. The internal contradiction (blessed vs. pariah; anchor vs. current) is present but lightly pressured rather than acutely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elric’s motive—amend rather than conquer—is clear, character‑particular, and embodied in his tactility and apologies while swapping pieces. “Cautious abandon” gives him a credible contradiction, though internal conflict never truly bites. Micro‑choices are present but largely unopposed, keeping cost modest. The ending’s reverent surrender reads earned but not harrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (to archive small gestures) and a credible arc from “crisis actor” to survivor. Actions (placing the pawnless board, patterned walking, refusing to bow) align with that drive. Internal contradiction is present but mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in sharp, in‑scene friction. Emotional texture is embodied in images more than in conflicted micro‑choices, tempering the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is textured and embodied, with clear motive (seeking the “shape of home”) and specific micro‑choices (feather to stone, stepping through the arch). The internal contradiction—seer who translates others versus refusing to translate herself until now—lands. However, opposition is gentle and the cost of arrival is mostly conceptual, softening pressure on the final choice. Still, her renunciation of endless translation in favor of belonging reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystal—self-forgiveness through pattern and consequence—and interiority is embodied (fidgeting, chess metaphors) without therapy-speak. Her flaw (ambition that broke a pupil) presses every choice and culminates credibly at the mirror. Contradictory impulses (drive for absolution vs. shame) operate simultaneously in scene. The renunciation—accepting exile and choosing to carry truth lightly—reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation (devotion to complexity; refusal to feed the spire a single story) drives concrete choices. Interiority is embodied (“charcoal smudged fingers,” the dream of glass birds) and contradictions register (mischief retooled as scalpel). The final renunciation—staying atop the tower and fracturing “I’m sorry”—is earned by prior sessions. Some cost remains abstract (social fallout with elders is implied more than felt).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied in micro‑choices—matching each pockmark to a buried wound and paying for it in gold and breath. The inner conflict (terror vs. vow to sanctify fracture) runs concurrently, not in tidy alternation. The final renunciation—choosing meaning over survival odds—reads earned and costly. Slightly limited range of contradictory impulses keeps it shy of absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and sustained: honoring a teenage vow when “the world stops making sense.” Micro‑choices (turning left, entering the cave, painting, leaving the shell, refusing the easel) align with her values under pressure. Interiority is embodied through tactile details (aching fingers, guttering candle) rather than label‑speak. Slightly limited contradiction on the page—she rarely wavers once committed—keeps it just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—she believes “whispers travel farther than shouts,” and her actions align with that credo. Embodiment is strong (blistered fingers, kneeling), and her micro‑choices (pressing the cork, continuing to “broadcast”) reveal values. Internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little friction beyond scale and fatigue. The change is a credible endurance/commitment rather than a reversal, with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rich, idiosyncratic interiority and embodied traits (moon‑tuned physiology, the censer hum settling behind her sternum) ground motive and micro‑choices. The arc from ignoring rhythm to honoring it—and the chosen practice of calling/singing—reads earned. Contradictory pulls (longing for coordinates vs. acceptance of silence) coexist without tidy resolution. Relationship pressure is minimal, but the unknown voice introduces a subtle crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation and interiority are specific and credible: she seeks “psychological safety” while burdened by involuntary truth. Micro‑choices—offering truffles, modulating speech “slant,” and relinquishing the eye—align with her values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (truth vs occlusion, self‑protection vs service) operate simultaneously. The only limiting factor is that external pressure is modest, so her struggle faces few hard tests.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motive—decoding the boutonnière—drives every choice with a distinct, embodied interiority (“the gap to speak”). The endurance to return nightly and the refusal to report at the end read as an Earned Stasis with a subtle cost. Internal contradiction is muted; he rarely wavers, which slightly limits dynamism. Still, his actions consistently reveal a precise, idiosyncratic psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority drives action from the map dealer’s empirically intuitive lens. Motivation (the vow to his sister and the “doorway of decisions”) is coherent and sustained. The main softness is limited internal friction—he moves from discovery to compliance with little resistance or cost-testing. Still, micro‑choices (trusting ants, stepping through, locking the shop) align with traits and feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The queen’s motives (answering the dream’s “invitation”) and flaw set (“power over pulse”) are dramatized through concrete choices—climbing barefoot, entering, then accepting renunciation. Interiority is embodied and specific (“linen that whispered… like regret,” tears forming constellations). The encounter with the hooded figure reveals credible contradiction—seeking truth while owning culpability. A minor softness: the figure articulates her flaw somewhat declaratively, trimming ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s motives and values are concrete and consistent, and her choices under pressure (ritualizing forgiveness, reframing guilt as pigment) read earned. Elias’s confession supplies credible relational pressure, though his interiority is thinner beyond guilt. Contradictory impulses are present but subtle (hurt vs. chosen presence), keeping the arc credible. The final renunciation/embrace forecloses blame as a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and self-contradictory (jealousy of past selves vs. present craft), with micro-choices under pressure (choosing to write the jealousy) that reshape the scene. The professional identity (“lucid dream chronicler”) grounds motive and tactics. The arc—accepting seams over “clean endings”—lands as a credible endurance/renunciation with cost. Secondary on‑page figures are internal doubles used effectively as pressure rather than props.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive (to reclaim meaning after anosmia) is concrete and consistent, and her micro-choices (bringing the screw, asking to mount it, bowing to the couple, placing the clock on her table) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is embodied through tactile and auditory focus, not labels. A slight neatness in Ren’s advisements (“You were never selling scent… you were selling presence”) trims ambiguity, keeping this just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motive—to reframe the pain of her scars—drives each micro‑choice (the decision to hum the lullaby, the disciplined pacing of the runes). Her interiority is embodied and particular (ink crystallizing under stress; wrist tingling; library dust and chamomile). The internal contradiction—scholarly rigor versus superstition—plays simultaneously rather than in tidy sequence. The change is an earned renunciation: scars remain, but shame’s shell is shed at visible cost (vulnerability and surrender).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motives drive her choices (apology, repair), and the embodied beats (boots, coil, manuscript) reveal complex remorse without tidiness. The relationship functions as crucible; power shifts when she activates the bottle and when he demands “truth.” Contradictory impulses (metaphor vs. truth; audacity vs. regret) are dramatized, not told. The final endurance—reconnection without embrace—reads as an earned, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority and motive (clarity over dominion) are strong and consistent, and the surrender at the end carries a credible cost (loss of self/language). However, pressure rarely forces contradictory impulses in scene—she barely wavers—so the arc reads serenely assured rather than contested. Micro-choices (selecting shelf, reciting the axiom, consenting to be read) do reveal values but don’t show real struggle. The earned renunciation still lands due to the price paid and prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular motivation and ritualized micro-choices (whistle, seven breaths, counter‑winding) reveal a singular mind under a precise obsession. Interiority is evocative and embodied (boots crunching, eyes watering), but internal contradiction is light—he rarely struggles, he affirms. The social pressure (“locals thought him mad”) adds texture but never tightens a relational crucible on the page. The Earned Stasis/renunciation at the end (leaving pistons dormant) carries modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interiority is specific and embodied (soil glow under her touch, the worn laser button), and her restraint around the “familiar strangers” reveals a principled, costly choice. The conflicting impulses—reach out vs. refuse to anchor by naming—play actively in scene. The final renunciation (allowing dissolution) reads earned by her history and methods. Minor abstraction creeps in at the end but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are coherent and particular: rebellion recalibrated by the father’s collapse into a responsibility-driven search for widened perspective. Micro‑choices—photographing scrawls, leaving replies, bringing the lantern to her father but withholding the subway secret—reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The gambler/professor parent split concretizes her internal contradiction without resorting to labels. The cost is subtle but present in her restraint and solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, idiosyncratic motivation (“cultivated estrangement”) drives concrete choices, and the final self-loop is an earned renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is more credo-driven than conflicted, but the act of patching herself to “silence” reveals contradiction—curator vs. participant. Embodied perception of the tunnel and the disc grounds emotion. A touch more on-the-spot doubt or falter under peak pressure would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is specific and embodied (preserving “small moments” via walnut ink), with micro-choices that reveal priorities (choosing not to weep so as not to blur ink; returning night after night). Internal conflict is quiet but real: grief-management through craft vs. the lure of spectacle or tears. The archivist’s occupational lens personalizes perception without drifting into label-speak. Change is an earned endurance/renunciation: committing to an ongoing, laborious witness in place of cathartic release.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—engineering reciprocity to treat loneliness—drives concrete choices (the table, chalkboard rule, final exchange). Her “desperately jocular” shell softens credibly at dusk into genuine vulnerability. Interiority is specific (field stories, satphone blinking) and actions align with her ethos. The internal contradiction is present, though not deeply stress‑tested beyond the final trade.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, idiosyncratic motive and embodied perception drive each choice; the renunciation of the ring reads as a credible cost. Internal contradiction is subtler—she “invites the ache” with little visible doubt—so struggle feels managed rather than contested. Still, her micro‑choices (kneeling to translate, stepping into silence, surrendering the ring) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The arc from absorbing to composing constitutes an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation and interior contradiction are vivid: she seeks to “thresh meaning” while embracing “confident uncertainty,” and her choice to invite edits rather than control them is character‑specific. Embodied actions—unscrewing the pen to listen, tracing the glyph, “unbending” assumptions—reveal values under pressure. The change reads as earned endurance/renunciation: relinquishing control for contingent revision. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it registers.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—becoming a vessel to “translate silence into music”—is specific and consistently embodied in gesture and choice. Contradictory impulses (joyful sorrow; the pact to be forgotten) register without tidy resolution. Relationships add pressure: Silas frames the cost and mirrors her motions; the girl’s arrival tests Elara’s credo. Minor limitation: Elara encounters little resistance beyond ethos, so struggle is more devotional than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, credible motive (rescue the promise) drives concrete micro‑choices—creating incomplete works, pressing her palm to the portrait. The destroyer/savior contradiction is present and animating without being over-explained. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with dust, ash, and glyphs. The visible cost is mostly conceptual (accepting criminality above vs. duty below), limiting the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Gamma-7’s need to resist imposed “peace” and transmute burden into creation is clear, embodied, and consistent. Contradictory impulses (yearning for quiet vs. refusing silencing) operate simultaneously and drive concrete micro‑choices (drumming instead of resting, entering the garden). The renunciation of pure individuality for collaborative identity lands as an earned endurance with felt cost. A touch more friction with external pressure (e.g., an on‑page enforcer) could intensify character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lena’s competence, sensory skill, and quiet ethic are vividly established, and her renunciation (eschewing confrontation, passing evidence to Ruiz) reads consistent and earned. Internal conflict is muted; she rarely wavers, which limits dynamism. Secondary figures apply pressure mostly offstage, keeping the crucible one‑sided. Still, micro‑choices (following the coin’s pull, using silence) reveal priorities under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is crystalline (a covenant to the drowned; “to teach darkness the value of stars”), and her micro‑choices (tilting shutters, angling the mirror) align with that aim. Interiority is expressed through tactile ritual rather than exposition, which suits the silence motif. The cost reads as sustained vigilance and renunciation of ordinary life, but internal contradiction is faint, limiting depth. The remembered boy adds specificity that fuels present action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motive is vivid and consistent—“a gardener of second chances”—and her choices (escalating the window displays, deploying the grotto) align with that drive. Interiority is sensorially particular (tremors, rustles), but internal contradiction is minimal; she moves with near‑frictionless certainty. The lack of visible personal cost or risk on the page limits depth. Still, her micro‑choices reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motives (detach from a constricting self‑lie, answer a deeper call) are clear and embodied through tactile labor vs. luminous summons. Her contradiction—skeptic of magic yet surrendered to whale‑song—feels credible and dramatized. The change is earned via the scrimshaw’s heat and the island’s rise, with a visible relinquishment (the scrimshaw dissolving). Minor softness remains in how little resistance she shows at the pivot from labor to vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile ritual (whittling, burning pamphlets) and the self‑flattened narration, with contradictory impulses (compliance vs. covert grief) enacted rather than stated. Micro‑choices under pressure—sealing the bouquet in a box labeled “Permitted,” submitting to the scan—read as an earned endurance with cost. Emotional void is dramatized without therapy‑speak, and speech/actions align with a survivalist ethic. The character’s moral ambiguity meaningfully constrains tactics at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive: to touch the untouchable and “paraphrase the divine.” Micro-choices (entering barefoot, kneeling “in conversation,” speaking “Unfold,” dancing) reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses surface (“tremor of certainty” evolving to sacred uncertainty), but antagonistic pressure is minimal once the guardians vanish. The cost is conceptual more than felt, keeping the arc persuasive but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (salvaging imperfect beauty) is clear and enacted through tactile, idiosyncratic perception and choices. The status dynamic with Marta shifts credibly from gatekeeper to student. Internal contradiction is light—he rarely wavers—so change arrives more as steady revelation than contested choice. Still, his micro‑choices (reed placement, plant pairings) consistently reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elira’s motive (to discover connection’s texture) is clear and drives concrete moves (placing the lens, striking the fork, singing). Interiority is vivid and particular, but internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance beyond her self‑posed questions. The gentleness credo informs her tactics credibly. The ending costs feel conceptual more than personal, keeping the change modest.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular—she redirects grief into offerings without voyeurism. Contradictory impulses (isolation versus outreach) coexist credibly and guide micro‑choices (engraving, folding, leaving). The endurance choice at the end (unsold locket left without signature or witness) reads as earned stasis with cost. Interiority is vivid and embodied through tools and ritual rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, character‑particular motive and praxis: she maps post‑collapse culture via onyx‑ink cards and a measuring tape. Interiority is steady and credible, if cool; we feel method more than contradiction. The small relational beat (“Tell me what you see”) shows humility-as-agency, but there’s little visible cost or rupture. Strong presence, minimal internal conflict limits ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is vivid and embodied: the lost child and the refusal of sanctioned forgetting drive every micro‑choice (the arrhythmic steps, the off‑key hum). Interiority is particular and sensory (“blood welling where her nails bit her palms”). Contradictory impulses—anguish and joy—coexist credibly at the peak. The final renunciation (grief without ownership by nostalgia) reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motive—to preserve the shape of hope—drives patient, specific actions (the frame-by-frame hunt; embedding the stone) and reveals a steadfast, watchful temperament. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (the river stone’s coolness; the pulse of books), avoiding abstraction. A credible endurance/renunciation lands: she chooses vigilant custodianship over interventionist control, with a felt cost of solitude and ongoing burden. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradiction—self‑respect versus compassion—is embodied in tactile choices (staying to mend vs. leaving to report), not just declared. The tail ritual externalizes her values hierarchy without therapy‑speak. Her final plan (resign, testify, open a real sanctuary) reads as earned renunciation with cost. Minor neatness in her moral calculus trims the edge of messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and specific—she reads scars, coffee rings, and roots with embodied stakes. Contradictory impulses (closure vs. continuation) are dramatized, not told, culminating in a credible renunciation of her prior identity. Micro-choices—refusing to move the hourglass, choosing the root-path, placing her palm on the seed—align with her motives. The cost is conceptual but legible: she surrenders the fantasy of sealing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent: she seeks where unused love is stored and then chooses to release it. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“stitch itself into her ribs like a second skeleton”) with credible contradiction between collector and releaser. Micro‑choices under pressure—initiating the reading, following the echo, deciding to mail the letters—align with her traits. The cost is felt as she carries others’ grief, not just named.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—she bears the ache of others’ stifled art and chooses costly action when the voices crescendo. Interiority is embodied (frozen tears, vibrating ribs) and particular to her cosmology. The internal conflict (yearning for rest vs. compulsion to midwife creativity) is present but could surface as sharper simultaneous contradiction in-scene. The final earned rest reads as credible endurance with cost rather than a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clean and consistent—he’s engineered to be vigilant and chooses the dimmest sphere to “cultivate sparks.” Interiority is spare but character‑specific (dreamless, refusal to smile) and actions align with the stated mission. Internal contradiction is muted; endurance rather than a sharp renunciation carries the arc. The small softening of shoulders reads like earned stasis with a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (“rediscover the uncharted territories within himself”) drives concrete choices: following the wind, testing the gear, stepping into the void. Interiority is vivid and embodied (the hum rattling molars), with a credible tension between fear (unraveling legends) and curiosity. The final renunciation (letting go of the gear; leaving safety) reads earned. Slight limitation: his flaws and blind spots aren’t pressure‑tested by another will on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira and Torvin read as distinct through choices (listening to bark, punching stars, refusing pursuit), with motives consistent and embodied. Internal contradiction is light; this is more ritual than crisis, so tension comes from restraint rather than competing impulses. Still, micro‑choices under pressure (not chasing the fox, choosing forking paths) reveal a principled hierarchy of patience over haste. The final shared vigil feels earned, though the emotional cost remains quiet rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: he removed the bolt to protect the fortress and now risks restoring it, with trembling hands and a vowed silence rooted in nerve trauma. Contradictory impulses operate on the page—service and sabotage, safety and music. The child’s arrival tightens his internal conflict without reducing him to a trope. The final act (reinstalling the bolt and striking C) is credibly earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and sustained, and her tactics (ink pellet, cryptic runes) align with a cool, patient temperament. However, interior contradiction is minimal—she never wavers, so cost registers more as renunciation than struggle. The refusal to rule is credible Earned Stasis, but the emotional price is muted. A moment of genuine doubt or risk would deepen the character’s texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—compulsion to understand “vanished paths”—and her micro‑choices (tapping, code‑digging, diving) align with it. Interiority is embodied through tactile habits and sensory bias rather than labels. The final renunciation—she stops “searching” and starts “revealing”—feels earned and character‑specific. Slight ding: inner contradiction could surface more under peak pressure to add friction to the dive decision.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, embodied motivation (“to discover meaning in the mess”) and concrete inner contradiction (awkwardly confident yet trembling). Micro‑choices under pressure—kneeling, refocusing the glasses downward, seeding the aria—reveal values credibly. The arc toward “remembrance over winning” feels earned through observation and action. The cost is largely conceptual, so the emotional price reads a touch softened.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, compelling motivation and embodied action (“Choose,” she whispered) anchor a steady, competent POV. The grandmother’s choices drive the scene, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers. The renunciation—seeding destiny into many rather than keeping it—registers as a value choice with some cost, though lightly felt. Overall, specific, character‑particular interiority without therapy‑speak elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Embodied interiority is vivid and particular (phantom twinges, barefoot grounding), and choices emerge credibly from trauma and attention. The “freeze” triggers a believable reframe rather than an unearned epiphany. Slight therapy‑speak (“somatic markers,” “calibration”) brushes the edge but is integrated via action. The ending’s renunciation of vigilance (“before assuming the sky will split again”) carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, particular interiority and tactile motives (needle, thread, stitching) drive credible micro‑choices under pressure. The resolve “to descend into necessary darkness” aligns with her actions and the cost (“Pain was the price of coherence”). Slight limitation: she rarely shows contradictory impulses; she “doesn’t flinch,” which trims dynamic tension. Still, her final self‑repricing (crestRISEN) feels earned by prior labor.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clarion motive and embodied interiority (“serene anger,” the reed‑pen work, the self‑trial) lead to a costly, character‑driven choice. Contradictory impulses are muted; she reads as resolute more than conflicted. Micro‑choices (spilling ink by design, applying it to her temples) reveal values without therapy‑speak. The renunciation—choosing disappearance in pursuit of knowledge—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and contradictory—duty vs. conscience—embodied by trembling hands and the “bravely conflicted” stance that resolves into decisive action. Her choice to use the Resonance Table and then accept arrest carries visible cost. The single exchange with Veyra sharpens status dynamics without overexplaining. The endurance afterward (scrubbed name, quarantine) reads as earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s pacifist stance rooted in a violent legacy is vivid and credible, embodied through rituals (the nightly sheathing) and concrete generosity (tea, seeds, cuttings). Interiority is specific—attention to petals’ tremor and roots’ “grief” personalizes her perception. The relationship beats with visitors and the child catalyze micro‑choices that reveal her values. Internal contradiction is present but lightly pressured; no direct test threatens her vow.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fisher’s motive (to catch the goddess’s echo) is clear and her actions track cleanly to it, with deft, embodied micro‑choices (zigzagging to avoid snapping chords, voicing silence). The renunciation at the end (releasing the echo; accepting shards as a tool, not a trophy) reads earned. However, interior contradiction is muted; she stays uniformly competent and cool, so struggle feels low‑friction. The emotional cost is present but understated, limiting depth of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline and character‑specific, with the heiress’s “margins over headlines” ethos driving tactics. Interiority is textured and embodied via the pen nib and tactile engagement with brass and wind. The piece lacks a sharp internal contradiction or visible cost at the end, so the emotional change reads as stance affirmed rather than strained. Still, micro‑choices (modify focus, assemble folio, send to judges) align cleanly with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“to hush the dissonance of old guilt”) drives concrete choices: singing, blood‑ink, tethering the glyph. Interiority is particular and embodied (“voice cracking like thawing ice”). Contradictory impulses—shame, responsibility, competence—coexist and resolve through costly action. Slight safety in how neatly her skill matches the solution keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motive (escape metallic city-noise to “unlearn”) drives tactile choices: kneeling, placing the tile, interjecting via the mandala, and finally not drawing that night. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“lilac unease,” cool mist, vibrating tile) without therapy-speak. The change—reframing silence and her own making—is earned by on‑page choices and a visible cost (the tile’s fracture, relinquishing immediate output). Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but soft; pressure rarely forces a painful trade-off beyond the tile’s sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira’s motive—to redefine mercy through action—reads clear and consistent, with embodied markers like the shard biting her palm. Her agency drives the crucial turns (prying the tessera, refusing to rise, handing it to the magistrate, initiating communal renaming). Internal contradiction is modest; she is resolute more than torn, so the arc leans endurance over ambivalence. The magistrate beat briefly tests her stance and reveals status dynamics without derailing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motivation—an artist refusing to fade who shifts to invitation—drives concrete choices (selecting the cerulean laugh, singing seven notes, tossing the coin). Interiority is conveyed through synesthetic perception that feels character-specific. The internal conflict (clinging to encore vs. letting go) is present but lightly contested on the page, with minimal resistance at the decision beat. Cost is felt via thinning form, though the transition reads smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—somatic cues, fear that the voices are real, and a stubborn tenderness drive her choices. Her agency is active as she maps body signals, patches hardware, and follows the “left hand” tremor. The contradiction (skeptic who longs to believe) plays out on the page. The final renunciation of chemical telepathy for a somatic path feels earned, though the cost remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Her vocation and existential motive are clear and embodied in action, culminating in the shift from observer to participant. Interiority is particular and sensorial, with micro‑choices (calibrating, laying the leaf down, modulating heat) revealing values. The cost—letting the fossil go—reads as an earned renunciation. Slight limitation: conflict remains largely internal and serene, with few contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation and a patient, craft‑based interiority anchor the POV; her micro‑choices (placing the cracked ivory button, spinning the glass slower, leaving jars at crossroads) reveal values. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the cost remains mostly conceptual, muting dramatic bite. The transition from solitary archivist to teacher is credible but underpressured. Emotional embodiment is strong via tactile labor rather than overt feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motives are clear and specific—she isn’t pursuing revenge but a quiet rectification—and her embodied state (burns, careful movement, trembling hands) grounds that drive. “Prudently dared” choices under pressure reveal her value hierarchy. The renunciation—planting rather than retrieving—earns its cost. Internal contradiction is present though subtle (caution vs. exposure), not deeply torn.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Richly particular interiority and embodied craft; his choice to slow by stillness and the final offering of the needle read motivated and specific. Internal contradiction is subtle—competence and tenderness face grief’s weight—but never truly pressures him toward fracture. The relationship with the passenger gains charge at the end yet remains oblique. A credible Earned Stasis/renunciation arc lands without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks why this oasis resists change—and her micro‑choices (aligning the glass, watering the bee, not firing, leaving the glass behind) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied and particular to a potter’s sensibility. Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, so pressure is more contemplative than conflicted. The renunciation (leaving the compass‑glass) reads as a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: she shifts from cultivation to calibration, measuring “how much pressure a barrier could bear” and acting on it. The backstory of the brother/fire gives credible cost and frames a guarded heart that gently reopens. Micro‑choices (corner selection, angling prisms, using the tooth) reveal values without sermonizing. The contradiction—wistfully pragmatic yet offering beauty—holds on the page and earns the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veyra’s motives (resist entropy, safeguard and then repurpose memory) are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure (sprinting to Chamber Seven, channeling resonance, then choosing genesis) reveal values. Interiority is particular (botanist past, mammoth migrations) and embodied through her reflective skin. Internal conflict is present but subtle—burden vs. sovereignty—skewing more toward assuredness than contradiction. The cost is felt but not stark, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s longing (“the thread that connects all things”) motivates concrete choices—accepting the twig spiral’s summons, writing names, stepping into the pool. Interiority is specific (ink-stained hands, carried names like stones) and ties to action. The renunciation of selfhood registers as cost, though resistance is minimal and the choice comes smoothly. A touch more friction in the moment of “Rejoin” would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s professional specificity and calm, methodical agency are vivid and consistent, with concrete embodiment (molars rattling, cold coffee, oscilloscope). Motivation is clear and sustained, and actions align with character. Internal contradiction is light—competence rarely strains, and we don’t see a meaningful slip or cost beyond fatigue. The ending’s stance (vigilant, hopeful defiance) feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s prudently adventurous claustrophobia yields concrete micro‑choices (hesitation, chanting coordinates, stepping into the tight passage). Her embodied fear is credible, but the final transformation to fearless space‑weaver feels rapid and nearly costless. The compass pointing to her chest neatly externalizes the internal turn. Emotional contradiction under pressure is present, if resolved a touch tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motives (awakening empathy over courtroom justice) are clear and drive concrete choices: staging the quarry vigil, lighting candles, placing the ribbon, and touching the man’s hand. Her face blindness inflects perception and action in specific ways (texture‑based sketches, tactile anchors). The killer’s guilt is embodied (tremor, coat salt, boots avoiding the ribbon), enabling an honest, non‑carceral resolution. Internal contradiction is subtle (compassion vs. danger/justice) but credible for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular—prove her theory, honor her ancestor, end exile—and her “nervously confident” stance reads in action (she doesn’t flinch as alarms blare). The copper nail and embodied reactions give her interiority texture. However, she encounters little friction or mistake on the page, so contradiction under pressure remains under-explored. The final reorientation feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority anchors the fiddler’s motive (turning “never” into possibility) and informs embodied choices: playing again, refusing to turn, and finally leaving. Contradictory impulses—longing to pursue vs. disciplined refusal—surface cleanly in the mirror silhouette moment. The change (acceptance/allowance) reads earned if quiet, with felt cost in not chasing. Slightly low pressure and minimal on‑page friction keep it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and specific, with coherent motives rooted in lineage and the need to reframe failure. Contradictory impulses (run vs. reroute; disruption vs. sanctuary) are dramatized through choices like laying territorial markers and refusing to restart the company. The eventual renunciation (no reopening) reads earned with a felt cost. Occasional aphoristic lines skim generality but do not undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear (translation toward redemption) and her micro-choices are decisive: aligning Zeta Cygni with glyphs, choosing lucidity, singing to redistribute burdens, and reframing her role. Interiority is particular and embodied (ink-stained fingers; scent of pressed daylily). The piece lacks a strong contradictory impulse—she rarely hesitates—which slightly softens the arc. Still, the final renunciation of “hoarding” for redistribution reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority: she fears the seed’s revelations yet chooses to kneel and press her palm, allowing rooting with cost. Contradictory impulses (guardian vs. revealer) operate in scene, not summary. The final unguarding reads earned by the expanding‑circle ordeal. Minor note: her competence makes the path feel assured, slightly softening struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—she seeks the center to reawaken the eclipsed covenant—and her micro‑choices (heeding the pull, pressing the clipping) align. Interiority is vivid and embodied via roots in her soles and glowing scars. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she reads almost purely resolute, limiting dramatic torque. The final endurance/merger carries cost conceptually but not acutely on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s “fiercely gentle” ethos drives every micro‑choice, from barefoot ritual to refusing force, and Kael’s rigid counter‑stance applies clean pressure. Their status dynamic flips subtly when the orchard restrains him and she anchors him by touch. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual rather than labels. The closing “seedling” loosening reads as a credible, earned relational shift with cost implied in Kael’s softening.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Jasper’s interiority is specific and embodied—catalog numbers as ritual, the loupe he chooses not to reach for—showing a credible contradiction between control and longing. His shift from “insulating with facts” to “listening” is earned by on‑page micro‑choices (holding the cloth to his ear, typing the project). The faint dialogue with Ruiz adds pressure and status without hijacking the lens. Cost is felt as vulnerability and the renunciation of his protective method.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motivation (to understand transitions) is precise and enacted through patient, non‑grasping choices; her buried dissertations add credible contradiction (seeker vs. fear of nearing truth). Micro‑choices (waiting, inventing a sign for “forgiveness,” refusing to translate the final symbol) reveal a hierarchy of values. Embodied perceptions (soil-memory, pulse syncing to the arbor) keep emotions grounded. The renunciation at the end feels earned with a subtle but felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Specific, embodied interiority (lunar‑calibrated spectacles, oilskin, geared body) and a clear motive (“preserve wonder in routine”) ground her choices. The internal contradiction (truth vs. beautiful lies; waxing/waning self) is present but lightly tested, with competence smoothing most friction. Micro‑choices (lifting, immersing, shelving under “Waning Wonder”) reveal values. The cost reads as softening/blurred edges rather than a difficult trade, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is crystal clear from the opening and coheres through action; the choice to confess and then crown herself under pressure is earned. Contradictory impulses register credibly (protective lie to sister vs. envy of the dead; longing for connection vs. wish to be forgotten). Embodied detail grounds emotion (“gloved fingers,” “boots crunching,” body synced to the cave’s breath). The transformation into a conduit reads as a costly renunciation of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline (self-forgiveness via mapping), embodied through concrete micro-choices (timing echoes, marking “Point Zero,” peeling ivy). Contradictory impulses register: she quits medication for clarity that hurts, seeking both penance and repair. Emotional texture is lived-in rather than labeled, with the sister-flood wound driving her method. The final renunciation (threshold over terminus) feels earned with visible cost in weeping, sleepless floor, and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she seeks the archive and pays with her identity. Interiority is embodied via the watch’s heat and the bone stylus etching into skin. Contradictory impulses—cautious exuberance vs. risk—surface through micro‑choices (reaching into negative space, stepping through the arch). Slight distance from concrete, scene‑bound struggle keeps this just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motive—refusing extractive provenance in favor of restorative memory—is clear and consistent, with credible interior texture (coffee reading, plant-telepathy aversion, “cost her more than it had given”). The crucial choice to sound the violin as a conduit rather than authenticate it reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (duty vs dream), with limited on‑page struggle once the choice is made. The Chancellor’s presence adds pressure but not a deep relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation and vocation drive every choice, with tactile ritual detail (oils, powders, “patterns in static”). Internal contradiction is minimal—she feels reverence more than struggle—so the arc reads as steady competence rather than pressured change. Micro‑choices (oil strokes, chip placement, surrendering to patterns) reveal values but not much cost beyond solemn acceptance. The closing renunciation (letting the chip drift; planning her own) feels earned, if emotionally even.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and coherent—seeking contentment after forgiveness—and her micro‑choices (climbing, entering the grotto, handling and finally wearing the hairpin) align with that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied (“Her fingers trembled—not from sorrow, but from the weight of release”). The on‑page contradiction is quieter (steadfast caretaker vs. personal hurt) but present and credibly resolved. Slight abstraction in places (“source of contentment”) softens the felt friction before the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and specific—bare feet on cold stone, the cloak’s weight, the sting at the clasp—while her contradiction (paid certainty vs. felt doubt) is dramatized, not summarized. The unhooking choice is earned by the chimes, the shard, and the campfire deadline. Stakes and cost (clients lost, exposure) register. A slight tilt toward label phrases (“protected vulnerability”) is the only softness.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motives (to teach vanishing via withholding) are clear and embodied by concrete actions (throwing the stone, refusing to explain). Her backward-aging grief adds texture without melodrama. Kael’s shift from frustration to insight is credible, though his inner conflict remains light. The final vow reads as an earned stance, but the visible cost is deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single‑POV interiority feels specific and embodied (“tuning its inner resonance to the rhythm of the flock’s flight”). Motivation is coherent—listening over motion—and the Earned Stasis at the end is credible (“It would not journey today. Nor tomorrow.”). The character’s contradiction (keeper vs. chaser) resolves into principled endurance with visible cost. Slight archetypal tilt limits deeper messy ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s motive (refusing sterile automation in favor of hand-made wonder) is clear, embodied, and drives each choice. The hesitation before mist-walking and the relinquishing of the keystone show credible internal conflict with visible cost. Interiority is particular (“tastes like laughter or grief”), not stock. A slight tilt toward telling in the sky-cult exposition keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, idiosyncratic motive (hunting the color of sound) drives concrete choices: refusing to chase the woman, diving, and leaving the ledger for the next seeker. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“boots clicked hollowly,” “water swallowing his breath like a vow”). Contradictory impulses (revelation vs. madness) are evoked but rarely pressure him into visibly costly trade‑offs in the moment. The closing renunciation (from searching to signifying) reads earned if a touch comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motive (surrendering control to lots to “wavelength align with purpose”) evolves into agency without breaking her contradictions. Embodied interiority (molars, throat, bone, heat) grounds the lyric register. The renunciation of lots is earned by her practiced method and the triggered vision; cost = taking responsibility for the survivors. A hair soft on visible external consequence, but psychologically credible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: he seeks to transmute grief by naming and crystallizing fears. Interiority is concrete (cloak whispering like regret, echoes clinging to ribs) and choices align with pressure. The refusal to stop “her” haunts the ritual, giving the final renunciation/acceptance weight. Slight neatness in the stated purpose softens ambiguity but doesn’t undercut the earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clean and embodied—he’s not after glory but balance—and his micro‑choices (aligning the halves, refusing to ring, then releasing the bell) align with that stance. The contradiction between “lukewarm” temperament and brittle devotion reads specific rather than generic. Internal conflict is understated; he meets little resistance, so the felt cost leans on the sacrifice of the bell and months of effort. Still, the interiority is particular and credible under quiet pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory mandate (contain sentiment vs. humane practice) drives credible micro‑choices—collecting, narrating, then publicly arranging relics. His interior turn at the gazebo is motivated by accumulated specifics (label, distiller’s photo). Embodied detail (mud, trembling label) grounds emotion. The cost is present but soft—the officials’ leniency blunts peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority (pressed petals, the blotted tear) grounds a credible contradiction—rigor versus wonder—resolved by a choice to surrender control. Micro‑choices under pressure (lighting breath‑flame, attending to the starlings, letting the crystal be “awakened” rather than melted) align with her motive and reveal character. The cost is quiet but legible: relinquishing control and the crystal itself to become a vessel. Slightly idealized competence smooths struggle, keeping it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is crystalline—preserving communal trust—and embodied through tactile rituals with the buckle. The prior mistake (premature storm warning) credibly informs present caution and choice. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal; she seldom wavers on the page, so the struggle reads as burdened competence rather than live conflict. Still, micro‑choices (how and when to signal) reveal values with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motive—to end numbness without re‑enslaving identity—is clear and his silence-as-stance under accusation reveals a coherent, contradictory self. The micro-choices (refusing to argue, choosing resonance over will) align with the final renunciation of claim. Emotional embodiment is often stylized but lands in the closing warmth returning to his chest. Minor abstraction keeps us a step distant from visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motive—guarding space for unruly innovation—is clear and coherently enacted through planting the seed, designing rooms, and choosing patience over forcing outcomes. Interiority is largely conveyed by action and curated description rather than conflict-on-the-page; we don’t feel contradictory impulses grinding in-scene. The Earned Stasis at the end (accepting a life without bloom) reads motivated and costly. Greater dramatization of a pressured micro‑choice would deepen the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vivid, embodied interiority grounds his ritual in concrete acts (dragging the gutted blower, clutching the pull cord, humming until the tunnel “answers”). Motivation is precise and persistent—keep darkness from “solidifying” by coaxing fragments of laughter. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope; endurance vs. futility) coexist on the page. The Earned Stasis at the end feels motivated and costly rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear—loneliness and dimensional homesickness drive the guardian from hoarding and “interiorizing exteriors” to relinquishing the pendant. Contradictory impulses (clutching certainty vs. befriending uncertainty) operate simultaneously and resolve in a credible, felt renunciation. The embodied details (licking frozen cheeks; frost‑shivering fur) ground the emotions. The choice to give away the pendant carries a visible cost and earns the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he steals the crozier “not for sacrilege, but salvation,” driving concrete micro‑choices (blood as signature, iterative corrections). The contradiction “stoically sensitive” manifests in action (no gasp, an exhale) and stance under pressure. Change reads earned: he renounces mastery/hope for ongoing becoming, a costly acceptance. Slight softness: external pressure is minimal, so cost remains primarily conceptual rather than dramatized through opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is specific and sustained (seeking a “shard of hush” and “the beginning in every ending”), and her choices—tuning, discarding assumptions, conducting—align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile tech (copper‑threaded gloves, teeth tingling) and a credible professional mindset. The internal contradiction (chasing loud answers vs. listening for silence) is present but subtle, yielding a quieter tension than a true crucible. The renunciation of glory for function lands, though cost remains conceptual rather than acutely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation (stitching timelines for the passengers) drives every action, and professional detail grounds him. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he rarely wavers—so pressure doesn’t expose layered conflict. The “resiliently positive” trait reads persuasively through behavior rather than label. The closing Earned Stasis—choosing stewardship over celebration—feels earned but light on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crisp and character‑particular: she isn’t escaping but mapping connection, and her choices (persisting despite warnings; finally letting the thread go) align. The interior contradiction—rigor vs. fear—shows when she ignores the mirrored selves’ cautions. Embodied perception (“warm as a sleeping vein,” “bare feet”) grounds emotion without therapy‑speak. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the final self‑reappraisal (“older, quieter”) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s motivation and competence are clear and particular, and small, character-driven choices (balcony contemplation; bringing and recontextualizing the chain link) reveal her values. Interiority is steady and grounded in vocation rather than generic feeling. However, internal conflict is minimal and largely untested on the page, keeping change at the level of reaffirmation rather than a pressured turn. The students’ presence adds texture, not crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tracer’s motive—prevent unanswered echoes from festering—consistently drives her micro‑choices, from kneeling in the damp to telling a hard truth. Embodied interiority shows in sensory‑tuned method (pressing the hearing aid to her temple, reading rhythm as ache). The relationship with the girl evolves credibly through resonance rather than neat talk therapy. The cost is quiet but present: she risks wounding to end waiting by saying “They’re not coming back.”

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, particular motivation (“to stand by the unremembered”) drives concrete choices under pressure (continuing despite claustrophobia; waiting as water returns). Interiority is embodied and specific (dust, salt, breath; the fleck’s warmth) rather than labeled. The refusal to flee immediately at the tide is an earned endurance choice with felt cost. Slightly limited internal contradiction beyond fear vs mission keeps it short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motives are coherent and particular—retrieval of “wisdom from failure,” not rescue—and his choices (initiating the ink ritual, pressing the shard into his palm) reveal a lived contradiction between fragility and endurance. Embodied texture (bare feet on marble, breath fogging glass) deepens interiority. The cost is quiet rather than dramatic, but the earned stasis—accepting settlement over salvation—reads credible. Slight limitation: his reluctance and the practical stakes against him rarely force a sharper trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is precise and sustained: revive a dead mother tongue via risky means. Interiority is embodied (texture of grief/joy) and filtered through her occupational method. Contradictory impulses (feeding the diamond’s hunger vs. preserving “pure signal”) surface but aren’t deeply contested. Final endurance choice (quiet articulation over spectacle) feels earned with a soft, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and arc are coherent and embodied: she chooses to reveal the arrowhead and to press SEND, sacrificing her bitterness and the phone. Interiority is concrete (the scar, the “throat tight,” the marrow‑nesting presence) and action-aligned. Internal contradiction is present but light; she’s already predisposed to release, so struggle feels brief. Moira provides gentle but real counterpressure, not antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Her motive is clear and sustained, with embodied cost (aching bow arm, blisters) and specific tactics. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she acts from steady conviction without a palpable counter‑impulse. The statues’ shift to curiosity reduces interpersonal crucible pressure. Still, micro‑choices (soft timbre, pressing the shell to the body, pacing escalation) reveal values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive (linking absences; smuggling hope) drives precise micro-choices: rerouting through vents, using Marla’s grid, launching despite risk. The “respectfully rebellious” stance is dramatized (bowing to guards, omitting truth) rather than labeled. Internal conflict is subtle but present—principled law‑bending versus deference. The cost lands as emotional weight more than a stark renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    His motive—to interpret silence as possibility—drives clear, aligned actions, and his occupational specificity grounds him. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he meets no resisting force beyond endurance. Micro‑choices (placing the halo, choosing to “sing” through craft) reveal values credibly. The closing renunciation (he will never speak) feels earned but low‑cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particularized motivation and perceptual bias (“sanely eccentric,” alphabetizing by resonance) produce coherent choices—she steals into the Restricted Stacks, activates the tessellation, sings. Interiority is present via tactile and auditory cues (chalk dust, humming), but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers. Her relationship to the grandmother via the scarf adds depth without becoming sentimentality. The final stance (reawakener, not cataloger) reads earned, though the on‑page cost remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The librarian’s motive is singular and consistent, and her micro-choices (angling the palette, selecting wavelengths, deciding the three-part blend) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and character-particular via tool-use and sensory focus rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses surface subtly (obsession versus surrender) but could sharpen under peak pressure. The closing exchange earns a quiet renunciation/savoring without false tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and steady—he aims to free an idea—and his choices (using the hair, tying the crimson ribbon) align with that purpose. Interiority is textured but largely unwavering; he seldom falters, so contradictory impulses are muted. The crimson ribbon vow is the closest thing to an internal cost, but his near‑invincible competence limits felt struggle. The final stance reads earned, if emotionally cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is vivid and character‑specific: recovery of stolen memories drives rigorous, embodied inquiry. The internal conflict culminates in a credible Earned Stasis—leave and warn vs. stay and pay with the rest of herself. Interiority is sensorial and non‑generic (rosewater, pipe smoke, peaches). The final smile reads as a costly acceptance powered by her flaw—curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, particular interiority with embodied contradictions: she’s both brusque and protective, choosing sharp pedagogy over comfort. Micro-choices under pressure (backward pacing, one forward step, the 37-degree line) reveal values at cost. The novice and cartographer dynamics sharpen her motive without softening her edges. The Earned Stasis—maintaining combative mentorship despite exile risk—reads credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motive—to preserve the color of wonder—reads clear and particular, and her embodied choices (setting aside tools, weaving memory into filaments, accepting stewardship) align with that drive. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine internal friction under pressure, so the arc lacks a felt trade‑off beyond devotion. The final stance (“not a savior, but a steward”) is resonant but not wrestled for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motive (balance, not penance) drives concrete micro-choices, with a credible hesitation at the “blackened” knot. Competence is offset by earned risk—“Some knots had teeth”—so success isn’t frictionless. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (needle, hemp, salt) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light but present: tenderness versus necessary transgression in piercing the guilt-knot.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive (“interpret silence with empathy”) drive concrete choices (overlaying footage, waiting through dusk, leaving yarrow). The quiet renunciation—choosing to witness rather than rebuild—reads earned. Internal tension (proof vs. reverence) is present but subtle rather than contested on the page. Still, her methods and micro‑choices reveal a distinct, embodied psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s “quietly analytic” drive coheres from salvage to lab obsession to the relinquishment on the cliff, with a credible tug-of-war between solving and surrendering. Embodied beats (cold seeping into wrists, hollow-and-humming after) anchor the abstract. The cost—giving up the globe and the compulsion to master grief—reads on the page. A hair of tidy articulation remains in lines that define the insight outright.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular interiority (loneliness seeking resonance) drives concrete micro-choices: climbing for sanctuary, encoding, then risking voice. Contradictory impulses are present but soft—privacy versus invitation—so the crucible isn’t sharply conflicted. Embodied emotion lands (“bolt plate…grew warm,” tears at the ghost’s reply). The closing choice to “build a bridge” credibly costs her solitude-as-shield without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cohesive single-POV interiority with tactile choices (tracing the cipher, kneeling, breaking the seal) that reveal values. Motivation is clear and character-particular, anchored in the mentor bond and the “joy beneath anguish” quest. Internal conflict is present but gentle; contradictions never truly snag her, which softens cost. The closing renunciation of treasure for “truth” reads earned but low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular interiority rooted in vocation and grief; her ledger entries and cloud-emotion taxonomy reveal a distinctive psyche. The contradiction “quietly explosive” is dramatized through restraint and charged attention rather than summary. Her final acceptance—memorializing “Altocumulus #112: release”—reads as an earned endurance choice with cost. Minor note: some labeled insights verge on explicative (“That emptiness is not void, but vessel”), but they’re grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline from the first line and drives every action: finish the sky before demolition. Interiority is specific to her tactile cognition; the coin and textures reveal character. The revelation that her “deficit” is a lens is earned by the tactile process on the page. Minor ding: little contradictory impulse beyond the mid‑story reframing, so pressure reads more devotional than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Arlen’s diligently curious drive is specific, embodied, and consistent, and his micro‑choices (kneeling to trace chalk, testing phrases, directing hops) reveal character. Internal contradiction is minimal—he encounters little pushback or fear—so pressure doesn’t expose deeper fault lines. The brief dynamic with Veyra adds status texture but resolves quickly. The closing dog‑ear choice signals growth, though its cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and specific—she seeks the “rhythm of repair” to understand which breaks must remain—expressed through concrete micro-choices (laying keys, tracing rather than seizing). Interiority is textured via embodied memory-images in the mirrors. The renunciation at the end (apron’s light surrendered, leaving empty‑handed) reads as an earned stance shift with cost. A touch more friction or contradictory impulse under peak pressure would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elira’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her catalytic choices drive events. However, interiority is thin and largely unconflicted; she reads near‑saintly with little contradictory impulse under pressure. Secondary characters sketch stakes but don’t apply counter‑pressure. The final shift (from isolation to communal departure) is earned, though the cost is felt more collectively than personally.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied in precise, tactile choices (placing the puppet head, turning the spindle, whispering the lullaby). Interior conflict is minimal; he operates with serene conviction rather than contradictory impulses. Still, his scarred body and “tuning forks” ribs give credible cost and specificity. The closing renunciation—honoring rather than saving—feels earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, consistent motive (prevent the chorus from growing) paired with a resigned temperament yields a credible, specific interiority. His “arithmetic” altruism and offhand precision create a lived tension between reluctance and care. Micro‑choices under pressure—heel‑drags, pebble clusters, coded whistles—embody character. The cost is an earned stasis: he relinquishes recognition or relief and returns to the orchard’s heart.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich, embodied interiority anchors motive and action (gloves off, foam in hand, placing the chrysalis). The guilt/atonement tension feels credible, and the decision to redesign toward “graceful dissolution” is earned. A few lines verge on tidy diagnosis (“Her daughter’s death hadn’t been a flaw...”), slightly smoothing contradiction. Still, micro‑choices consistently reveal a hierarchy of values with on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motive (to “unwrite herself”) and embodied ritual actions (arranging, pouring, incising, ledgering) reveal character under gentle pressure. The necessity vs. altruism tension is credible but never forces a hard micro‑choice. Interiority is textured without therapy‑speak. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s motive is clear and embodied: she chooses to remove her gloves and endure psychic contagion to “sandpaper” rough memories. Her micro-choices under pressure (pillar to arch to basin) align with this drive and reveal competence plus cost. Internal contradiction is subtler—she trembles but rarely wavers—so the conflict leans toward steadfast endurance over ambivalence. The ending registers earned change without feeling unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices (climbing, rigging the weight, singing) directly pursue her goal. Interiority is present through tactile talisman logic and choral craft, but there’s little true contradiction or visible struggle. She meets minimal resistance; her empathy never costs her beyond leaving the weight behind. The final stance feels earned, if gently so.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single‑POV interiority is vivid and character‑particular: the engineer’s “chaotically precise” mind filters canyon features as synaptic terrain. Motivation is coherent (not to mourn but to modify), and key micro‑choices—touching the mirror, accepting entangled memory, deciding to return—align with that drive. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. curiosity/control) are present but softly dramatized. The cost is mostly internal and implied, landing just shy of sharper on‑page abrasion.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s goal and method are clear and consistent, with embodied perception (“each synaptic thread glowing”) revealing a mind built for pattern. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely doubts or wavers—so pressure doesn’t expose layered impulses. Micro‑choices (which dialect to whisper, whether to seize Fragment Delta) are present but low‑friction. The closing acceptance of stewardship reads credible but not costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s motive is lucid and embodied—he “carves with listening” and persists through a hollowed world—but internal contradiction is light, with little on‑page resistance or cost beyond endurance. His micro‑choices (collecting, mapping cracks, aligning grain) reveal a singular sensibility. The emotional pivot—tears of recognition as the grove sculpts him—is earned but not contested. Strong, intimate portraiture without deep friction.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct interiority and embodied detail (the dented stone, pupils’ tears) root his motive and flaw. His micro-choices—staying to “correlate,” then rising to carry the covenant forward—track cleanly. Internal conflict is present but gentle; contradictory impulses rarely collide under pressure. The change is credible yet the felt cost is more inferred than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is precise and embodied in action; her nonviolent ethos directly shapes her tactics. The village-grief memory grounds her vocation without derailing momentum. Internal contradiction is minimal—she’s unwavering—which trims depth but preserves coherence. Micro-choices (frequency shifts, breath control) reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elira’s motive—cultivating serenity within motion—is distinct and consistently embodied through olfactory perception and ritualized journaling. Her agency (predicting dusk bloom, choosing to inhale, replanting the husk) reveals character under pressure. However, internal contradiction is light; she faces little genuine temptation or risk beyond endurance of the stench. The change reads as deepening of an already-set stance rather than a hard-earned pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s drive is clear (find the source of resilience) and she makes concrete, escalating choices: investigate the glint, take the arrow, commit it to the Grandmother tree. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, with competence grounded in her vocation. The emotional turn from fixing to listening lands, though internal contradiction is light and conflict mostly externalized to time/physics. The cost is modest but present in the renunciation of a fixer’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The investigator’s motive and competence are vivid and consistent, and his micro-choices (measuring, mapping, stepping into the gust’s path) align with his ethos. The patch and Varga’s transmission charge his purpose with quiet grief. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely hesitates or pays a visible emotional price beyond resolve. The final stance feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she comes to “certify wonder” and acts through striking, surrendering, and finally renouncing the sheet. Interiority is embodied via synesthesia and concrete sensory crossovers (G‑minor as burnt caramel). The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses or a felt moral bind, so struggle reads gentle. Cost is modest but present (exertion, surrender, braving the blizzard).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline (“to harvest insights from failure”) and every micro‑choice aligns, from calibrating driftwood to breathing for echo, not song. The interiority is particular—precision over fear, patience over glory—though internal contradiction is mostly implicit rather than dramatized in clash. The renunciation (leaving the flute) reads as an earned stasis with felt cost. A touch more on‑page friction between urge to restore and ethic to witness could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation (hunger to map emotion) is vivid and consistent, and specific choices (pressing the halo to her temple, testing the clockmaker, the final unsigned glyph) reveal character under pressure. The erosion from “losing her own name” adds a credible cost and contradiction to her empathy method. However, most turns are summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, so micro‑choices under immediate pressure are limited. The lack of an on‑page relational crucible keeps some complexity theoretical rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and a credible tug between duty (the dawn delivery) and her compulsion to cultivate wonder. Micro‑choices—taking the Hollow Market fork, revealing the pendant, and ultimately releasing it—track cleanly to her value hierarchy. Embodied emotion (boots singing frost; pendant thrumming her sternum) avoids generic labels. Minor hedge: the mentor’s aphorism edges toward tidy wisdom but is earned by the spiderweb memory.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—she seeks proof and enacts it through measured observation and restraint. The renunciation (“She would not publish. She would not preach.”) lands as earned stasis with a felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“borrowed coat” of fear). A deeper on‑page contradiction under pressure could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystalline—reach the lost lover—and the self‑sacrifice is credibly earned by her history and present isolation. Interiority is embodied (sap bead’s heat, plum scent, tactile loom work) rather than labeled. The internal conflict (keep self vs. send message) is dramatized in the choice to weave herself. Slight safety: we rarely see a counter‑impulse tempt her away at the brink.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlo’s motivation—“to coax resilience from rubble”—is clear and embodied through repeated, humble choices rather than declarations. His renunciation of the last silk threads earns the ending’s stance. Internal contradiction is subtle (meekness vs. transformative ambition) but rarely placed under acute on‑page pressure. The child scene adds relational texture without diluting his singular drive.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and particular, and her sensory-driven method reveals character through action. The grief and curiosity around her mother and the shard feel embodied rather than labeled. Internal conflict is present but underdramatized—access to the core and revelation come with little on‑page resistance that would expose more contradictions. The final acceptance of responsibility reads earned, if emotionally weighted more than behaviorally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied: the sea glass as “bottled feeling of safety” and the stone‑code ritual reveal motive through tactile choices. Contradictory impulses—reticence vs. a disciplined urge to connect/protect—coexist without tidy resolution. Peak micro‑choices (placing the glass, building the cairn, not turning back when the light relumes) feel character‑true. The endurance at the end reads as earned stasis with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vivid, coherent interiority with a distinctive ethos (“neither malice nor mercy”) and concrete ritual choices (raising the wick, whispering paradoxes). The accidental-prophet flaw adds texture and implied cost, but pressure rarely forces a conflicted trade-off on the page. Emotional embodiment is mostly lyrical rather than felt through struggle, leaving contradiction underused. The endurance at the end reads credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, particular interiority and a sustained motive (to understand story‑magnetism) drive concrete actions (sun‑tracking, patient observation, the final dye attempt). The donor heart and theft establish credible fractures without melodrama. The change—renouncing imitation to cultivate her own apertures—reads earned though the on‑page cost is largely conceptual. Limited direct pressure keeps contradictory impulses mostly inferred rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear, particular, and sustained: an arboreal curiosity reframes her “repair” into listening and mapping. Embodied choices—patient deconstruction, refusal to force, the final “Show me”—reveal character. Internal contradiction is light; little friction challenges her competence or belief. The final renunciation of “fixing” for remembering lands but at a modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, embodied motivation (rekindle a realm) and a consistent inner texture (scattered memory curated through sensory shards). Key micro-choices—choosing to hum, to invite silence, to not force—reveal values under pressure. The identity shift from “keeper of fragments” to “the loom” feels earned if a touch swift. Internal contradiction (fractured memory vs. steady stewardship) is present but could face sharper on‑page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is specific and textured: the crumpled invitation, her tactile care with books, and the whispered self‑naming show contradictory impulses (hiding vs. presence) acting on the page. Her empathy is not a label; it informs her micro‑choices and past wounds (“unorthodox empathy”). The final stance—“She did not leave. She did not stay as she had.”—reads as an earned renunciation with a felt cost (ending the refuge of invisibility). Minor softness remains around external pressure, but motivation and embodiment are convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, embodied interiority and motive (“permission from the earth itself to feel sacred again”) drive concrete micro‑choices: offering bread, delaying entry, lighting a candle, uncloaking, planting seeds. The contradiction—armored caution vs. vulnerable attention—shows on the page and resolves into a credibly earned stance. Cost is subtle but present in the risk of hope and exposure. Slight softness remains around how much pressure her choice to wait truly exacts.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira’s motive—preserving meaning against oblivion—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (calibration, transcription, sealing). Interiority is particular and embodied (frosted lenses, breath fog) with a credible, restrained awe. The internal conflict is relatively soft (meticulous care vs. fading time), limiting depth of contradiction. Still, the final endurance/renunciation—spending the slide’s magic to translate it—reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“thwart the deal…capture the sound of trust breaking”) drives specific micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is textured (fear calcified into purpose) and embodied through tactics rather than summary. Relationship pressure with Marla/The Chain is indirect but legible through status cues. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; a slightly sharper on‑page cost to her choice would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear interiority and embodied micro‑choices (kneel, taste, ten paces, hand to the threshold, pocketing the ring) reveal a skeptic whose doubt credibly reconfigures into trust. The man’s “personal storm as archive” motive is concise and affecting, adding ethical pressure. The shift from analysis to surrender reads earned rather than tidy epiphany. Minor ding: her change is fast, but the sensory method binds it to on‑page experience.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, embodied motivation (rectify/uncork) with credible history; the sizzle of tears and the bone‑fit of the charcoal anchor emotion. Contradictions—hoarder of memories vs. liberator—surface in action, not only declaration. The father dynamic lands through the lock and the final tear drawn on his portrait. A hair tidy in places (“creativity isn’t a faucet…”) slightly flattens interior ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystal clear and embodied (she wilts near dishonesty yet keeps moving), and choices under pressure reveal values (following the map, reading letters aloud). Interiority is concrete and character‑specific through tools and craft. Internal contradiction is present but mild—more endurance than torn impulse. The closing renunciation/acceptance (“become the archive”) feels earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive (preserving wonder) expressed through embodied practice and seasonal muteness; micro‑choices—tuning in storms, placing the child’s hand—reveal values. Internal contradiction is subtler (preservation vs non‑evangelism) but present. The end’s renunciation (she stops climbing) is motivated but occurs off‑stage, softening felt cost. Still, the character reads distinct and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and character‑specific: resolve inner static before it overloads the core. The decision to open the box and run a “controlled burn” is an earned act under pressure. Interiority is embodied via bioglass roses and the hum of fears; contradictions (caretaker vs. arsonist of its own dread) are present. The cost is mostly transformational rather than painful, slightly softening the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s choices are clear, consistent, and quietly forceful (refusing to open the mailbox, choosing to “hear” and hum until Leo answers). Interiority is restrained but specific through action rather than abstract labels. Leo’s turn feels credible and earned. Limited internal contradiction keeps this shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motive and method are precise and character‑particular, with tactile choices (dance protocols, dice glyphs) revealing a disciplined, subversive temperament. However, interior contradiction is muted; her competence goes largely untested on the page, minimizing visible struggle. The refusal to board the sub reads as a principled renunciation with cost, but the emotional friction around that choice is underplayed. Strong embodiment and micro‑choices, light on ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s motive—finding where deleted memories go, and her father—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile ritual and observation. Her micro‑choices (adding the aster, stepping through) align with her trained attention and grief‑driven curiosity. Internal contradiction is subtle (a steadied professional method versus tremor under cosmic pressure) but present; a sharper felt cost at the threshold would raise stakes. The reunion beat feels earned by the prior patterning of flowers and grounds.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation and method are clear and consistent; she chooses listening over force and takes concrete actions (placing the wing, “cradling” the plea). Interiority is textured through sensory attunement rather than labels. However, conflict within her is minimal—she meets pressure with near-perfect serenity—so the change reads as affirmation more than struggle. The cost is mostly ongoing commitment, felt but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tutor’s desire—to answer a building that’s been whispering—feels specific and consistent, and her ritualized teas credibly channel that want. The neighbor dynamic carries lived subtext, with “agreed upon lies” functioning as relationship pressure. Internal contradiction is quieter (companion vs. investigator) but present. The final acceptance of key and truth reads earned, though the felt cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (archive before dawn) and embodied interiority (dread vs steady breath; skeptic vs charmed) drive credible micro‑choices. The sequence—kneeling, shell to temple, vow, leaving the shell—tracks a consistent value hierarchy. A touch of abstract self‑diagnosis (“translating isolation into independence”) edges toward thesis, but it’s grounded by action. The earned refusal to be “healed” reads as an Earned Stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular—her forger’s craft harnessed to absolution—not merely declared. Interiority is embodied through craft choices (tears‑ink, thorn prick), though contradictory impulses are limited; she reads mostly unwavering. Micro‑choices under pressure (softening imperatives, finishing the final stroke as the last drop falls) reveal values cleanly. A felt cost lands (anonymity, relinquished tools), but the inner conflict could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, character‑particular motivation (“to learn why some people echo”) and embodied stakes (trembling not from fear but from weight) drive credible choices. The compassionate pivot—to sing rather than destroy—flows from earlier training in silence and surrender, not a last‑second turn. Some inner contradiction is present (calling it theft while choosing mercy), but opposition never strains her limits beyond a raw throat. A touch more friction or risk to her plan would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline and character-specific, and her micro-choices (entering the shrine, reading the dream-constellations, placing the globe) align with it. Interiority is vivid without therapy-speak, but internal contradiction is minimal—she moves with serene competence and little friction. The cost is present but quiet: releasing the child’s echoes means relinquishing her own access to them. A touch more struggle or ambiguity under pressure would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single‑POV interiority is textured and particular; the net‑mender’s values show through tactile choices (whistling to “test the air,” raising the whisk as totem). Motivation is consistent—honoring unseen labor—and her micro‑choices align. Change is subtle but earned: she crystallizes her purpose (“I see you”) and accepts anonymity as cost. Slight limitation: inner contradiction is gentle; pressure rarely forces a sharper trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation and a competent, particular interiority (“trembled—not from fear, but from the thrill of near-discovery”). The micro-choices (pressing the diamond, committing to the coordinates) align with her worldview. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond sorrow. The endurance/mission pivot reads earned but low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s motive—fidelity to the broken and opposition to Kael’s sterile unity—is vivid and consistent, and her decision to broadcast crystallizes her stance. Interiority is specific (“whiskey-rough” laugh; meteor-dust ink), though contradictions are light. The choice carries implied risk but the on-page cost remains soft. Secondary pressures (Kael’s rise, the rebels’ whisper) remain off-stage but effectively press.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct, embodied portrait with clear motive shift from survival to “translation.” Actions align with his ethos (repairing the box with jars; anonymous gifting) and culminate in an earned renunciation at the end. Internal contradiction is subtle (madness vs. purpose) rather than dramatized under acute pressure. Minor reliance on told backstory slightly flattens live conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive and embodied attention to tools and environment; her “logically emotional” calibration reads in action. Limited contradiction or felt flaw under pressure keeps her from transcending into complexity; she’s a near‑paragon. Exhaustion is the only visible cost. The mid‑crisis composure borders on ease, softening character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is crystalline and specific—she pursues a “patient revolution” by aligning the viaduct to lunar paths—yet on‑page micro‑choices under pressure are mostly summarized rather than dramatized. The inner contradiction (impatience transmuted into patience) is articulated and partially embodied, but not tested in a sharp present‑tense crucible. Her endurance functions as Earned Stasis, though the immediate cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Strong coherence, modest scarcity of live, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Her motive and method cohere, and her calm under pressure reads earned through embodied choices (measuring echo decay, placing the lantern, leaving it as anchor). The internal tension between her mother’s warning and her refusal of amnesia adds credible push–pull. Costs are present but subtle (professional dismissal, self‑burden via name tattoos). A sharper on‑page trade‑off under immediate threat could lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—atonement through painstaking craft—and his choices under pressure (study, realignment, restraint) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. Interiority is embodied (dusting porcelain “as if absolving,” dawn rituals) and avoids therapy‑speak. The final reconfiguration—granting himself a “second opinion”—feels earned by prior struggle. Slight neatness in the forgiveness beat trims the edge of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Zeta’s motive and temperament are vivid—steadily curious, irreverent, competent—and her micro‑choices (arrow insertion, humming through a cracked voice, slamming the trigger) align under pressure. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely doubts or wavers, so the crucible is more craft than conflict. Still, embodied moments (“voice cracked,” “slumped”) ground emotion credibly. The final stance—accepting a whisper as earned progress—reads earned if not morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is vivid and specific: she hunts ghosts, lies strategically, and chooses to trigger a resonance restore at 07:07. Interiority is textured (“silence in the archive screamed louder than alerts”) and her self‑deception is dramatized (“She even lied to herself”). Actions align with motives and reveal cost (risking job/sanity, refusing to report). Slightly summary‑driven at times, but emotion remains embodied via objects and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she’s “not here to enforce, but to reconstitute”—and her micro‑choices (which mirrors, when to press the shard, asking the final question) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile handling of the crystal and breath on glass. The internal contradiction (peacekeeper vs. wounded witness) is present but stays understated, limiting dramatic friction. The final acceptance of “enough” reads as earned endurance with a modest, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—terminal curiosity about endings—is specific and consistently dramatized through listening and risk. Her contradictory impulses (self-erasure vs. service; drift toward danger vs. care for others) coexist on the page, especially when she chooses the floe. Actions align with her psychology without therapy‑speak shortcuts. Minor convenience in her preternatural sensing skirts the mystical but is earned by established attentional practice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct, embodied motives: Elias’s patient, soil‑wise worldview meets Mara’s rigidity-with-ache. Micro‑choices (offering the burned edge; not pulling her up) reveal value hierarchy and restraint. The relationship shifts credibly from refusal to “differently,” with a felt cost—no neat reunion. A minor softness: a few thesis-y lines risk smoothing their contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (“to preserve the echo of wisdom”) drives every micro‑choice, with endurance/attention functioning as agency. The mask’s asymmetry seeds a credible internal duality (mystery vs. discipline) that colors action, though conflict is gentle rather than testing. Embodied perception is strong (palming the stone; breath woven into the clearing). The cost is light (spent focus/surrender), but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s motive—transmutation of communal pain—is clear and consistent, embodied in her tactile attention to each photograph. Interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; we see reverence and patience, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. Micro‑choices (linger, trace, replace, select another photo) are present but low‑stakes. The closing endurance—returning tomorrow—reads as earned stasis with modest cost (solitude, time, “knees protesting”).

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation is precise and embodied: she seeks patterns of growth through acoustics, not data. The micro‑choice to stop transcribing and answer aloud reveals vulnerability and a shift in method. Internal contradiction is subtle (control vs. surrender), but not deeply dramatized in tussle. Still, her actions align cleanly with her long study and the moment’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he hunts the “sound of growing older” despite a curse that erases results—yielding a credible Earned Stasis. Interiority is embodied via tactile ritual (chalk screech, driftwood triangulation) and sensory specificity. The contradiction (precognition vs. forgetting) generates pathos without tidy resolution. Change is endurance rather than transformation, but it feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and particular—she seeks to harness the ephemeral—and her final renunciation of control is earned by the mentor’s credo and the spinning hand’s paradox. The internal contradiction (repairer vs. surrender) operates in scene and culminates in the leaf‑listening tactic. Embodied moments (fingers on brass; breath silenced; tears crystallizing) keep emotion concrete. Cost is felt as she accepts weightlessness over control, foreclosing the technician’s impulse to fix.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (a flawless goodbye via reunification) is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (using the broken vinyl shard; choosing to “hymn the mundane”). Interiority is specific and embodied in sensorial noticing rather than label‑speak. However, internal contradiction and real resistance are minimal; the piece skews toward serene mastery over struggle. The endurance/renunciation at the end (letting the shard dissolve) lands but with gentle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s motive is precise and persistent, and her measured micro‑choices (winding the forbidden key, repeating the ritual, stepping through) align with “quietly deliberate.” Interiority is clean and character‑particular, filtered through scholarly method. However, internal contradiction is muted; she rarely wavers or pays an explicit emotional price for assuming guardianship. The change at the end reads as a commitment with modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motive (“repair” over vengeance) and embodied micro‑choices (kneeling, planting/leaving the tooth) reveal a coherent, particular psyche. The “forgiving skeptic” contradiction plays credibly through pity versus myth. Internal tension is gentle rather than pressured, so cost registers more conceptual than visceral. Still, endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, embodied interiority (“each rotation a memory weighed not in grams, but in grief and grace”) grounds a credible vow and practice. Contradictory impulses (grief versus service; withdrawal versus witness) are present but remain largely harmonized rather than dramatized in friction on the page. Micro-choices—the restraint from flame, the choice to polish and to keep silence with villagers—align with motive. The endurance at the end reads as earned stasis with a quiet cost carried forward.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, embodied interiority and motivated micro‑choices (offering nectar; choosing to bury, not burn, the confession) reveal a precise hierarchy of values. The refusal to erase pain in favor of transformation reads as earned stasis with a felt cost. Contradictory impulses (sanctuary vs. hiding; protection vs. erasure) operate simultaneously. Minor abstraction in phrasing slightly distances peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, particular interiority and embodied choices (refusing to take notes, walking “sideways,” placing the shell down) reveal a coherent value hierarchy under pressure. The contradiction—writer who won’t write—acts on the page rather than as label. Cost is visible in renunciation (abandoning closure, letting the shell go) and a recommitment under new terms. Slight distance from concrete personal history keeps the portrait just shy of indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—remedy over invention—is clear and consistent, enacted through micro‑choices in how she plays (listening, shifting key, building to crescendo). Interiority is embodied via tactile, sensory attention (dew, oil, soil) rather than labels. The piece lacks a sharp internal contradiction or visible personal cost beyond restraint and reverence, keeping it shy of the top band. Still, the character reads specific and self‑defining under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular motivation and embodied patience anchor her choices; the blood-signature is a concrete, values-driven micro‑choice. However, internal contradiction is minimal—competence and serenity face little challenge beyond endurance. The cost (cold, blood) is felt but modest. Still, reactions to objects reveal a distinct temperament without stock cues.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he isn’t fixing time but preserving “wonder,” consistently embodied through tools (mirrors, prisms) and rituals. A quiet inner tension (fix vs. listen; fame vs. preservation) surfaces in lines like “not because he’d fixed anything, but because he’d remembered how to listen.” Interiority is sensorial rather than abstract, with tactile choices (sealing resin slabs, angling mirrors) revealing values. The lack of a sharper contradictory impulse under pressure keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation and vocation are precise and embodied; her constraint (“prison is her purpose”) manifests in specific micro‑choices (orienting the lamp, refusing smiles, choosing endurance). Interiority is lyric but concrete through tactile acts. The father functions as pressure rather than partner, but that’s apt at this length. The final renunciation (weaving her own burden) reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s motive—to “contain” grief—drives concrete micro‑choices under pressure (not rising to the kettle, choosing the chisel). Interiority is textured and particular (circus, Viktor’s laugh, the well‑used chisel). Contradictory impulses (haunting practicality vs. letting the kettle boil) read credibly. The earned renunciation at the end forecloses a path (domestic reflex) with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation and contradictory impulses are vivid and coherent—she both hoards others’ echoes and longs to face her own ghost. Micro-choices (climbing the spire, handing over the camera) align with a deepening need to reframe rather than fix. Embodied details (salt‑crusted planks, gestural language) keep emotions concrete. The closing renunciation reads earned with a felt cost: relinquishing the fix-the-past drive.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motive—revelation via redirected flows—is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (mounting the sextant, rerouting steam, installing kinetic tiles) align with it. Interiority is character‑particular, fusing engineering acuity with lyric perception. However, there’s little internal contradiction or genuine struggle; competence often meets minimal resistance. The ending shows an earned stance rather than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior is precise and embodied; his micro-choices (lifting the crystal, placing it on the chronometer, striking the tuning fork, choosing to hum) emerge from a coherent tension between renunciation and longing. The contradiction—devotion to silence vs. fossilized scores—acts in scene. The final renunciation (no resurrection of symphonies) reads as earned, not convenient. Slight softness: little resistance beyond his own hesitancy limits visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, particular interiority and micro-choices (not reaching, angling the sundial, waiting) reveal a disciplined seeker with credible motives. The renunciation at the end reads earned and character-specific. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—more patience than turmoil—keeping the arc quiet rather than combustive. Still, the felt cost of giving up the chase could be edged sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, embodied motives (patience, preservation) drive specific choices: the offering, the waiting, the request to “learn to read” knots. Interiority is precise and sensory-led rather than abstract. The relationship dynamic (supplicant vs. gatekeeper) is legible and evolves. Internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers, so complexity caps just below higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific interiority and embodied action (thread, damp stone, folding the crane) ground the traveler’s motive. Motivation is consistent—orientation over closure—culminating in a renunciation (no prayer/hope, only mapping). Internal contradiction is mild; the piece privileges steadiness over a thornier conflict. The endurance choice carries cost in solitude more than in a contested on‑page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single‑POV interiority is vivid and embodied: exhaustion versus defiant hope drives concrete acts (salvaging, calibrating, pressing his palm). Motivation is clear and persistent, with credible endurance under scorn and physical decay. The contradiction—ghost of regalia yet stubborn vow—animates the piece. Slight limit: few on‑page micro‑choices beyond activation reduce dynamic psychological turning.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rich, specific interiority and lived contradiction (firefighter/arsonist’s daughter) guide concrete choices—the ritual at the lagoon and the decision to answer Station 12’s call. Embodied details (“black sand clings to her knees”) anchor feeling over label. The renunciation is credible: she leaves the coin singing under water and returns to duty, choosing integration over hiding. Minor reduction for a few thesis-adjacent lines that edge toward overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation and a distinct worldview (“realistically imaginative”) guide concrete choices (taking the key, opening the box, moving on). Interiority is specific and embodied via method rather than label. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are light; she rarely struggles or missteps, keeping the arc more steady than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—refusing ancestral “fire” and choosing resonance—and actions (pings, singing, laying the gear down) align. Interiority is particular and embodied through tactile attention to the gear and the nebula’s response. The internal countercurrent (“peace felt fragile… might never be noticed”) adds needed tension but remains gentle rather than forcing a sharper micro‑choice. Change reads as an earned renunciation of fire with a quiet cost, not a dramatic fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (hands on grooves, breath as carving), and his choices (tying ribbons, carving strangers’ epitaphs, the final crimson ribbon) align with a coherent motive. The spectral mentor relationship reveals values without dialogue and culminates in a credible reorientation. Internal contradiction (“thundering calm”) is evocative but remains low-stakes; flaws and costs are gentler than elite-tier. Still, the arc to acceptance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s ethic of exactitude versus his late, costly surrender is embodied in tactile choices (hand on the bob; “He did not wind”). Interiority is precise and character‑particular, grounded in tools and textures. The shift from winder to witness credibly forecloses a long‑held identity. A hair of safety remains in how smoothly he attains grace, but it’s mostly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gardener’s inner drive is concrete and embodied through tactile choices (humming to threads, selecting the needle, stitching to reveal rather than repair). Contradictory impulses—blithe caretaker vs. steward of grief—coexist and sharpen in the silo. Her closing behavioral shift (from lullabies to questions) feels earned, though the visible cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatically tested. The arc is strong but could tighten with one on‑page price or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she climbs to map ignorance and “seed innovation within constraint”—and her micro‑choices (the dip, the questions as glyphs) align with that aim. The remembered failure and recalibration from “force grandeur” to “coax” adds credible history. However, on‑page internal contradiction under pressure is mild; she meets little resistance beyond ritual gravity. The visible cost reads conceptual rather than felt in a sharply dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, particular motivation (“teach dust to tell stories”) and embodied craft choices anchor her. Agency sharpens at the tear‑trigger reveal and the final decision to broadcast. Internal contradiction is present but light (discipline vs. vulnerability); a deeper on‑page struggle would lift it further. The scribing, calibration, and midnight ritual reveal character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Richly particular interiority and motive—she “paints absence” and refuses to remove the mask—yield credible micro‑choices (begin at the chair’s stillness, speak the hard truth, light the candle). Internal tension between truth and the mirage of safety is embodied rather than declared. Pressure from the visitor is brief but telling. The endurance choice at the end (mask stays on) carries felt cost, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is crystal and embodied—he chooses descent, refuses “reintegration,” catalogs artifacts, and enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost (isolation, squalor). Interiority is particular (“abrasive calm,” tile‑crack pacing, counter‑arguments) and consistent with methods-first thinking. Micro-choices around the cog, spitting at Council slogans, and climbing the bell tower reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The endurance resolution feels earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, her motives (seeking presence through silence, preserving harmony) embodied by tactile actions (tracing the rosette, humming, refusing to turn). The contradiction—expectant resignation vs. the risk of renewed teaching—reads credibly. The final choice to teach again is earned by years of endurance and a practiced method. Secondary character pressure is minimal but sufficient to reveal Elara’s values.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive and values are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (pruning vs. razing; watering with memory) reveal character. The reframing of vines from “enemies” to “archives” shows internal contradiction resolving in-scene. Cost is present but gentle (she parts with her own grief and intimacy), keeping the stakes quieter than maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive—preserving wonder—organizes his choices (curating riddles, leading the woman up, withholding broader disclosure) and reads consistent with his truth-bound flaw. The moment he admits he “guessed” and chose not to tell anyone gives him moral texture. Interiority is economical but specific, filtered through craft objects (matchboxes) and the tower. The cost of his choice is mostly conceptual, not dramatized against a concrete counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and motive—she tracks “the slow creep of the ordinary” and sanctifies thresholds—with embodied feeling (bare feet, palm to shard). Agency is evident in the ritual choice and how she reads the environment. Internal contradiction is minimal; she’s assured rather than conflicted, so pressure reveals priority more than fracture. The earned renunciation—leaving the shard to dissolve—registers as a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Both figures read as specific: the statue’s purpose-driven clarity and the historian’s wonder-led uncertainty create a credible crucible. The hesitation before breaking the ampoule is a clean micro-choice grounded in character. Interiority remains embodied (oxygen debt, tactile retrieval) rather than labeled. Slight limitation: the historian’s contradictions are delicately traced rather than deeply torn, keeping the arc strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular: he climbs to “capture the texture of a missed opportunity,” not to escape. Contradictory impulses (grim optimism; “balancedly daring”) govern calibrated micro‑choices—resting once, carving, then speaking proofs, and finally touching the reflection. Emotional embodiment is precise (die clicking as a “metronome of regret”). The ending’s renunciation—losing the die to carry the texture—reads as an earned, costly reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she paints to prove kindness is remembered—and her steady, ritualized choices align. Interiority is textured but largely unwavering; contradictory impulses are minimal. The meaningful on‑page choice is opening the door to the teen, exposing her sanctuary and method. Emotional embodiment via tactile ritual (skylight, ink, meteorite, chamomile) grounds her.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—rescuing dying arts—drives concrete choices (climbing behind the falls, baking letter‑bread, documenting glimmers). Interiority is specific (“lavender and grief”), but internal contradiction is modest; she rarely hesitates or pays a sharp personal price. The boy’s drum and the communal music give her actions reciprocal pressure. Change reads earned as she reframes from ghost‑seeking to framing living moments.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—he comes to “initiate the unraveling” and follows through decisively. Interiority is textured (“neatly inventive mind,” “bleak exhilaration”) with embodied reactions to the tools and setting. However, contradictory impulses are light; he rarely wavers, so the peak choice lands more as execution than contested renunciation. The visible cost (isolation, responsibility, structural damage) helps earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (“to trick fear into revealing its weakness”) meets embodied, specific interiority (hands plunging into chest for “echoes”). Contradictory impulses—terror and deliberate ritual—coexist on the page. Micro‑choices (reading aloud, unbosoming, thrusting memories at Fear) align with the arc. The advisor functions as a pressure‑agent rather than a mere expositor.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, embodied motivation—“turn obstacles into instruments”—drives every choice, and the mentor–apprentice dynamic adds lived pressure. Interiority is mostly enacted through craft rather than thought, which keeps mystery but limits contradiction on the page. The handoff to Kael is motivated and revealing. A deeper flicker of doubt or cost in the Prophet would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crisp and character‑particular: she’s powered by a private ache and professional obsession that drive concrete choices (testing the sequence, packing, deciding to climb). Interiority is textured through craft details (mapping on shell, whistle lexicon) rather than labels. Contradiction is present but subtle—quiet restraint versus audacious risk. The final stance (go at midnight regardless of sanction) feels fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, compelling motivation and a coherent inner compass (“emotionally rational”) guide concrete choices; tactile reactions (moss, brass, vellum) reveal character. Internal contradiction is muted—resolve outweighs doubt—so tension relies more on stance than struggle. Still, her calibrated strategy versus the lure of exposure reads specific and credible. The final poised refusal of triumph is earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—stitching memory against oblivion—flows from her “stoically sensitive” nature and is enacted through concrete micro-choices (slipping notes into mortar, copying the bride’s letter with the last ink). The internal tension between stoicism and tenderness culminates in the hushed, earned breakdown when she weeps. Actions align cleanly with her ethic of ritual rather than conquest. The endurance choice at the end (refilling and returning) reads as a credible, costly devotion rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Her motive (“to trace honest origins”) is clear and consistently enacted through concrete investigative choices. Interiority is specific and embodied (the stamp’s bite, smudged spectacles), showing competence without bravado. Internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers—so the crucible is endurance rather than a divided impulse. The closing renunciation (witness over condemnation) reads earned but low on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s grief-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and his choice to “transform the vessel” culminates in a concrete sacrifice (shattering lanterns, dropping the sapphire). Interiority is rendered through tactile craft and ritual rather than overt thought, which suits the piece but limits on-page contradiction. We glimpse layered emotion—devotion, obsession, and renunciation—without a fully dramatized internal debate. The cost reads, but the conflict remains mostly lyric rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Her motive—cartography of unused potential—feels specific and consistent, and her micro‑choices (slotting the geode, initiating the sequence, locking destination) align under pressure. Contradictory impulses (not hope but bleak pursuit) hum beneath the surface without tidy resolution. Embodied detail (mag‑boots, neural chair, forehead to glass) grounds grief. The lack of relational pressure on the page limits the crucible, keeping this just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—competence (thermal scans, micro‑pry) sits alongside wonder, tears, and a credible softening. The desire to decode belonging conflicts with the warning and her operator identity, producing a felt reorientation. However, the struggle is relatively low‑friction; danger never materially tests her. The pilgrim’s thematic confirmation edges toward tidy validation rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s motives and contradictions are concrete and embodied—she’s both complicit and craving relief, and her physical reactions (vomiting, trembling) ground the interior turn. Her micro‑choices—kneeling, selecting carvings, pressing the watch hand—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation/reorientation (to “become the sieve”) is earned by what she learns and pays for emotionally. A slight tilt toward declarative summation in the last paragraphs trims the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive and interiority drive concrete choices: she proposes neutral ground, refuses the list, demands memorized names, and trades relics. Contradictory impulses—old rage vs earned listening—register credibly. The relationship dynamic shifts from adversarial history to tentative co-creation and reads earned. A few aphoristic lines skate toward telling, but her actions anchor them.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (salt wind as “unresolved equations,” the washer as talisman), and her motive—align heart and action—drives concrete micro‑choices (naming poles, pocketing the washer, turning back to the kayak). Contradictory impulses (precision vs. surrender, regret vs. motion) operate simultaneously rather than sequentially. The shift from being “pinned” to pushing off reads earned, with a felt cost of relinquishing former identity and control. No therapy‑speak; emotional texture remains character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular: a hollowed seeker pursuing empathy as self‑rescue. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs need to believe the signature; refusal of redemption yet seeking feeling) act in scene. Micro‑choices under pressure—coming down, listening, tossing, and not retrieving—track to the core flaw. Kael adds proximate pressure without hijacking agency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation is crystalline (“to reforge a bond beyond death”) and her surrender reads as a credible, earned choice. Interiority is sensuous and embodied (“bone learning feather, blood learning flame”), giving specificity. The “reluctant metamorphosis” is declared and then quickly embraced; a sharper on‑page counter‑impulse or price would deepen complexity. Still, actions align with motives and culminate in a meaningful change with a felt cost of identity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: she seeks where “lost time accumulates” and makes specific, escalating choices (summon, enter, release). Contradictory impulses—reverence vs. despair; grasping vs. surrender—coexist and resolve credibly. Interiority is concrete via tactile ritual (shard, moss, roots, tattoo) rather than label-speak. The final renunciation (blessing and release) forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira’s pacifism drives tactics and costs, and her interior contradiction is dramatized in the shadow’s “carry me like a wing” turn. Embodied emotional calibration (light/heavy) grounds motives in action. The final acceptance of her darkness reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a tidy epiphany. Micro‑choices (stitching, song, apology) under pressure reveal a coherent value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is explicit and lived through action—she opens bottles to “understand the texture of transformation.” The fourth-bottle beat (her own unlived life entering her) gives a credible internal contradiction and cost. Interiority is specific and embodied (“tears evaporated…mist…like loyal cats”), not label-speak. The renunciation of the life she didn’t live reads as an earned, felt shift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Her motive and tactics are crystal clear and consistent—she protects silence to seed revolt with geometry—yet internal contradiction is minimal. The calm meticulousness (“never rushed, never reckless”) rings true and guides micro‑choices like aligning the gnomon and timing steps to the bell. A credible risk is present (guards within arm’s reach), but felt cost remains light. Strong, specific embodiment through objects (quill holder, sundial) reveals character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character-specific motive (to understand sacred patterns) drives concrete choices—placing stones, humming instead of speaking, refusing to “grab” in a frictionless world. The internal contradiction (curse steals awe vs. using it as a tool) is dramatized and resolves into an earned reconfiguration. Emotions are embodied via constraints (no friction, no speech) rather than labels. Cost is quiet but present: he renounces chasing surprise in favor of method.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich, embodied interiority and a credible contradiction—her ache to open the envelope versus her ritualized refusal—culminate in an earned renunciation. Micro‑choices (not resetting the timer, not opening the envelope) reveal values and cost. Emotions stay concrete (timer’s tick, lightning, brass, paper against ribs). A hair shy of perfection due to occasional thematic telling (“to rarefy was to…”).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, distinctive traits and motives (patience, rigor, “diplomatically fierce”) with small, telling behaviors (brass fingers, cuff seam) that reveal character under pressure. The relationship dynamic is crisp and respectful, shifting from rivalry to partnership on the page. However, internal contradiction and palpable struggle are light; competence dominates without a real test of limits. The final choice (“Now we perform it”) is credible but carries minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Molt’s interiority is rich and embodied; her sardonic shell versus emergent tenderness is dramatized through concrete choices (pinning the poem, lighting the candle, planting seeds, singing). Motivation (“rebuild” and honor Elias) is clear and intensifies as she acts. The transformation (“another molt begun, not by calendar but by grief”) reads earned and costs her a practiced cynicism. A hair more friction or self‑sabotage in the peak beats could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s goal is precise and her actions align: she maps the arbor, threads the reel, and chooses the risky final chord to defy fate. Interiority is conveyed through tactility (condensation on keys, the clock’s tick) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light—she’s unwavering more than conflicted—so complexity leans on craft and circumstance rather than ambivalence. The burned film and the charged poise at the end register a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s vocation, competence, and protective motive are clear and consistently dramatized through choice (selecting Elira, chanting, tracing glyphs). His doubt functions as live internal counterpressure rather than a label, peaking at “What if the seed absorbed not truth, but longing?” Actions align tightly to motive, with a tangible cost in spending the last seed. Slight limitation: external resistance is minimal after ignition, keeping his struggle mostly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elio’s motivation is clear and particular, and his micro‑choices (following the compass, executing the lace’s steps) align. Interiority is mostly conveyed through tactile ritual rather than conflict, so contradictory impulses are minimal. The competence/readiness flattens struggle, reducing felt cost. The bonsai coda reframes him but doesn’t expose a flaw under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s motivation is crystalline and her intellectual journey is compelling. However, her internal conflict feels more like a seamless philosophical transition than a struggle. The acceptance of her professional exile (“Reviewers dismissed her as poetic. She didn’t mind.”) is stated rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost of her transformation and making her final state feel slightly less hard-won than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation to find meaning after trauma is rendered with exceptional clarity and specificity. Her interiority is concrete, avoiding cliché; the insight "Survival... was subtraction" feels earned. The transformation from a state of rupture to one of purpose is fully dramatized through her sustained, disciplined actions, making the final state of being—living in the pause—credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation—to rectify the assumption that silence is absence—is both unique and deeply felt, rooted credibly in her trauma as a capsize survivor who lost her voice. Her interiority is conveyed through her precise, methodical actions rather than exposition, and her final, earned state of heightened perception feels both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.8)
    The undertaker's motivation is exceptionally clear, arising directly from his established profession and solitary existence. The shift from resigned weariness to purposeful action, sparked by his "inadvertently stubborn nature," constitutes a perfectly earned character arc for this length. His interiority is conveyed through concrete, embodied sensations—the aching molars, the trembling hands that still at the end—which makes his transformation visceral and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, dramatized rather than merely stated. Her choice to remain anonymous in the face of a direct question, and her final act of relinquishing the bell, demonstrate a powerful internal consistency. The story earns her final stance as a renunciation of a savior role, with the cost being her personal significance in favor of the community’s resilience, satisfying the 9+ test for earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    The artist’s motivation is singular, poetic, and powerfully established, driving the narrative with quiet intensity. Her interiority is rendered through concrete, character-particular perception rather than abstract labels; her skills feel earned, not convenient. The final act of surrender—matching the pilgrim's breath—is a perfect culmination of her established traits, a micro-choice that pays off her entire backstory with a visible, transformative result.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elira’s motivation is singular, compelling, and refreshingly abstract: to know the "texture of time." The story successfully dramatizes this internal goal, showing her progression from intellectual pursuit to a devastating but fulfilling sensory apotheosis. Her final shift from despair over her lost memories to embracing her new reality is earned by the story’s climactic turn, demonstrating a complete and costly character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The liberator's motivation to "plant resilience" is not just stated but embodied in every action, from her calloused fingers to her choice to plant spores before even confirming her own escape. Her core trait—a blend of fierce patience and strategic grace—is demonstrated through the central puzzle, creating a character who reads as an elemental force rather than a standard revolutionary. Her competence is balanced by her physical vulnerability (the chains), making her choices feel weighty and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, potent, and rooted in specific loss. Interiority is exceptional, expressed through the unique sensory filter of hearing colors, which beautifully embodies her emotional state. The final shift from grief to purpose is earned, though the line "marveling at the alchemy of grief turned into guidance" borders on self-aware, diagnostic summary, slightly abstracting the otherwise concrete emotional progression in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and her methods are consistent, creating a memorable character portrait. However, her unwavering competence and the lack of any internal contradiction or meaningful struggle prevent the characterization from reaching the highest tier. Her success feels preordained, which slightly flattens her journey; a moment of doubt or a miscalculation would have added crucial depth.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glassblower's motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic detail. The final change to a "pliant, glowing" heart is earned through her ritualistic actions. The characterization is nearly flawless, though it occasionally veers into being an avatar for the theme, such as when her voice is explicitly described as knowing "drama lends dignity to drudgery."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation and internal conflict between fear and resolve ("trembling certainty") are powerfully rendered and consistent. The change is earned through on-page action. However, the character's interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate self-analysis, such as, "I outwitted him to prove that even the most broken, trembling thing...can turn betrayal into liberation," which reads more like a thematic summary than an authentic internal state, slightly flattening the earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a motivation that is both singular and deeply particular. The oracle's obsession with "the architecture of absence" is not just a label; it's a complete worldview demonstrated through her actions and perceptions. The final choice to enter the charted territory is a perfect, earned culmination of her life's work, showing a credible endurance and renunciation of the ordinary world with the felt cost of decades of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    The robot’s motivation is singular, clear, and explored with unusual depth. Its interiority is established with poetic precision ("settled like frost on glass"), avoiding cliché. The final change—from questioning to belonging—is earned through the story's recursive structure, and the cost is made tangible by the violin's dissolution. This is a masterful execution of a non-human character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's motivation is consistently dramatized through her quiet, deliberate actions. Her internal state is conveyed through her handling of objects, and the change—her final, unguarded smile—is earned by the preceding vulnerability. The secondary characters' reactions are brief but specifically embodied, making their transformation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.6)
    The vine dresser’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her actions and interiority. The philosophy of reciprocity is not just stated but embodied in the wisely pragmatic rhythm of her hands and her quiet defiance. The final choice to dismiss the intern is a perfect culmination of forty-seven springs of earned conviction, making her endurance feel both monumental and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves credibly from a desire to prove a theory to a need to map a new reality. Her defining trait, "mechanically warm," is demonstrated through her calm, methodical actions under pressure, such as bypassing safety protocols with a "sigh—not recklessness, but necessity." The internal conflict between scientific curiosity and the terror she sees in her double’s eyes is powerfully understated, earning the final shift in her objective.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The musician’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, rooted in an aesthetic philosophy of “absences” that feels particular and earned. Her interiority is rendered through concrete actions and perceptions, avoiding generic summary. The final change—achieving her purpose—is a direct result of her unwavering resolve, which, while powerful, presents a character so focused that it limits the potential for visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elira's internal conflict is dramatized through her interaction with the illustration—a tangible record of her longing, fever, and error. Her motivation is clear and her final shift toward acceptance is earned through the crucible of the scene. The choice to pin the drawing is a powerful act of agency, demonstrating a change from evasion to endurance with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s core contradiction—a skeptical mind performing a believer’s pilgrimage—is dramatized with precision, not just stated. Her motivation of “calibration” is a sophisticated and credible engine for the plot. The final shift to acceptance is earned through the shocking on-page discovery, making her change feel both sudden and inevitable, a hallmark of powerful short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The keeper’s character is defined by a powerful, coherent motivation that is tested and deepened, not just stated. The internal shift from a passive witness to one who must “release” the weight of that vision is an earned change. The final understanding of witnessing as love provides a strong emotional closure, though the character remains more of a resonant archetype than a deeply particular individual.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align perfectly with her established character. The portrayal is strong, but lacks a dramatized internal conflict; her mission to "nurture wonder" is a stated goal rather than a value tested against a contradictory impulse within a scene. Her competence and gentle soul are beautifully rendered, but the absence of a visible flaw or internal friction keeps the characterization just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The historian's motivation is established with poetic precision and evolves beautifully. The shift from a passive "collector" to an active "weaver" is a profound and earned change, culminating in the story's final, resonant smile. Her interiority is revealed entirely through her focused actions and perceptions, avoiding any explanatory summary and fulfilling the 9+ quick test of an earned final stance with a clear, felt cost—the monumental task she is accepting.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias’s motivation to “transpose life into a new key” is both unique and consistently dramatized through his meticulous actions. The core character contradiction—appearing as a mystical oracle while functioning as a rational orchestrator—is the story's engine. His final choice to accept the analyst is an earned renunciation of solitude, showing a clear character evolution with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    The priest's characterization is nearly flawless for a concept-driven piece. His motivation—illumination, not exorcism—is established early and provides a consistent, compelling logic for his unconventional tactics. The internal conflict is clear as he wields intellectual tools against a visceral threat. His final micro-choices, particularly dipping his thumb into the indigo to paint the question mark, are earned, decisive, and perfectly aligned with his established traits, demonstrating a credible shift from analysis to action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is both deeply felt and precisely rendered, established immediately with "chronologically homesick" and culminating in the ambition "to become the conductor of unheard symphonies." Her internal conflict—the need to engage painful memories to create meaning, despite the cost—is powerfully dramatized in the climactic scene. The final action, a simple smile for having "remembered how to try," is a perfectly calibrated emotional shift, earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and compelling, with her internal state made concrete through the labyrinthine journey. Her final choices feel earned by the preceding trials. However, the climactic confession "I am not one path. I am the branching. The fracture. The recursion" veers into diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the emotional peak by articulating the theme directly rather than embodying it in a final, visceral action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation—the fear of a spreading internal void—is both deeply felt and directly tied to her unique sensory experience as a deaf person. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied specifics, avoiding any diagnostic summary. The final choice to repeat the backward song is not a simple victory, but an earned acceptance of a difficult, ongoing practice, demonstrating a profound and credible character shift with a clear cost: confronting raw pain instead of seeking a simple cure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's meticulous nature is established professionally ("pressure gradients and wind vectors") and then demonstrated personally in his methods (sketching the courtyard, noting data). The core internal conflict between nurturing integrity in solitude and the need for action is clear, credible, and drives the entire narrative to its potent conclusion. The final choice is earned by prior causality, and the cost—the loss of safe solitude—is made explicit and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong. The protagonist's motivation is clear, her internal conflict is embodied in the contrast between her professional caution and her personal need, and her emotional progression feels earned. The choice to open the vial is a powerful micro-choice with a visible cost. The final transformation is credible, though the self-awareness in the last few paragraphs slightly lessens the impact of her embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies too heavily on direct statements rather than dramatized action. Phrases like "She was ethically playful" are told, not shown, making her feel more like a philosophical vessel than a person with embodied, contradictory impulses. Her core change is earned, but the character lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently dramatized through her actions. Her interiority is revealed through a unique perceptual filter—acoustic sensitivity—that avoids cliché. The final micro-choice, a smile not of triumph but of tenderness, is a perfectly embodied and earned emotional beat that confirms her creed. A sharper, more active internal contradiction in-scene, beyond the philosophical stance, could have elevated this to a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    Vael’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a powerful internal contradiction between transactional professionalism and a buried desire for fusion. The transformation is earned through embodied experience, not intellectual epiphany, culminating in a decisive choice with a visible cost ("The market will call her ruined"). The final smile, contrasted with the "practiced curve she once sold," provides a perfect, concrete image of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal shift from shrewd broker to purveyor of compassion is made credible by the "whimsically attentive" trait. The core contradiction between his professional life and his secret mission is well-maintained. His final stance—listening rather than acting—represents a fully earned character change, with the cost being his previous transactional worldview replaced by a new sense of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear and viscerally established from the start. Her transformation from a pleading seeker to a welcoming "grafting point" is earned and compelling. The characterization is weakened slightly by the final description of her as "the one who braided loneliness into bridges," which feels more like an authorial thematic summary than a concrete, embodied piece of interiority, nudging toward diagnostic label-speak at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The illustrator’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives every action. Her interiority is rendered through embodied experience—the cold pendant, the warmth of borrowing time, the clarity gained through fatigue—which avoids abstract emotional labels. The moment of near-failure ("She’d overborrowed") creates a believable moment of struggle that highlights her competence when she sculpts time to avert disaster, satisfying the test of contradictory impulses acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elira’s motivation for comprehension over reunion is established immediately and her actions—calibrating with glass eyes, dovetailing equations with memories—are specific, inventive, and perfectly aligned with her character. The internal conflict between her analytical approach and her underlying grief is shown, not told, culminating in an earned emotional release. Her competence is balanced by a vulnerability that makes the final shift from grief to startled laughter feel authentic and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is profound and consistently dramatized through her actions, shifting from private reverence to public offering. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion, particularly the “warmth spreading through her ribs” and the final tears, which feel earned. The character arc from seeking visibility to understanding it as resonance is compelling and lands with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's internal conflict between scientific rigor and intuitive awe is embodied in specific, revealing actions like naming the leaf "Lindy" as a "circuitously sincere gesture." The transformation is earned through a clear progression of choices, culminating in a renunciation of her old self that feels both costly and necessary. Her flaws—obsession, intellectual pride—directly drive the central conflict, making the resolution feel inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The painter’s motivation is established immediately and compellingly (“to thresh meaning from experience”), and her “wryly earnest demeanor” provides a perfect internal conflict between her rational training and the supernatural events. Her contradictory impulses are dramatized beautifully when she whispers “apologies to the brooch before each stroke.” The final change in her, from desperate archivist to active participant in a legacy, is earned by the discovery of the journal and culminates in a costly, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clairvoyant’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-drawn, particularly the contradiction between her outward smile and twitching fingers. However, her arc pivots on a passive event—a vision that "tore through her"—rather than a difficult choice made under pressure. This deus ex memoria slightly lessens the impact of her final earned understanding, making the change feel more received than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and dramatized through her unique methodology. Her actions are a direct, earned expression of her character. The portrait is nearly flawless, though a single moment of embodied internal conflict or self-doubt amidst her serene competence could have elevated it from exceptional to perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is singular and potent, driving the narrative with credible force. Her defining trait, “analytically artistic,” is demonstrated effectively through her symphony-like mental maps and charcoal-and-calculus methods, avoiding a mere label. The internal conflict culminates in a moment of “reverence” before the final dare, a subtle but powerful contradiction to her usual analytical approach. The final transformation from mapper to listener is earned through the preceding trials, making her change feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira's characterization is clear and consistent. The central contradiction of the "sympathetic skeptic" provides a solid internal conflict, and her motivation to "sculpt space for reflection" is beautifully realized in the story's resolution. The war between skepticism and sensation is felt, though its resolution is perhaps a bit swift. The attribute "courageously kind" feels slightly more asserted than dramatized with a tangible cost, which holds the score just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The immortal’s motivation is crystalline and drives the narrative, but the characterization, while elegantly phrased, relies on the familiar archetype of cosmic ennui. The backstory involving the warlock adds a welcome touch of specific ruthlessness. However, the in-scene interiority lacks contradictory impulses, presenting a polished emotional state rather than a deeply conflicted one under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation—to find "the mathematics of a fair trade"—is both unique and deeply felt, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The internal conflict of being an "honest child" to a "con artist" is expertly dramatized, culminating in the potent declaration, "I'm the con's conscience." The character's transformation from a watchful observer to an active architect of fairness is earned and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stationer’s motivation is singular and clear, and her climactic choice to leave the notepad is a perfectly earned evolution from solitary collector to hopeful collaborator. The interiority is rich and specific, with emotions embodied in action ("Her pencil froze," "wept—not from sorrow, but recognition"). The character arc is compact but resonant, with the final choice carrying the felt cost of her relinquished solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, rooted in a highly specific and consistently executed motivation. The abstract goal—to seek “texture”—is made concrete through Elias’s focused actions and perceptions. His internal state is not merely summarized but fully embodied in the lyrical prose, making his quiet endurance feel monumental rather than passive.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation—a grief-fueled quest disguised as an intellectual riddle—is both clear and complex. Her internal conflict is powerfully embodied in the ritualistic actions with the shell and cello, and her final shift from seeking external answers to accepting internal silence is earned by the story’s climax, with the cost felt in the shattering of her sacred tools.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her backstory adds compelling depth. The internal conflict of "dual allegiance" is well-established as a premise but feels more stated than dramatized through a contradictory choice in a key moment; her actions on the page are consistently aligned with the carnival, making the ache of her allegiance a character note rather than a crucible that forces a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established with lyrical precision—“drawn by a quiet ache”—and her internal arc is both subtle and complete. The shift from a professional mission (“photograph the last”) to a spiritual one (“communion,” “keeping vigil”) is earned through observation, not declaration. Her final micro-choice to leave the label, “Beauty intact,” is a perfect crystallization of her changed perspective, representing an earned stasis with a clear, felt cost of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, conveyed through a masterful and consistent non-visual sensory filter. Her motivation is clear and her actions are aligned, embodying a "magnetic calm" that feels earned rather than stated. The only minor weakness is the slightly over-articulated philosophical statement of her purpose ("to decode feedback into direction... for machines and for souls"), which verges on telling, but her embodied actions throughout the piece are strong enough to mostly overcome this.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's voice is distinct, consistent, and established immediately with the line "Took you long enough, feathered bureaucrat." The "dry-witted" and "subtly confident" traits are not merely stated but demonstrated through precise interiority and action, making the final, almost spiritual act of witnessing feel earned by a lifetime of pragmatic obsession. The internal conflict between the nitpicking editor and the seeker of myths is beautifully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist is a perfectly executed archetype, a vessel for the story's magic. Her motivation is clear and her actions are absolutely consistent. However, she lacks the internal conflict, flaws, or contradictory impulses required for the highest tier of characterization; she is an instrument, not a person wrestling with a choice, which is a valid but limiting stylistic decision.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central internal conflict between survival instinct and the quest for revelation is not just stated but dramatized with visceral force in the climax. Elira’s final choice to renounce survival for her goal is earned and poignantly rendered, making her a compelling, self-determined figure whose cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and rooted in his lineage, driving every action. His final choice to kneel and say "I believe you" is a powerful, earned emotional beat that pays off his entire purpose. The characterization is slightly held back from the highest tier only by the lack of a significant, dramatized internal contradiction in the moment of action; his drive is singular and unwavering, which is effective but less complex than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghost bride's motivation is clear and compelling, and her contradictory nature ("lovingly venomous") provides a strong conceptual core. Elara's characterization is weaker; her key realization ("the debt was never punishment; it was balance") feels more like an authorial thematic statement delivered through her than an earned, embodied epiphany, slightly flattening the emotional climax for her character.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The weaver's motivation is established with poetic precision ("because silence had grown too heavy to wear") and embodied in her "needle-scars, each a vow." The internal conflict between her "hauntingly optimistic" drive and her family's history of fear is dramatized through her singular, defiant action. Her final choice to forge a new path is an earned culmination of the ritual, demonstrating a powerful, internally consistent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, driving her micro-choices with specificity (listening vs. plundering). Her interiority is concrete, shifting from "cautious enchantment" to earned emotional release. The character arc from diaspora returnee to the orchard's "quiet compass" is fully realized, with her final state of rootedness representing a clear, earned change with the felt cost of her former wandering identity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and poignant, rooted in the backstory of the misrouted letter. Her interiority is consistently rendered through her actions and philosophy, avoiding any diagnostic labels. The character’s defining contradiction—using ephemeral, playful children’s games to encode permanent, heavy adult emotions—is the story's powerful engine, and her final stance of quiet endurance is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the plot's mechanics. The protagonist’s core trait—disguising wisdom as foolishness—is not just an attribute but a causal plot device, demonstrated perfectly when the conspirators dismiss her. Her motivation is clear and her actions are a direct, consistent expression of her unique skills, culminating in an earned stasis that feels both powerful and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with poetic precision and her internal conflict between regret and the need for release is embodied in every action. Her micro-choice to smudge "afraid" into "alive" is a superb, active demonstration of her shifting internal state. The final change is earned and resonant, fulfilling the story's initial premise with a powerful sense of earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is vivid and consistent. Mira’s motivation to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” is compelling and drives her every micro-choice, from kneeling to decrypting the cast. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through concrete, specific metaphors tied to her profession. The final shift in understanding her ache as “kinship” is an earned change, a believable evolution for a character saturated in vicarious trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and deepens satisfyingly from a professional goal (displaying a fragment) to a personal one (rediscovering joy). The internal conflict between creation for acclaim and creation for its own sake is palpable and resolves with an earned epiphany. The final choice to return and "paint new joys" feels like a genuine, costly transformation, foreclosing her old, burdened artistic path.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by the ‘methodically playful’ trait that is dramatized rather than merely stated. Her motivation undergoes a sophisticated repricing, shifting from a professional curiosity to a profound, earned desire “to be un-fixed.” The internal conflict between certainty and wonder is flawlessly externalized through her actions, culminating in a change that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly in its economy. The scholar's motivation is established with a single, potent backstory fragment about her father, and her core trait ("candidly cryptic") is dramatized rather than stated. The standout moment is Dr. Vex's turn; his motivation, revealed through the memory of his mother's lullaby, is both surprising and deeply credible, providing a powerful, unstated alliance that drives the second half of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction of "shyly unstoppable" is not just stated but fully dramatized through her actions—fearing audiences yet whispering verses to the wind. Her motivation is singular and potent, and her interiority is conveyed through rich, embodied imagery rather than abstract labels. The final shift is a subtle but earned deepening of her resolve, a perfect example of credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.5)
    The caretaker's motivation is exceptionally clear and embodied. Her character is revealed through disciplined action, adherence to principles learned from her grandmother and the failures of others, and a nuanced internal state. The final beat—a smile of "quiet satisfaction of a vow kept" rather than simple joy—is a masterful, earned expression of character, demonstrating a complex interiority that grapples with loss and duty without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, moving beyond simple academic curiosity to a profound, society-level goal. Her defining trait of being "carefully reckless" is not just stated but demonstrated through the contradictory actions of a celebratory fist-pump followed by meticulous double-checking. This internal conflict is embodied and makes her drive feel authentic and compelling, earning the story's powerful emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation to "harmonize conflicting values" is a sophisticated and compelling internal driver. Her "slyly heartfelt" methodology is demonstrated consistently through her actions, culminating in the plan to hide mercy within efficiency metrics. The internal conflict is vivid, and her final state of "dappled resolve" feels earned and psychologically true, avoiding a simplistic triumphant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and deepens from a professional goal (preservation) into a personal one (recovering her mother’s song). The internal conflict between her habitual erasure of the past and her desire to preserve it is potent. The final change—accepting her history as a "composition"—is earned through her on-page actions, and the cost is made tangible by the image of the open ledgers.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, driven by a highly specific and compelling motivation rooted in her unique upbringing. Her interiority is concrete and distinct, avoiding clichés; emotions are embodied in her actions, like tracing the bench's grain. The final choice is a perfect culmination of her "featherly determination," a credible and costly transformation earned by every preceding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation to find “the rhythm of belonging” is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is specific and evocative, filtering the world through her unique lens as a "landscape astrologer." The final shift from lonely seeker to someone possessing a rhythm to share is earned through the climactic encounter, representing a credible change with a felt cost—the shedding of a familiar, solitary identity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.4)
    The recollectionist’s characterization is superb, driven by a consistent and potent interiority. Her transformation from a seeker of answers to a carrier of mysteries is earned through the story’s central revelation, and her emotional state—a mix of delight and sorrow—is embodied rather than declared. The central contradiction of "cheerful gloom" provides a strong, specific core to her personality, making her final choice to "carry" the mystery feel both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. His character is revealed through his precise, clockmaker-like movements and philosophical stance. However, the performance is so flawlessly competent that it lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or a contradictory impulse in-scene, which keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority conveyed through potent, embodied language. The protagonist's transformation from fugitive to teacher is earned by a climactic act of will with a visible physical cost ("feet bled faintly into the moss"). Her final choice feels both surprising and inevitable, fulfilling the story's core promise without sentimentalism.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glazier’s characterization is exceptional, with a motivation that is both clear and profound. His interiority is specific and philosophical, avoiding cliché ("he listened to physics, to resonance"). The brief reflection on his father is perfectly integrated, anchoring his worldview without stalling momentum. The final micro-choice to visit Widow Hargrove provides a perfect, active expression of his core drive.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The firefighter's motivation is deeply rooted in his personal losses, creating a powerful internal landscape that justifies his ritual. The core contradiction—his own fear versus his resolve to offer comfort—is beautifully embodied in the line, "Yes. I’m afraid. And that’s why I stay." His final choice to leave his own letter feels earned, a natural culmination of his internal journey from carrying a burden to embracing a purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a philosophical stance on hope as a solvable structure. Her interiority is concrete and particular to this worldview. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she reads as a perfectly calibrated instrument for the story's concept rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Lines like "None of it broke her. Instead, it refined her" summarize resilience rather than dramatizing the struggle, which keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established with lyrical precision and remains the story's anchor. Her interiority is beautifully embodied, particularly the act of listening "with the hollow behind her ribs." The final choice to leave her sketch rather than just record is an earned, decisive act that shows a profound character shift from cartographer to witness, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for a costly, earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character is a well-realized archetype, and her motivation is consistently dramatized through her actions. Interiority is poetic and particular ("the hollow between her ribs"). However, the story forgoes dramatizing a sharp internal conflict; her "perceptively calm" reaction to seeing her own past in the mirror is a valid character choice but mutes the potential for showing contradictory impulses in a moment of high personal stakes, keeping the score just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction between decades of weariness and a core of relentless conviction. Her motivation is made concrete through action, not just reflection. The shift from mustering her own conviction to mustering that of the soldiers is earned and compelling, with the final choice to reframe the treaty as a "mirror" emerging directly from her established worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb, establishing the central contradiction of the "amoral philanthropist" with startling efficiency. The motivation, rooted in a "secretly sentimental" connection to his mother, is both clear and poignant, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The final change—feeling "clean"—is earned through the preceding ritual, representing a credible, if temporary, shift in his internal state, making the cost of his public life all the more resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The motivation for "resonance" over vengeance or justice is clear and compelling, and her core trait—"her body was not flesh to be claimed, but verse to be deciphered"—is not just stated but embodied in her patient, rhythmic actions. The final choice to whisper "I remember you" feels like an inevitable, earned culmination of this philosophy, making her a fully realized, if archetypal, figure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s central contradiction—aesthetic grace versus moral evasion—is powerfully established by Mira’s line, “You make poison look like calligraphy.” The arc from a cultivated serenity to an earned one is fully realized, and the final choice to create a new, painfully honest puppet show is a perfect, costly embodiment of his change. The use of a self-puppet with shattered mirror eyes is a masterful touch of concrete interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently embodied through her actions, creating a powerful portrait of devotional practice. Her defining paradox, "transiently rooted," is beautifully dramatized. The characterization is held back from the highest tier only by a lack of significant internal conflict in-scene; she arrives with a fully formed philosophy and executes it with serene purpose, making her more of a vessel for the theme than a character tested by contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a past self ("hollow gods") and a new purpose. The internal state is vividly rendered, though lines like "...that fierce, thawing tenderness that comes when you stop burying the past and start giving it breath again" verge on diagnostic self-awareness, explaining the emotion rather than purely embodying it. The final change is earned, but this tendency toward over-articulation slightly tempers the character's raw interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal conflict—the paralysis of foresight and hindsight—is beautifully embodied in her actions. The change she undergoes is earned through the story's central event, and her final state feels like a genuine transformation. The "precisely playful" character trait is introduced and then effectively reprised in the climax, linking her philosophy to a decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.6)
    The astronomer's characterization is exceptional, defined by a core, elegant contradiction: a rational mind pursuing a mystical aim through empirical means. His motivation—"encrypted devotion"—is not just stated but embodied in every frugal, precise action, from selling his cloak to logging the result with stoic calm. The final choice to simply record the data, rather than exult, is a perfectly earned culmination of a personality defined by quiet, profound dedication over spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    The characterization is strong and specific, rooting the "scheming pacifist" in a concrete internal contradiction. Motivation is clear and embodied through physical sensations like a "clenched jaw" and "stiff shoulders." The final shift feels earned. A minor deduction is for moments where interiority veers into thematic summary ("pacifism required more cunning than war"), which reads more like authorial thesis than a character's immediate thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mirror maker’s motivation is established immediately and deepened by the poignant, single-line reflection, “She had once been that child.” Her character is revealed entirely through her precise, reverent actions and her internal state, which avoids cliché by being grounded in her craft (“glass mountains — that was the tone she carried in her marrow”). The final choice to capture the dream, not with force but with a gentle exhale, is earned by her established understanding of its nature, fulfilling the 9+ test of contradictory impulses (control vs. empathy) resolving with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The mender’s motivation is clear, poignant, and consistent. Her blend of stubbornness, grief, and professional pride is shown through concrete action, such as smiling at her daughter’s inherited feistiness even as it pains her. The final choice to pack the green scrap is a perfect, earned micro-action that demonstrates her renewed hope without any need for summary. The contradictory impulses—love for her daughter's spirit, pain from its rejection—are held in beautiful tension.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.4)
    The curator’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear and compelling intellectual motivation that feels bone-deep. Her internal state is rendered with concrete, unique imagery, such as the Archive's silence humming "like a tuning fork left ringing too long." The transformation from "bewildered" to "awake" is earned through the story's central revelation, and the cost of this new knowledge is beautifully embodied in the final lines, settling into her "like a second skeleton." The character is an individual, not a type, and her specific way of thinking ("simply complicated") drives the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's characterization is exceptional, driven by a consistent and demonstrated motivation. Her expertise as a linguist isn't just a label; it shapes her every perception and action, from sensing "linguistic strata" to her final, resourceful choice. The contrast with Kael effectively highlights her unique competence, and her quiet, patient nature feels earned rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, carried by a specific and compelling interiority. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively, particularly in the hesitation before accepting the name *Lirien*, weighing wholeness against fracture. The final choice feels earned, arising from the established trait of being "blissfully aberrant," and represents a credible, complex resolution rather than a simple victory.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist is a consistent and well-defined archetype, and her motivation is perfectly aligned with her actions. However, her characterization leans on description ("warmly methodical nature") rather than dramatized internal conflict. She lacks discernible flaws or contradictory impulses, making her feel more like a perfect instrument for the plot's resolution than a complex individual; her competence is absolute and unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ripple-mark's motivation is crystalline and her actions align perfectly with it. Her character is revealed through her unique methodology and serene competence. The concept of a "stillness forged by pressure, not granted by peace" is a potent and earned character note at the end. However, she reads as a near-perfect instrument for the story's theme, lacking the internal contradictions or flaws that would elevate her from a beautifully rendered archetype to a more complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    The custodian’s motivation is established with superb clarity and drives every action on the page. The final emotional shift from a seeker of proof to a conduit of meaning is profound and earned through the dramatized ritual. Her concluding emotion—"thistle-blown hope"—is a specific, embodied, and non-clichéd resolution that perfectly captures her character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.6)
    The archivist’s motivation is singular, clear, and executed with profound interiority. The recurring trait “preemptively nostalgic” is not a static label but an active lens that shapes her perception and culminates in an earned, resonant shift when applied to herself. Her actions are perfectly aligned with her abstract goal, making a conceptual character feel grounded and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is powerfully established and her interiority is rendered through specific, embodied action rather than summary. Her expertise as a pyrotechnist consistently informs her perception and choices, making her a highly specific and credible character. The final choice to sacrifice the talisman feels earned, and her emotional progression from solemn pilgrimage to reclaimed joy is compelling, culminating in a change that feels both significant and authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The chronicler's motivation is both abstract and deeply felt, and her internal conflict between solitary contemplation and relational duty is dramatized effectively. The shift in her perception of her companion—from "counterweight" to "fellow traveler"—is an earned and powerful change, a direct result of her on-page struggle and insight. Her final actions are a perfect expression of her character's earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The child's motivation is crystalline and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Interiority is rendered with poetic specificity, particularly the central conceit of "collecting the flavors of different silences." The primary weakness is the moment of epiphany ("They understood then..."), which veers into diagnostic self-awareness, slightly flattening the earned, embodied realization with an intellectual summary just before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.5)
    The operator's characterization is exceptional, conveyed through precise, empathetic actions rather than exposition. His motivation is rooted in a specific, lived-in philosophy, and his internal state is shown by how he interacts with his tool and environment. The brief backstory involving his grandmother provides depth without stalling momentum, perfectly anchoring his competence and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is effective for an archetype, with a clear motivation that drives every action. The final choice to accept the version of herself "who sallied forth" provides a strong, earned internal closure. However, the protagonist's interiority remains somewhat abstract, relying on labels like "wisely adventurous" rather than fully dramatizing the internal contradiction or struggle that makes such a trait necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and specific, driven by a clear, albeit abstract, motivation. Interiority is well-embodied through sensory details like the chill of the doorknocker and the taste of the air. A slight weakness lies in moments that verge on diagnostic self-awareness, such as "Linking through scars was her method—not metaphor, but mechanism," which tells the reader the story's conceit directly rather than letting it be fully inferred through action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation, rooted in the specific trauma of a pyramid scheme, is exceptional and consistent. The choice to act not from faith but from "spite for every empty promise" provides a complex, authentic engine for the plot. The transformation from a cynical survivor to an active tender of "quantum promises" is earned through the climactic confrontation with her past, showing a contradictory impulse (skepticism vs. hope) resolved into a new, stable stance with a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb. The protagonist’s motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with specific, compelling language (“mused, not as poets do in gardens, but as hunters do before thekill”). Her core contradiction—a destroyer who is actually a restorer—is revealed and resolved in a single, powerful beat. The final earned change is both credible and profound, foreclosing her old path with the full conceptual cost of her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.5)
    The knight’s characterization is exceptional, executing a complete and earned internal transformation entirely through action and embodied perception. The central contradiction between his rigid, silent exterior and the fluid, surrendered state he seeks is powerfully dramatized. His motivation is clear and abstract—“to capture the shape of possibility”—but his actions to achieve it are concrete and costly, culminating in a final laugh that lands with the force of a profound, earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s motivation is powerfully established, rooted in a personal sorrow that sharpens her professional focus. Her internal conflict is palpable, and the shift from preserving loss to resurrecting kindness feels earned, not sentimental. The character arc is completed with a credible transformation, where pain is repurposed rather than erased—a sophisticated and emotionally honest resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and tightly integrated. The core trait of being "carefully resourceful" is consistently demonstrated through action—from salvaging tools to her meticulous methods—rather than just being stated. Her motivation is potent and clear, and her final choice to broadcast the truths results in an earned transformation from "ghost" to "reckoning" with the clear, felt cost of her anonymity and safety.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)
    The saxophonist's motivation is primal and clear, rooted in family legacy and a specific, existential threat. His interiority is conveyed with poetic precision, particularly in the translation of abstract goals into physical action—"softened his attack, let the notes dissolve." The character's competence is balanced by the clear resistance from the prophecy, making his final success feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional. Her singular motivation is established immediately and her internal state is conveyed through concrete, specific actions like building monuments and her recurring feeling of "mossy delight." The transformation from a quiet decoder to a public conduit for memory is earned through her patient reverence, and the final state of being "transformed always" carries the cost of her former solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is established with poetic precision in the first two sentences and undergoes a complete, earned transformation. The internal conflict between seeking order and embracing chaos is dramatized through his journey, not just summarized. The act of tossing his father’s watch is a perfect synthesis of choice, cost, and character change, foreclosing his past with a single, resonant action that satisfies the high-band criteria for an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation for redemption is powerfully established and her internal conflict between rigid balance and compassion is the story's engine. The final transformation to "Elara the Mended" is earned through the ritual, particularly in her choice not to stop when the coin cracks. The characterization is strong, though a few moments of overly diagnostic interiority ("the kintsugi of spirit made manifest") slightly blunt the otherwise embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The collector is a compelling archetype with a clear motivation. However, her interiority sometimes resorts to thematic summary rather than embodied experience, as with the explanation of "modest fearlessness." The lack of a moment of genuine doubt or struggle makes her actions feel more procedural than hard-won, limiting the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation and internal state are rendered with exceptional clarity and specificity. The trauma is embodied, not just stated, shown through proprioceptive certainty and calibrated flinches. The final shift from bracing against pain to inhabiting a space of mercy is earned through the story's internal logic, making the character's transformation credible. A minor hesitation arises from the highly articulate, philosophical interiority during a crisis, but it remains consistent with a character forced to intellectualize suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s character is rendered with exceptional depth and consistency. Motivation is not merely stated but viscerally embodied, from the memory in their bare soles to the final acceptance of a new commission. The micro-choice to pay for the lens with a specific, painful memory—"the scent of my grandmother’s apron"—is a masterful moment of characterization, revealing a hierarchy of values where personal grief is sacrificed for communal healing. This act grounds the fantastical premise in profound emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a specific worldview ("every ghost is a story refusing to be buried"). His actions are driven by this professional-yet-personal ethos, and his competence is well-balanced with his sensitivity. The final acceptance of his role as witness is earned, but the moment of self-analysis—"not guilt, not grief, but responsibility"—borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the embodied experience of that burden.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The operator's motivation is exceptionally clear and philosophically grounded, driving every action from interpreting the frost to the final rupture. While initially presented as a cryptic archetype, the brief, powerful reveal of her personal stake—seizing the memory of her mother's smile—grounds the abstract goal in potent, embodied emotion. This detail makes her final, satisfied smile feel entirely earned, fulfilling the 9+ test of a choice earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The revolutionary’s internal conflict between past violence and present aestheticism is embodied in his actions, from tracing the shard to writing haikus. The transformation from mourning a failed past to translating a possible future is earned, particularly through the validation offered by Voss, which feels like a genuine crucible moment rather than a simple epiphany. The final emotional state of purpose is a potent form of Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The repairman’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent internal conflict between his profound skill and his single, haunting moral failure. The motivation for redemption is made tangible and urgent by the stone’s reaction. The final shift in his purpose is earned, though the last few sentences summarizing his new role are slightly too declarative, moving from embodied realization to a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative with purpose. Her interiority is revealed through concrete sensory details and decisive micro-choices, such as tasting the lagoon water. The final choice to stay is a powerful renunciation, fully earned by the preceding accumulation of sensory evidence and the psychometric revelations, fulfilling the contradiction of being "sensibly eccentric" with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized through her actions. The internal conflict regarding the commercialization of her art is established and provides a satisfying engine for her epiphany. Her final choice to leave the sculpture and become a teacher feels earned by the events under the archway, representing a credible change with a felt, on-page cost (renouncing her prior path).

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The artist's motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal transformation feels earned. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular language ("felt in her marrow," "quiet thunder of understanding"). However, the final resolution lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in-scene; her path from "haunted" to "surrendered" is emotionally linear. The final summary, "everything makes sense," slightly undercuts the preceding journey by stating the conclusion rather than letting the final image embody it completely.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving her from academic preservation to embodied witnessing. Her final transformation is earned and carries a palpable cost. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses in-scene; she functions more as a perfect, solemn vessel for the theme rather than a deeply flawed individual, which keeps the score just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and his core internal conflict—rejecting nostalgic restoration in favor of difficult reinvention—is established early and drives the narrative. The climactic choice to give the bottle to the child is a potent, earned expression of his values, demonstrating a shift from solitary control to communal enabling. While bordering on an archetype, the character’s philosophical consistency is a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and its transformation from passive preservation to active awakening is the story's powerful engine. The shift is earned through a specific, personal revelation. The characterization is held back from a perfect score only by the lack of demonstrated internal conflict; she accepts her new, world-altering purpose with a smoothness that slightly lessens the weight of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is rendered with specificity, particularly the excellent phrase “furiously tranquil.” This contradictory state provides a strong anchor for her actions. The arc from trembling awe to purposeful action and finally to “wild serenity” is earned. The story is tightly focused on her, so her interiority drives everything effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized through her meticulous actions. Her character is archetypal—the patient artisan who trusts process over force—which serves the story's fable-like tone perfectly. However, her complete lack of internal contradiction or flaw, while fitting the story's mood, makes her slightly less complex, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a well-defined backstory that justifies his present actions. His interiority is specific and his philosophy of empathic observation is demonstrated, not just stated. The final choice—to return to sweeping—is a powerful act of renunciation that perfectly captures the character's earned peace, satisfying the criteria for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, achieving an archetypal weight without sacrificing specificity. Her motivation, rooted in the "tangled covenant," is consistently embodied through action—her "mute eloquence" is not just a label but a demonstrated mode of being. The final choice to bow her head is a masterful instance of renunciation, a micro-choice that confirms her entire existence and provides a powerful, earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vey’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict is embodied through the “timeless” heartbeat, a powerful and concrete representation of their unmoored state. The final change to a curator of echoes is a satisfying and earned transformation, directly resulting from the story's climax and paying off the initial character setup with a visible cost (the past isolation) and reward (a steady heartbeat).

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira's motivation is clear and consistently dramatized, but her characterization lacks internal contradiction in the moment of crisis. Her philosophy is presented as fully formed and flawlessly executed, which slightly flattens her arc. The phrasing "She calls this practice woven dawns" feels more like an authorial label than organic interiority, a minor but noticeable slip into diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from the macro-level remodeling to the micro-choice of patiently freeing the sparrow. His interiority is concrete, particularly his philosophy of collaboration with nature. The characterization is slightly weakened by the on-the-nose thematic statement in his diary ("Respect isn’t earned by dominance..."), which feels more like an authorial summary than a private reflection, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The "luminous skeptic" is a compelling, specific archetype whose internal conflict—the tension between her empirical methodology and her intuitive pilgrimage—drives the entire narrative. Her motivation is clear and nuanced, and the final shift from observer to participant ("She had become part of the reaction") feels earned and profound, representing a believable transformation with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coachman is a compelling, archetypal figure whose motivation is crystal clear and rooted in his actions. His interiority is conveyed through potent physical details like his "cracked like droughted earth" hands and the "hollow behind his ribs." The one minor dip into explicit summary—"His motivation was neither vengeance nor absolution, but restoration"—is a slight flaw in an otherwise masterfully rendered characterization that relies on showing. His final choices are fully earned by the preceding ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bracken’s motivation is powerfully established and undergoes a meaningful, earned transformation from passive memory-keeper to active community archivist. The initial grief is well-embodied in his attachment to the leaf. The shift is catalyzed by a direct, personal stake—hearing his handler's voice—which compellingly broadens his purpose. The characterization is strong, though it verges on the hagiographic in the final act, lacking the contradictory impulses that define the highest echelon of character work.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the "blessed pariah" paradox. Her internal conflict—between the world's need for anchors and her own nature as a "current"—is dramatized through her choice to stay and sketch. The backstory of her family customs provides a rich, believable foundation for her present actions, making her final stance feel earned rather than declared. Her emotional progression from confusion to quiet recognition is embodied and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elric’s motivation is archetypal yet compellingly rendered through his actions. The concept of a "sacredly playful urge" is consistently embodied, particularly in the climactic act of "amending" rather than conquering. While the characterization lacks deep internal contradiction in the moment of action—he is resolute—his quiet reverence and "cautious abandon" provide a textured interiority that feels earned and aligned with the story's mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with lyrical precision and remains the unwavering engine of the narrative. The arc from "crisis actor" to the authentic, unbowing historian who forces a sovereign to be "truly seen" is powerful and earned. The final choice not to bow is a perfect culmination of the character's internal journey, demonstrating a change with a clear and visible cost to the established order.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The seer's motivation—seeking "the shape of home, a geometry of belonging"—is established with poetic precision and provides a powerful internal drive. The final change from a being who translates the world for others to one who belongs to it herself is deeply earned, culminating in the poignant physical act of sinking to her knees "not in worship, but in arrival." The internal conflict between her painful, sharp memory and her deep-seated longing is beautifully embodied throughout the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation for self-forgiveness is established with immediate clarity and deepened through her actions. Her identity as a chess tutor is not a mere label but the source of the story’s central metaphors—gambits, patterns, consequence—which shapes her perception and approach to the conflict. The final change, moving from "fidgeting productively" to "walking, steady," provides a powerful, embodied resolution earned through the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The artist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, a "devotion to complexity" that drives every action from the session with the child to her final self-confrontation. Her interiority is concrete, especially in the dream of "glass birds nesting in rib cages," which crystallizes her understanding of truth's fragility. The final choice to offer her own fractured regrets is a perfectly earned culmination of her established character, foreclosing the path of simple parables with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with motivation and interiority grounded in specific, embodied action. The protagonist’s internal conflict is made tangible through the ritual. The final choice to use tears as the last measure of lacquer is a powerful, earned culmination. A slight deduction is for moments of over-articulated interiority, like stating her hands shook "from the weight of kintsugi intentions," which borders on diagnostic summary rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.5)
    Motivation is crystalline, rooted in the promise to herself, and this drives every action. The character’s internal conflict between clinging to the past (the seashell) and needing to move forward is dramatized through her choices, culminating in an earned renunciation with the visible cost of leaving the shell behind.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established (“carved into her ribs like a vow”) and her actions are consistent with it. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the climactic moment where her intention is described as “raw and trembling.” The characterization is very strong, avoiding cliché and earning its emotional resolution. It stops just short of the highest tier due to a lack of significant internal contradiction; she is deeply committed and never seems to truly doubt her path, which slightly lessens the tension of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The navigator's motivation is not just stated but embodied through ritualistic action and physiological connection to her environment (the moon phases). Her interiority is specific and poetic, avoiding cliché; her internal conflict is a quiet but powerful struggle to impose a new order on chaos. The final act of singing into the wind is an earned expression of her established character, a choice that feels both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's core contradiction—rationality versus involuntary truthfulness in a world that fears truth—is expertly established and dramatized. Her motivation to cultivate psychological safety is not just stated but embodied in her every action, culminating in the earned, resonant choice to leave the glass eye. The final emotional shift, where "laughter no longer triggered a sob," is a masterful, concrete demonstration of change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the entire narrative. His internal philosophy of "borrowed memories" feels particular and lived-in, not just a label. The final act of renunciation—choosing not to report his findings—is a powerful culmination of his established character as a "keeper of lights and losses," perfectly earned by the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is rooted in a deeply felt backstory that is revealed with perfect timing to charge his final decision. His core trait—being “empirically intuitive”—is not just stated but demonstrated through the pivotal choice to follow the ants, making his actions feel both surprising and inevitable. The fusion of intellectual rigor and instinct creates a memorable, non-stock protagonist whose final choice is an earned culmination of a lifetime of longing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The queen’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-established. Her arc from disenchanted ruler to humbled "witness" feels earned by the climactic confrontation with her past. The only slight weakness is the dialogue of the hooded figure, which verges on articulating the queen's internal state too directly ("You chose power over pulse"), slightly reducing the subtext of her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's conceptual core. The alchemist's motivation is not just stated but dramatized through her reaction to Elias's confession—a choice entirely compelled by her established philosophy. Her internal conflict is palpable, resolved not through simple forgiveness but a complex, fierce act of re-framing, perfectly embodied in the line "she smiled, not gently, but fiercely." This choice creates a powerful and earned character arc within a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict is powerfully dramatized, not just summarized. The shift from jealousy of past selves to using that jealousy as fuel ("it sharpens my focus like a blade on stone") is a compelling and earned micro-choice. The character’s final stance—braiding the threads of chaos—is a credible transformation earned through the preceding internal struggle, with the cost being the abandonment of a belief in "clean endings."

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s internal conflict—feeling like a fraud while seeking meaning—is rendered with concrete emotional detail, not just labels. Her transformation is earned through her interaction with Ren and her re-evaluation of the midwife's screw. Ren, while archetypal, is grounded by specific actions, and his dialogue provides the precise pressure needed to catalyze Elara's change. The final micro-choices feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with clear motivation and beautifully embodied emotion. Elira’s internal conflict between scholarly training and intuitive superstition is dramatized effectively through her choice to hum the lullaby. The final paragraph's realization that "stories... alchemize" pain feels slightly too articulate and diagnostic for the moment, pulling back from an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is stellar, particularly in the contrast between the protagonist’s confident, metaphorical public persona and her vulnerable, direct actions in the scene. The final exchange ("In metaphors?" "In truth.") provides a powerful, earned moment of change. Elias's transformation from silent resentment to fragile openness is credible and affecting, driven by specific, sensory triggers.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist is more of a consistent, archetypal force than a character defined by internal conflict, which is a valid but limiting choice. Her motivation for "clarity" is well-established and compellingly grounded by the wry observation that she calls it "housekeeping." While her final transformation is profound, the lack of demonstrated struggle or contradictory impulses prior to the climax makes the character feel more like a perfect vessel for the plot rather than a participant grappling with its costs until the final moments of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shepherd's motivation is crystalline and his interiority is specific and lyrical, particularly in his perception of time as "the erosion of moments." However, the character reads as a vessel for a single, powerful idea rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. While his dedication is compelling, the absence of a tangible internal struggle or a competing want keeps the characterization from achieving the highest level of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear motivation rooted in a concrete backstory. Aris's internal conflict and ultimate shift in understanding are earned and compelling. The score is slightly tempered by moments of interiority that border on thematic summary, such as "Letting go, she had learned, was not surrender. It was alignment," which feels a touch too articulate for a mind in process.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story’s conceptual framework. Elara’s internal conflict—between her inherited dispositions toward chaos (gambler father) and order (professor mother)—is dramatized through specific choices, from flunking calculus to leaving her own cryptic messages. The final, quiet exchange with her father, mediated by the note and the clover, provides a powerful, earned moment of change without overwrought sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is archetypal but powerful and internally consistent. The operator's motivation is established clearly and her actions align perfectly with it. The final choice to apply her method to herself is an excellent dramatization of internal conflict, where the detached curator must confront her own solitude, providing an earned change with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist’s motivation is sacred and clear, and her interiority is rich with specific, embodied details like choosing not to weep to protect the ink. However, the perfectly articulated, almost declarative nature of the covenant's clauses ("We will startle joy...") feels slightly too composed for an in-the-moment transcription, pulling back from pure embodiment into a more authorial register.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict—pragmatism versus a belief in symbols, performed jocularity versus a deep empathy—is dramatized effectively. The final choice to share her own lonely memory is a perfectly earned culmination of her arc, demonstrating change with a visible cost (vulnerability).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is exceptional, with a motivation that is both unique and deeply felt. Her interiority is rendered through a specific, embodied sensory experience that avoids cliché. The final transformation from an absorber of language to a composer of song is an earned change, sealed by the meaningful renunciation of her ring, representing a clear and poignant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is exceptionally well-realized and consistent. Her defining trait, "confidently uncertain," is not merely stated but dramatized through her core choice to invite edits rather than control them. The internal conflict between regret and acceptance is palpable, and the final shift to embracing "better questions" over answers feels earned, providing a subtle but meaningful character arc with a clear felt cost—the surrender of control.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is potent and conceptually driven. Elara's motivation to "translate silence" is established with concrete action, making her esoteric goal feel grounded. The "joyful sorrow" is beautifully embodied, not just stated, culminating in the choice to teach rather than simply perform. Silas is a well-executed archetype, though his final lines veer close to summarizing the theme, which slightly undermines the otherwise perfect show-don't-tell approach.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her core trait of being "analytically intuitive" reads more as a given power than a practiced skill under pressure. Her backstory as a "lending library arsonist" provides a compelling frame but feels disconnected from the more mystical, destined actions on the page. The characterization is strong and focused, yet lacks a deep internal conflict; her journey is one of discovery and fulfillment rather than a struggle against contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation evolves organically from desperate habit ("drumming softly on her own shins") to a purposeful act of creation. Her internal conflict is beautifully embodied, not stated, through the sensory details of carrying twenty-seven souls. The final transformation into "the weaver" is earned by the preceding struggle, making her newfound wholeness feel profound and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena's characterization is strong, consistent, and drives the entire narrative. Her motivation, rooted in a philosophy of quiet observation, is established early and pays off in a final choice that feels inevitable and earned. The only minor weakness is that her internal conflict is not deeply dramatized; she operates with a quiet certainty that is tested but never truly doubted, making her highly competent but slightly less complex.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The guardian is a compelling archetype whose motivation is both clearly established and poetically potent, particularly the backstory of the boy from Bridge Seven. Her actions align perfectly with her stated purpose, and the internal contradiction—a quiet, gentle soul performing a grim, lonely duty—is dramatized effectively without words. The characterization is deeply integrated into the story's mythic tone, earning its high score through action and resonant purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira’s motivation as a "gardener of second chances" is exceptionally clear and consistent, and her interiority is rendered in vivid, character-particular language. The lack of significant internal conflict or contradiction, while fitting for a character of such conviction, slightly tempers the emotional complexity. Her final self-conceptualization as "just the soil" provides an earned and poignant character resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation and internal conflict are well-defined and compelling. The transformation from a guarded worker to a healer is earned through the story's central mystical experience. However, the otherwise excellent characterization is slightly weakened by a moment of diagnostic self-awareness in a peak beat: "What remained was clarity: she was not meant to mend nets but to mend souls..." This summary flattens the earned epiphany into a label, telling us what the subsequent actions already show more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist's internal contradiction—performing grief while feeling an emotional void, yet driven by a deep, unstated loss—is dramatized through their actions, not just stated. The choice to lie to the officers using their own jargon ("cultivating lightness in grief") reveals a sharp, survivalist intelligence. The final earned stasis, where the character returns to their ritual "lighter, emptier," is a powerful and credible outcome, showing profound endurance at a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s motivation is clear, potent, and consistent, culminating in a change that feels earned within the story's lyric framework. The interiority is specific and embodied, successfully avoiding cliché. A minor deduction is for a single moment of over-articulated insight ("the knowing that uncertainty, too, can be sacred"), which reads more like a thematic summary than a raw, in-the-moment realization, slightly breaking the otherwise seamless embodiment of her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's core concept. Elias's motivation is established through his unique sensory perception rather than exposition, a sophisticated choice. Marta's transformation from amused skeptic to dedicated student is earned and efficient. The "innocently cunning" trait is perfectly dramatized in the initial barter and then brilliantly reprised in Marta's final grin, showing her full adoption of Elias's worldview. Both characters exhibit a coherent internal logic and their relationship evolves with palpable pressure and shared discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is crystalline and drives every action. The characterization succeeds by embodying the story’s central inquiry rather than through complex internal contradiction. Her final emotional release is earned and feels authentic, providing a strong anchor for the story’s thematic resolution. While she functions partly as a thematic vessel, her reverence for her craft makes her compelling and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The protagonist’s motivation—"to teach withering to bloom again"—is not just stated but embodied in every quiet, deliberate action. The internal conflict between her own stasis and her generative acts for others is powerfully conveyed. The story masterfully earns its final moment of subtle change, a shift from suspended grief to validated purpose, making the character’s endurance feel both costly and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, realized through her methodical actions. Interiority is concrete and specific to her intellectual pursuit. The character functions as a perfect lens for the story's concept, though she lacks a significant internal contradiction or flaw that is tested in-scene, which narrowly holds the score back from the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation rooted in a powerful, specific backstory that feels earned. The historian’s internal conflict—the pull of “anguished joy”—is embodied in her every action, culminating in a final choice that is both a rebellion and a reclamation. The character’s contradictory impulses are dramatized in the climax, fulfilling the highest standards of this category.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elira’s motivation is clear, potent, and dramatized through her shift from passive observer to active agent. Her interiority is rendered with lyrical precision, and the final choice to embed the stone is a powerful, earned action rooted in her core values. The cost—reintroducing pain into a world of comfort—is felt, demonstrating a character arc that is both credible and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—self-respect vs. compassion—is well-dramatized through her core dilemma. The choice to reconstruct the tail serves as a potent physical expression of her internal process. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language (e.g., "performative righteousness"), which feels more like an author's analysis than a character's embodied thought in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is powerfully clear and her final transformation is earned. The internal journey from seeking closure to accepting continuation is compelling. However, the initial self-definition ("She wasn’t broken; she was a closure seeker...") verges on a diagnostic label that tells the theme rather than fully embodying the contradiction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a specific, embodied interiority rooted in a clear motivation. The protagonist’s connection to her own unsent letters provides a powerful, particularizing backstory that justifies her actions and empathy. The final choice to release the letters, in contrast to her own hoarding, represents a meaningful and earned change. A minor deduction for the shift into a slightly more diagnostic voice in the final paragraphs, which slightly abstracts her otherwise concrete perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is both deeply felt and consistently expressed through action and interiority. The internal conflict between her empathetic burden ("a cathedral of unfinished hymns") and her desire for reprieve is palpable. Her final action is not one of triumph but of exhausted, tearful release, which feels emotionally authentic and earned. The character reads as a cohesive, singular vision.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is subtle yet powerful, defined by negation ("no dreams") and purpose. The motivation is clear and consistent, driving the central action without needing extensive backstory. The final emotional shift is perfectly calibrated for this character—not a smile, but a physical release of tension ("shoulders softened"), which is an earned and embodied change that respects his engineered nature.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.4)
    The philosopher’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently dramatized. His interiority is rendered with concrete, unique sensory details, avoiding abstraction. The final choice to step into the void feels inevitable, earned by the preceding internal work of “unraveling,” which elegantly re-frames a potential threat as the ultimate goal. The character arc from "stray" to "pioneer" is fully realized with a palpable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The characterization of the guides as a collective is archetypally strong and consistent with the story's fabulist tone. Their motivations are clear and their actions, like Torvin listening to the tree, are specific and resonant. However, the dialogue at the climax ("Courage doesn't rust...") veers into direct thematic summary, momentarily flattening the characters into mouthpieces and reducing the subtext that had been built so carefully.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The bellhop’s motivation, rooted in trauma and a flawed conception of safety, is both clear and poignantly complex. His internal conflict is expertly externalized through his relationship with the piano and the staircase stain. The final choice feels inevitable yet hard-won, a perfect culmination of his arc where his contradictory impulses (to protect vs. to permit life) are resolved with a tangible, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The titan’s motivation is powerfully established and her final renunciation of the throne is a credible, earned choice that aligns with her established character. Her interiority is concrete, especially the "hollow echo of justice." The characterization is very strong, lacking only a moment where a contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene rather than summarized, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation—the "quiet, gnawing need to discover why some paths disappear"—is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative with quiet force. Her internal state is masterfully externalized through the tapping ritual, a tic that becomes the story's central mechanism. The character’s arc from a witness of loss to a teacher of a new form of listening is earned and resonant, fulfilling the 9+ quick test for a costly, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and her internal state—"hollow," "unmoored"—is well-established and embodied. The arc from passive stargazer to active catalyst is earned through on-page action. The characterization is strong, but a final, fully realized internal contradiction at the moment of choice is slightly understated, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    The grandmother's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in a specific philosophy of tradition that drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is conveyed through potent, lyrical language ("weaving resistance into ritual," "remembers what soil remembers"). The final choice to offer, not impose, destiny is a powerful culmination of her character, though the absence of any significant flaw or mistake makes her feel more archetypal than fully human.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is rendered with exceptional, concrete detail, avoiding diagnostic labels in the pivotal moments. The motivation is clear, and the internal conflict between holding trauma as a static relic versus a living memory is beautifully dramatized. The final change, symbolized by the photo becoming a "compass," is earned by the preceding "freeze," a micro-choice to surrender to the moment that feels both inevitable and revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character’s arc from “crestfallen” to “crestRISEN” is earned through on-page action and a clear, compelling motivation. Her interiority is vividly rendered through rhetorical questions that evolve from expressions of despair to tools of inquiry. The final shift is not just declared but embodied in the act of painting on her eyelids, a perfect synthesis of her artistic past and her transformed present.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The tracker's motivation is singular and potent ("needed to know why"), driving every action. Her interiority is conveyed with specific, contradictory phrases like "serene anger" and "molten fury," avoiding cliché. The final choice to disappear is a profound change, yet it feels entirely earned by the preceding revelation, a logical and emotional culmination of her obsessive quest.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong. The archivist’s internal state, the "bravely conflicted storm," is established effectively and resolves into a state of "Earned Stasis" by the end. Her motivation is clear and consistent. The transition from trembling fingers to calm acceptance is a well-executed micro-arc, fulfilling her purpose at the cost of her freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s characterization is powerful and consistent, realized through resonant action rather than exposition. Her core internal conflict—the bounty hunter’s legacy versus her cultivated pacifism—is masterfully embodied in the recurring ritual of sheathing the knife. The final interaction with the child solidifies her stance not as a naive idealist, but as someone who has made a costly, deliberate choice to endure and create, making her renunciation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is established through highly specific, competent action rather than exposition. The fisher's defining trait, "cool-headed," is consistently demonstrated under pressure, particularly when she matches the feral pitch without flinching. Her motivation is clear and her unique skill set is integral to the plot, making her feel like a necessary and singular figure in this world.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from her meticulous observation to her decisive intervention. Her interiority is sharp and specific, avoiding cliché. The characterization is held back from perfection only by a slight lack of on-page internal contradiction; her resolve is so complete that it borders on archetypal, missing a deeper dramatization of the struggle implied by the "orbits of regret."

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation—to resolve her own guilt by healing the machine's—is clear and compelling. Her interiority is beautifully embodied through her craft, and her actions, particularly the final ritual, are a direct and earned consequence of her established skills and past failures. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice of healing over destruction that feels both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and her internal journey is rendered with concrete, specific emotion. The arc from needing to "remember how silence could hold intention" to recognizing that "the mess wasn't chaos to be solved" is well-earned. A minor point of friction is the externalized wisdom from the sand-voice ("You think silence is empty?"), which slightly lessens the impact of her own internal discovery, feeling more like a given lesson than a purely emergent one.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira's characterization as a "gentle radical" is powerfully realized through her actions, particularly the central contradiction of prying loose a stone shard while seeking to heal. Her motivation is clear and compelling. The transformation from being "dragged down" by the past to having it "walk beside her" is earned and impactful. The only slight weakness is that her "retrocognitively trapped" state is more of a declared condition than a consistently embodied constraint influencing her moment-to-moment perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The ghost’s motivation to find an encore is clear and poignant, but her internal world, rendered through synesthesia, gives her a truly unique and compelling interiority. The final choice to become an "invitation" rather than seek an ovation is a powerful, earned change, showing a clear arc from self-focused memory to selfless inspiration with a visible cost (her dissolution).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elira's "affectionate skeptic" nature is dramatized, not stated, through her simultaneous fear that the voices are real and her methodical, brilliant effort to map them. Her motivation is deeply felt and her final choice to open the studio is an earned evolution from victim to guide, showing a clear and credible change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and existential, driving every action. The shift from a solitary observer to an active participant is earned through the story's climax, and the cost of this transformation is made tangible. Interiority is rendered through a unique sensory palette, avoiding cliché and grounding her abstract purpose in concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is a consistent and compelling archetype, but functions more as a vessel for the story's theme than a character with deep interiority. While her actions are purposeful, the lack of embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier; she is defined by her quiet inspiration, not a struggle with it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira's character is powerfully rendered through embodied pain and determined action, making her final renunciation feel earned. Her motivation is clear and consistent. However, a few lines of interiority veer close to self-diagnosis, such as the explicit declaration, "Her motivation had never been revenge, nor absolution—it was to fix what’s broken," which summarizes her core conflict rather than letting the contradiction play out entirely in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman's characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority deeply rooted in his sensory experience and past losses. His core contradiction—rejecting control for attunement—is dramatized consistently. The final choice to offer the needle is perfectly earned by his established philosophy. The passenger is necessarily sparse but her shift from grief to resolve is rendered legibly through the coachman's perception, making their silent exchange powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The potter's motivation is clear, quiet, and consistently enacted. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through a lyrical, observant voice that aligns with her "zen-minded" nature. The culminating choice to create and leave the unfired pot is a perfect expression of her earned understanding. The characterization is held back from the highest tier only by a lack of sharp internal conflict; she reads more as a serene conduit for the story's theme than a person wrestling with contradictory impulses to arrive at her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and her internal shift from "wistfully pragmatic" to "quiet certainty" is earned through the story's central action. Her interiority is concrete and compelling. The score is capped just below the 9-band due to a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("Protected vulnerability—that was the tone of this hour...") which slightly abstracts her emotional state rather than fully embodying it in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.5)
    Veyra's characterization is exceptional, with motivation and internal conflict deeply integrated into the story’s core mechanics. Her transition from a curator of loss, burdened by memory, to a midwife of possibility is earned through the climax. The concept of "atomically reflective skin" is brilliantly used not as ornament, but as a mechanism for both memory and action, culminating in the embodied choice to channel her own resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation—the ache of being "untethered"—is established early and provides a clear, compelling engine for the narrative. His transformation is not an unearned epiphany but a decisive choice rooted in his established character as a whimsical keeper of secrets. The final change is earned by his ritualistic actions, and the cost—the dissolution of his individual self—is made tangible on the page, fulfilling the 9+ test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is powerfully established through her past experience and present resolve, creating a character whose competence feels earned, not just stated. Her internal state is conveyed through concrete action and embodied perception, particularly the way she processes the world through signals. The transition from passive academic to active guardian is clear and compelling, though her internal struggle during the climax itself is minimal, presenting her as almost too unflappably prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s defining internal conflict—claustrophobia versus mission—is well-embodied and tested effectively in the narrow passage. However, the climactic transformation relies on a sudden, received epiphany rather than a difficult choice made under pressure. The cost of her change feels low, as she simply discards a tool and a misconception in exchange for a complete cure and cosmic insight, which slightly undermines the struggle that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional; her motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is a compelling and unique driver that justifies the story's unconventional resolution. Her face blindness is seamlessly integrated as both a limitation and a unique strength, shaping her worldview and methodology. The killer's motivation is also intriguing, though his shift from silent observer to weeping confessor feels slightly accelerated, and the dialogue, while functional, lacks the deep texture of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully rendered and consistent, directly fueling the climax. Her interiority is specific, particularly the shift from intellectual pursuit to familial legacy. The primary weakness is the repeated descriptor "nervously confident," which functions as a label rather than an embodied internal conflict; her actions and thoughts read as almost entirely certain and awestruck, missing the palpable tension of nervousness.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is masterful, with a compelling internal motivation to “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’.” The fiddler’s transformation is earned through the central action of playing music, and his interiority is rendered in concrete, poetic detail. The final emotional state—a quiet acceptance of a fragmented new beginning—is potent and believable, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is vivid and driven by a compelling internal contradiction. The protagonist's motivations are clear, and his final transformation is earned. However, the interiority occasionally verges on being overly articulate and diagnostic, particularly in moments of reflection like "not failure, but physics," which can slightly flatten the embodied feel of his crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chronicler’s motivation for "quiet redemption" is established effectively and pays off in her final choice to accept and redistribute sorrow. The character’s arc from observer to active participant is earned and compelling. While her internal state is clear, the story lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in a scene; her journey is more of a serene, linear deepening of understanding rather than a visceral struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, establishing the druid's guarded nature as a core internal conflict. The transformation from a "fortress of moss and marrow" to "revealed" is earned through the crucible of the vortex. The brief backstory block is effective, anchoring her resistance in past trauma without losing momentum. The final state of "warlike serenity" is a powerful and precise encapsulation of her new self, showing a change with felt cost—the loss of her protective armor.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The visionary's motivation is crystalline and her actions are perfectly aligned with her purpose. Her interiority is conveyed through potent, specific details like her "precise hunger" and the reverence she shows the clipping. While her competence is well-established, the lack of a visible internal struggle or a moment of doubt within the scene itself keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier; she is an icon of purpose more than a person grappling with it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and focused. Elira's philosophy is well-embodied in her actions, and Kael serves as an effective, ideologically coherent foil. The dialogue, while potent, sometimes borders on articulating the theme too directly, as in "I weave them like lullabies," which slightly reduces subtext in favor of declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.5)
    Jasper’s characterization is exceptional, with a core internal contradiction—the desire for factual insulation versus a buried artistic longing—dramatized through concrete action. The shift from measuring the cloth to listening to it is an earned, embodied change, not a declared epiphany. The reprisal of "confidently uncertain" moving from a past criticism to a future strength is a masterful touch that demonstrates a fully realized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to understand transition is expertly tied to her professional background and her personal history of intellectual fear ("buried three dissertations...by the terror of nearing truth"). This internal conflict gives her methodical patience a compelling backstory. Her key choices—inventing a cuneiform sign for "forgiveness" and offering an "invitation" not a "command"—are perfectly aligned with her established nature and drive the resolution with profound elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The librarian’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear, potent internal contradiction: the duty to preserve wonder versus the personal erosion caused by her fluctuating identity. Her motivation is established early and tested through the central action of "smelting." The choice to accept contradiction is an earned moment of internal resolution, showing a complex hierarchy of values where preserving memory requires sacrificing personal certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inspector’s motivation is clear, potent, and drives every action. Her interiority is revealed through specific, vulnerable confessions—particularly envying the dead—that provide a compelling internal conflict between her profound hope for humanity and her personal despair. The final transformation is earned by this demonstrable surrender, making the cost of becoming a conduit feel both significant and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority rendered through concrete, specific actions and perceptions. The protagonist's creed, "daringly methodical," is not merely stated but dramatized in her ritual of mapping and measuring. The final earned shift toward self-forgiveness is rooted in a believable internal contradiction, satisfying the high-band criteria for a complex emotional progression without resorting to diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb. The protagonist's motivation is established early and her internal state of "cautious exuberance" provides a compelling contradiction that fuels the narrative. Her actions, particularly the self-scarring documentation, are concrete embodiments of her commitment. The final shift from seeker to archive is an earned transformation, a powerful resolution of her quest that feels inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elira’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict is made concrete through her interaction with the story’s core elements—the violin, the plants, the coffee. Her final series of choices feels both surprising and inevitable, a hallmark of excellent characterization. The Chancellor’s on-page transformation, while brief, serves as a perfect crucible to reflect the change Elira has wrought.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is sacred and unwavering, which fits the story's reverent tone. Her interiority is conveyed through poetic, embodied action ("fingers stilled," "hands trembling not with grief but reverence"). The final paragraph provides a powerful character closure, recasting her life's work as the path to her own chosen end, which feels earned and profound. The characterization is exceptional, lacking only a moment of internal contradiction or hesitation to achieve a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict as a healer seeking her own peace is well-realized. The final choice feels earned by the preceding reflection. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated self-awareness, such as "The kindly decisive part of her...nodded once," which labels a trait rather than purely dramatizing it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character’s internal conflict between polished artifice and authentic vulnerability is compelling and earned. The motivation is clear and the final change is credible. The line "Protected vulnerability—that’s what this felt like" is a minor slip into diagnostic label-speak that slightly flattens an otherwise embodied moment, preventing a score in the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional, her paradoxical motivation and embodied grief providing a powerful engine for the scene. Her backstory of professional rejection and personal loss perfectly justifies her indirect, patient methodology (“truth must be woven—not declared”). Kael's arc from confusion to revelation is concise but credible. The only minor reservation is the line "her joints creaking with the paradox of youth trapped in old bones," which feels slightly more stated than the rest of the story’s elegantly shown embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is archetypal yet potent, realized through a singular, unwavering motivation. The skimmer’s internal state of "weathered resolve" is not merely stated but embodied in its profound stillness. The renunciation of motion, framed against the memory of those who failed by pursuing it, serves as a powerful internal conflict that is resolved through an act of Earned Stasis, making the final commitment to waiting feel both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s motivation and internal conflict are well-established and compelling, and his final change feels earned. However, the dialogue with the light figure verges on making the entity a thematic mouthpiece rather than a character, slightly flattening the crucial climactic interaction. Lior's arc from chasing grandeur to finding grace is strong, but the revelation is delivered to him rather than fully synthesized from within.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative with a quiet intensity. The shift from “searching” to “signifying” represents a credible, earned change, grounded in the climax. His interiority is conveyed through lyrical, particular perceptions rather than generic labels, fulfilling the need for concrete characterization. While internal conflict is more a sustained state of seeking than a moment of contradictory impulses, his focused endurance is a powerful choice in itself.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation to "wavelength align with purpose" is a compelling and specific internal drive, and her primary conflict—surrender versus hope—is embodied in her every action, particularly her reliance on casting lots. The final change from passive surrender to active leadership is earned through the climactic vision, making her choice to lead feel inevitable and powerful. The internal state, especially the "stellar doubt," is rendered with precision and originality.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The reaper’s motivation is rooted in a specific, felt loss, and his internal state is rendered with concrete imagery (“echoes clung to his ribs like frost”). The transformation from “heartbroken” to “heart-carrier” is not just declared but earned through the central, ritualistic action, providing a compelling and coherent arc with a visible cost—the acceptance of his role as a rememberer.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is superb. The "lukewarm mage" is a brilliant, specific concept, and his defining trait—"the tepid aura of someone perpetually unsure if he’d remembered to close the oven"—is a masterclass in concrete interiority. His motivation is clear and consistent, and the final shift from devoted effort to "quiet confirmation" is an earned and satisfying change. The contradiction between his lukewarm nature and his intense, brittle devotion is dramatized through his patient actions, fulfilling the highest standards of character work.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias Vey’s transformation from a bureaucratic functionary to a keeper of memory is both credible and compelling. His initial motivation is clear, and the internal conflict between his mandate and his emergent empathy is dramatized effectively through his interactions with the artifacts. The story earns his final stance; the line, “I was ordered to be precisely humane...And humanity remembers,” is a powerful crystallization of his arc, showing how a contradictory impulse has become his core value with a clear professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core internal conflict between the alchemist's measured, scientific self and her "secretly sentimental" nature is established with concrete details (ratios vs. pressed petals) and drives the entire narrative. Her final change is not an unearned epiphany but a culmination of this conflict, earned through an act of surrender. The final journal entry provides a perfect, character-specific crystallization of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and earned through a concise backstory of failure, creating a powerful internal contradiction between the need for truth and the responsibility for hope. Her final choice to continue her mission is a perfect example of Earned Stasis, where endurance itself is the costly, meaningful act. The character is defined entirely through her meticulous, pressure-tested actions and internal calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his internal contradictions are well-dramatized. The character arc from numb survivor to a being capable of connection is earned through the central choice. The secondary characters are slightly one-dimensional, serving as mouthpieces for the conflict's two poles. A minor deduction is for the slightly cliché beat of "the first true expression to cross his face in years," which feels less specific than the rest of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and serves as the story's engine. Aris's defining trait—being "porous to the strange"—is not merely stated but dramatized in his immediate acceptance of the seed. His motivation is unwavering, and the final revelation of his journal entry provides a powerful, earned insight into his unique value system, framing a lifetime of patience not as a wait for an outcome but as the outcome itself.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is rendered with profound specificity, rooted in the unique backstory of a "leaf blower symphony conductor." His internal conflict—a desperate need for connection versus the stark reality of loss—is embodied in the physical ritual of his conducting. The subtle shift from weeping for a "real" laugh to smiling at a "triumphant" echo demonstrates a powerful, earned moment of resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.6)
    The guardian’s interiority is rendered with exceptional, particular detail; its motivation shifts from a passive, aching vigil to an active, empathetic choice. The contradiction between its feral appearance and its deep longing for connection is beautifully sustained. The final change from exile to emissary is earned by the preceding internal realizations, with the cost being the full acceptance of uncertainty, a path foreclosed on returning to a simple, known home.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character’s motivation is powerful and his internal arc from seeking perfection to embracing process is compelling and earned. The final change feels significant. However, his interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, abstract self-analysis, such as stating "The core concept he clung to was creative destruction," which slightly lessens the dramatic immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and deepens satisfyingly from a specific goal (hush) to a profound purpose (finding beginnings in endings). Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular language, and the final change from seeker to "conductor" is earned by a credible internal shift, not an unearned epiphany. The final smile and quiet departure feel like a complete and earned emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.3)
    The deckhand's characterization is superb, driven by a consistent and compelling motivation that crystallizes perfectly on the page ("every soul aboard deserved a single, solid world"). His internal state of resilient positivity is not merely stated but demonstrated through his whistling and grin, making his later, tireless work feel earned. The quiet, grateful reunion with the captain provides a powerful emotional anchor at the end, showing a relationship defined by shared, unspoken understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.4)
    The architect’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are rigorously consistent with her stated goal. The internal conflict is externalized effectively through the gallery's resistance. The final change to "older, quieter" is earned, but her "unsettling calm" throughout, while a potent stylistic choice, slightly mutes the sense of a desperate internal struggle, keeping this just shy of perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in necessity rather than nostalgia. Her interiority is concrete, especially during the power outage scene. However, the stated trait of being "balancedly curious" is established in backstory rather than dramatized through a difficult on-page choice, making her feel slightly more like a wise mentor archetype than a character with active internal contradictions in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with compelling specificity, rooted in a professional empathy that avoids sentimentality. Her actions are consistent and reveal her character through choice—particularly the pivot from listening to broadcasting. While the girl is slightly archetypal, her grief is well-embodied; her silence and final whisper are more potent than extensive interiority would be at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is established immediately and with poetic specificity: "to stand by the unremembered." Her internal conflict with claustrophobia provides a powerful frame, introduced in the first sentence and resolved in the last, creating a satisfying and earned arc. Interiority is concrete and actions align perfectly with her reverent goal; her touching of the child's drawing is a particularly strong micro-choice that reveals character and advances the plot's magical element. The transformation from being trapped by stone to carrying "open sky within her" is a thematically resonant and fully earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, moving beyond simple survival to a nuanced quest for "wisdom from failure." His interiority is masterfully rendered through concrete actions—counting heartbeats, clutching the shard—that embody his liminal state without resorting to summary. The final choice to press the shard into his palm is a perfect, earned micro-action that crystallizes his acceptance of this painful, grounding reality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established with profound clarity and emotional weight, rooted in the tangible loss of her mother tongue. Her actions are a direct, earned expression of this motive, and her internal state is conveyed through potent, embodied perception rather than summary. The final act of weeping while continuing to speak is a powerful fusion of contradictory impulses, showing the immense personal cost of her success. The character is a flawless execution of a determined, competent archetype driven by a specific, resonant grief.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation to resolve her bitterness is sharp and specific, and her final transformation provides a clear 'after' state. While her internal state is well-established, the on-page experience is more of executing a resolved plan than wrestling with contradictory impulses in the moment. Moira serves as an effective catalyst, her archetypal wisdom providing a firm counterpoint to Elara's tight-throated desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    The violinist's motivation is archetypal yet rendered with concrete purpose through the grandmother's charged instruction and the locust shell. Her emotions are effectively embodied in physical strain ("bow trembling," "arm ached, her fingers blistered"), grounding the fable-like scenario. The character's unwavering focus is a strength for this length, and the final choice to leave for "other silenced places" is earned by the visible cost of her performance, confirming her identity as a recurring force rather than a one-off savior.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The mailman's motivation—"the quiet, desperate hunt for where broken promises heal"—is not just stated but embodied in every action. The central contradiction of being "respectfully rebellious" is dramatized effectively, and his internal state is rendered with poetic precision, culminating in the felt cost of the final scene: "The bottle’s absence left his satchel lighter, but his chest heavier."

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The carpenter's motivation—to interpret silence—is established with poetic clarity and remains the unwavering core of his character. His actions, from following the chimes to beginning his work, are seamlessly aligned with his internal state. The central contradiction of a silent man who "sings" with his hands is beautifully executed, and his final dedication feels like an earned culmination of his entire being rather than a simple plot choice. This is exceptional character work through action and interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The librarian's motivation is crystalline and her actions are consistent, but she reads more as a highly competent functionary of the plot than a character with internal contradictions. Her defining trait, "sanely eccentric," is asserted more than it is dramatized as a choice with trade-offs. The story succeeds through her flawless execution of a plan, lacking a moment of struggle, doubt, or a difficult micro-choice that would reveal a deeper hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The librarian's motivation is singular, potent, and drives every action. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through the metaphor of light-gathering, and her shift from obsessive searching to surrender represents a meaningful internal change. The final piece of dialogue, "Longing is the only map that never lies," verges on a thematic statement, slightly flattening the earned complexity of her character into a concluding aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith is a consistent archetype whose motivation is clear, but he lacks the specific, contradictory interiority of a fully realized character. His primary character-defining moment—tying the crimson ribbon as a promise—is a strong, tangible choice. However, his defining trait of "unassumingly bold" is more asserted than dramatized, as the central opposition is overcome with symbolic ease rather than through a costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is superb and serves as the story's spine. Motivation is established with surgical precision—"not to mourn, but to recover"—and the defining trait, "chronically curious," pays off with devastating inevitability in the final line. The final choice is not just a plot resolution but the ultimate expression of character, an act of Earned Stasis where she embraces her core identity at a profound cost, making it feel both surprising and entirely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.5)
    The archivist’s characterization is superb, realized through concrete action and a powerful internal contradiction. Her "combative tenderness" is not just a label but a demonstrated philosophy, evident in her sharp correction of the novice and her challenging, silent mentorship of the cartographer. The rare, deliberate "one forward step" is a masterful micro-choice, embodying a shift earned through the scene's events, with the cost being her own necessary fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira's motivation is potent and specific: "She simply could not bear a world without that shimmer." Her actions are perfectly aligned with this core desire, creating a character of immense integrity. The interiority is rendered through the concrete memories she weaves, which is an effective method of characterization. The piece just misses the highest tier because her competence is absolute; there is no moment of doubt or contradictory impulse, which would have added another layer of complexity to her otherwise flawless portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation for "balance" is established clearly and her competence is demonstrated through reverent, precise action. Her interiority shines during the moment of hesitation before the difficult knot, revealing a compelling blend of experience and caution. The character arc is subtle but present—a deepening of reverence into ritual—and the final image of her steady shadow carrying "grace" provides a powerful, earned resolution for this specific task, even as her larger work remains unfinished.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation is established as both professional (“methodically curious”) and deeply personal (“visceral,” linked to her grandmother), creating a compelling and consistent interiority. Her final emotional catharsis (“wept, not from sorrow, but from recognition”) is earned by the meticulous intellectual journey preceding it, perfectly satisfying the 9+ test for an earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, and their "quietly analytic" trait is masterfully dramatized as both a tool and a limitation. The internal conflict between intellectual dissection and emotional surrender is palpable, culminating in an earned character change. The imagined voice of Amelia Earhart serves as an effective, if slightly convenient, device for externalizing this conflict. The final change is profound and well-supported by the preceding obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The balladeer’s motivation for belonging is not just stated but embodied in specific, idiosyncratic actions like singing to cracks and using a bolt plate as a cipher key. Her internal state of "driftingly alert sorrow" is powerfully translated into external choices, culminating in an earned and believable shift from seeking personal sanctuary to building a communal one. The final change is a direct result of the story's central interaction, showing a character altered by events with a clear cost paid (her loneliness is confronted and transformed, not erased).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong. The servant's motivation is established with nuance—"summoned—not by decree, but by instinct"—and her internal state is beautifully embodied through action, such as her fingers trembling "not from cold, but recognition." The final change to a perspective of "gratitude, not distortion" is earned through the preceding beats of discovery and reflection. The portrayal of her relationship with the absent mentor is handled with an effective "affectionate detachment" that feels authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, with a clear motivation rooted in specific, embodied grief. The protagonist's internal state is rendered through her unique methodology, avoiding generic emotional summary. The self-diagnosis of "quietly explosive" is a minor slip toward telling, but it is immediately grounded in a concrete image ("stare at an empty chair and feel the air crackle"), redeeming it. The final change—the smile of acceptance—is a powerful micro-choice, earned by the preceding methodical endurance, representing a credible shift in her internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The artist's motivation is established as "simple, irrational, sacred," providing a powerful engine for the narrative. Her core internal conflict—the perceived deficit of her face blindness—is not just a trait but the lens for the entire story, culminating in an earned, embodied epiphany. The final action, to sit and await the end, is a perfect, quiet culmination of her arc, demonstrating a profound change from preservation to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlen’s motivation is singular, clear, and beautifully rendered through his actions. The character’s change from a passive interpreter of the world to an active co-creator is earned and satisfying. His defining trait, “diligently curious,” is dramatized effectively, not just stated, and directly powers the narrative from the inciting incident to the final resonant action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is clear, specific, and evolves from a concrete desire ("uncap the final mystery") to a profound philosophical acceptance. Her past, shown through the mirrors, provides a compelling, embodied justification for her quest without feeling like an info-dump. The final transformation from "locksmith chasing prophecy" to "keeper of quiet mendings" is earned and resonant, showing a credible change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Characterization is effective for its mythic register, with Elira's motivation being clear and potent. Kael and Liora serve as well-drawn proxies for the community's trust, grounding Elira's abstract influence in a concrete emotional exchange. The story smartly defines her power not as command but as "resonance," an earned summary. The lack of deep internal conflict is a valid choice for this fable-like structure, but it keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier, which demands more visible contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a motivation that is both clear and profound, rooted in the core theme of flawed beauty. His sorrow is uniquely embodied in concrete, memorable images like "tears had crystallized long ago into tuning forks." The backstory integration is seamless, anchoring his present actions in a deep past without losing momentum. The character’s internal state is less a conflict and more a settled, sorrowful purpose, which is a valid and powerfully executed choice for this specific narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb, anchored by a motivation that is refreshingly specific and non-heroic. The line "His motivation wasn’t heroism; it was arithmetic" provides a compellingly weary and pragmatic lens for all his actions. His contradictory impulses—resignation to his duty versus the active, precise effort he expends—are dramatized consistently, culminating in a final act of endurance that is both earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.8)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a specific professional mindset (polymer chemist) and using it as both the source of her initial pain and the vessel for her transformation. Her internal conflict between a need for control and the acceptance of chaotic, natural processes is dramatized through concrete actions and perceptions. The late reveal that her daughter was also "symphonically minded" provides a deeply resonant and earned connection that validates the protagonist’s shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vendor's motivation is exceptionally clear and her central contradiction—seeking to unwrite herself by brokering erasure for others—is dramatized effectively through her actions. The final shift to a state of earned endurance is compelling and has a visible cost. While the interiority is consistently voiced, its high level of lyrical self-awareness occasionally reads as more diagnostic than embodied, a minor point in an otherwise powerful character study.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, with a clear and compelling motivation that is dramatized, not just stated. The internal state is rendered through the unique sensory detail of tasting memories. The final earned change is convincing, though the internal conflict in the climax reads more as steadfast resolve than active struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her established traits as an "empathetically decisive" librarian. Her competence is well-dramatized. However, the characterization lacks a layer of internal conflict; she operates as a near-perfect archetypal healer without visible struggle, contradictory impulses, or a moment of doubt, which keeps the portrayal from achieving the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a highly specific and compelling interiority. The "helix-minded" trait is not just a label but is embodied in her perception and method, creating a powerful fusion of scientific and emotional logic. The internal conflict between chaotic grief and precise intellect is dramatized effectively, and her final shift toward potential is earned through the on-page processing of entangled memories. Her motivation is clear and consistent, making her a memorable and distinct protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira is a highly competent and motivated protagonist whose actions logically follow from her established role as an archivist. Her unique "prism-minded" trait is demonstrated rather than merely stated, justifying her ability to solve the grotto's puzzles. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she proceeds through the challenges with almost flawless execution, which limits the story's emotional depth and makes her feel more like a function of the plot than a person shaped by it.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and his internal transformation is earned and palpable, culminating in tears of recognition, not sorrow. His interiority is specific and beautifully rendered. However, a slight deduction is for moments where the narration steps in to label the theme ("Empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture"), which feels like a diagnostic summary of his state rather than a purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The character's motivation and transformation are clear and compelling; the journey from the worry stone as a "totem of anxiety" to a "compass calibrated to inner north" is well-executed. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic summary. Phrases like "Beauty, he realized, wasn’t in flawless victory, but in the struggle..." read more like an authorial thesis statement than a raw, in-the-moment epiphany, slightly flattening the character's voice into the story's theme.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and grounded in the powerful backstory of the war-torn village. Her actions are a direct, embodied expression of her philosophy, particularly the description of her hands as a "blind cartographer." The characterization is weakened slightly by a final paragraph that drifts into diagnostic label-speak ("Empathy wasn’t taught—it was recovered"), stating the theme a bit too plainly rather than letting her final actions carry the full weight of the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from her daily rituals to the climactic embrace of the flower's truth. Her interiority is concrete, expressed through her unique sensory focus. The final choice to replant the husk provides a perfect, earned culmination of her ambition, demonstrating change without needing a dramatic reversal. The characterization is powerful, though it borders on being slightly too archetypal in its wisdom, lacking a contradictory flaw that would create deeper internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established through action. The final shift in her purpose—from active "pilot" to receptive "echo"—is an earned change. However, her characterization verges on being an instrument for the plot; she is the perfect person for the task, which slightly lessens the sense of internal conflict or struggle beyond the immediate physical challenges.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, presenting a protagonist defined by professional rigor and a deeply felt, understated moral drive. Interiority is masterfully handled, blending technical observation with a near-poetic grasp of the story's central threat. The motivation is clear and compelling, and the final shift from investigator to a watchful guardian is an earned, powerful crystallization of his values, symbolized perfectly by the weight of Varga's patch.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bell ringer's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her synesthetic gift and a defined purpose. Interiority is vivid, particularly the embodied synesthetic details like tasting G-minor. However, the character reads more as a perfect, archetypal vessel for the theme rather than a person with tangible flaws or internal contradictions acting in-scene; she is a function of the story’s concept, flawlessly executed, but lacks the friction of a more complex human agent.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, consistent, and compellingly unconventional—seeking understanding over restoration. Her change from a keeper of relics to a keeper of thresholds is earned through on-page action and renunciation. The characterization is strong, showing competence and precision through action rather than assertion. The only minor weakness is that her internal conflict feels resolved before the story begins; we see her execute a plan with precision, not wrestle with the choice itself in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character’s motivation is powerfully established as a "gnawing need to map the unmappable," and her method is consistent. The backstory of losing her name provides a compelling, if brief, anchor for her work. However, her interiority occasionally reads as a vessel for the story's high concept rather than a fully distinct personality with contradictory impulses acting in the present moment; she is what she does, with little friction beyond the stated cost of her empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.4)
    The courier’s internal contradiction between calcified routine and a yearning for wonder is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion. Her key choices—veering from the efficient path, revealing the pendant, and ultimately relinquishing it—are both surprising and inevitable, stemming from a well-established internal conflict. The transformation from relying on an external tool for wonder to becoming a source of it herself is earned with a visible cost, making the final character state resonant and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mystic's motivation is established immediately and remains the story's anchor. Her interiority is specific and her defining trait—"firmly grounded in both science and spirit"—is demonstrated through her actions (recording, measuring) rather than just stated. The final choice to renounce publication in favor of private resonance is a powerful act of earned stasis, providing a credible and costly character resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The spinner's motivation is singular, powerful, and sustained, driving every choice from puzzling out the runes to the final, earned self-sacrifice. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through action rather than summary, particularly the choice to hum instead of weep because "Tears would unravel the weave"—a perfect fusion of character, skill, and stakes. The final choice feels both tragic and inevitable, a testament to a character arc that is concise and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlo’s character is consistent and his motivation is clear, culminating in an earned final choice. The interiority, however, occasionally veers into thematic summary ("meekness was not weakness but a forge waiting for its spark") rather than fully embodied contradiction. While his quiet determination is well-demonstrated through action, a deeper sense of internal struggle would elevate the characterization from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s motivation is compelling and drives every action. The interiority is beautifully rendered through sensory detail, particularly in the opening. The final emotional beat is earned and complex, but the line "some truths don’t set you free—they make you responsible" borders on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly over-articulating the epiphany rather than letting it rest entirely in the embodied feeling of the shard growing cool.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias’s reticence is not merely a trait but an active, grief-shaped worldview demonstrated through his tangible, silent rituals. The internal conflict between solitude and the need for connection is masterfully shown, not told. The final shift, embodied by his humming, is earned through the preceding scene's pressure, making his emotional progression from a contained ache to a "luminescent" beacon feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The herald's motivation is archetypally clear and consistent, serving the mythic tone. However, her characterization operates more as a beautiful, static portrait than a crucible of choice. The story describes her internal state rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the present moment; we are told of her fractured soul, but we don't feel the pieces grind against each other in a difficult decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dye master’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, rooted in the tangible dissonance of a donor heart. Her internal conflict is not just stated but embodied in her actions—tracing the wing, observing the old man, and finally infusing her own tears into the dye. The final shift from replicating magnetism to cultivating her own fractures represents a perfectly earned character change, foreclosing the path of mimicry with the felt cost of self-acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and unique, grounding the fantastical premise in a specific "arboreal" desire. Her transformation from technician to "cartographer of witnessed sorrow" is earned and legible. However, the interiority, while poetic, leans toward summary at the peak epiphany ("She understood now why..."), slightly flattening the internal struggle of accepting such a profound, burdensome revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The keeper’s motivation is powerfully established, and her internal state of scattered memory is a masterful mirror of the realm's crisis. Her transformation from "keeper of fragments" to "the loom" is an earned and resonant character change. The only thing holding it back from a higher score is that the central choice to begin humming feels more like a gentle, inevitable unfolding rather than an action born from sharp, contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira's character arc from shame to self-acceptance is compelling and her motivations are clear. However, the articulation of her final epiphany—phrases like "she saw her sensitivity not as weakness, but as a lens"—veers into diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the emotional climax by telling the reader the conclusion rather than letting it be fully embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation to seek "tenuous absolution" is both specific and deeply felt, driving every micro-choice from placing the bread to the guerrilla gardening. Interiority is rendered with poetic precision, particularly in the concept of "creeping normality" and how "grief gets folded into routine." The uncloaking is a powerful moment of embodied change, where an internal shift is made manifest with a clear before/after state, earning the final emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but it operates more as a high-concept existential premise than a deeply felt interior conflict. She is an impeccable vessel for the story's theme, showing her meticulous nature through action, but lacks the contradictory impulses or flaws that would elevate the characterization from highly competent to truly memorable. The awe she feels is earned, but her internal landscape remains pristine and somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is clear, complex, and embodied in action—from her calculated stumbles to her final, quiet retreat. Her interiority, particularly "fear had long since calcified into purpose," is established with potent economy. The final choice to walk away without gloating feels earned and perfectly aligned with a character who came to listen for a sound, not to claim a victory.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity, moving from "relentless doubt" to an earned trust. Her internal conflict is not merely stated but embodied through her actions—relying on the compass, then her sense of taste, and finally her witness. The final change, surrendering her defining skepticism, is a powerful and credible resolution earned by the on-page climax, foreclosing her old way of knowing with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The artist's motivation is rooted in a vividly rendered internal conflict between her public persona and her private "callings." Her defining trait—being "cursed to hoard memories like tombstones"—is not just stated but dramatized in the climax. The final shift from "victim" to "sovereign" is earned through the difficult, on-page act of confronting and releasing her past, culminating in the empathetic gesture of drawing a tear on her father's portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is relentless and deeply embodied through her unique "wilting" curse, which externalizes the story's core tension between truth and falsehood. Her transformation from seeker to "archive" is an earned and resonant change, directly tied to her core traits. The characterization is specific and compelling, avoiding all clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character is a potent archetype, a vessel for the story's theme, with a motivation that is clear and consistent. Her actions, like the smile "with shoulders, with spine," provide moments of genuine embodiment. However, she lacks significant internal conflict or flaws; she is a perfect instrument of her own ideals, which makes her feel more like a concept than a complex individual. This purity serves the fable-like tone but limits characterological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caretaker's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply integrated into its design and history. The internal conflict between nostalgia-as-anchor and static-as-overload is beautifully dramatized through the central metaphors. The final change feels earned, culminating in the "unprogrammed" smile—a powerful moment of emergent being. A slight deduction is for moments of diagnostic self-awareness, like defining the final state as "whole," which slightly abstracts the emotion rather than leaving it fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong and emotionally coherent. Elara's motivation is clear, and Leo's grief is embodied effectively. However, Elara verges on being a flawless archetype—the magical, empathetic facilitator—with little internal conflict or struggle, which slightly flattens her character. The dialogue, particularly the exchange "You're the curator," / "I hear things," is a bit too neat and borders on tagline, slightly reducing the scene's naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is both abstract and deeply embodied, a rare combination executed with precision. Her core drive “to encrypt vulnerability as strength” is not just stated but demonstrated in every calm, deliberate action. The final choice to become the cipher rather than escape is a powerful, earned culmination of this philosophy, with the cost of her physical self made starkly clear.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elira’s motivation is powerfully established and drives every action with quiet intensity. Her interiority is revealed through specific, embodied details like her trembling fingers, and her methodical cataloging of anomalies grounds her grief in purposeful action. The final choice to step through the portal is a perfectly earned culmination of her quest, with the cost of leaving her world behind felt in the strange suspension of the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, rooted in the clear, consistent creed of "flow." The internal conflict between her initial goal—to "hush a prophecy"—and her ingrained method of surrender is beautifully dramatized. The resolution, a shift in purpose from silencer to listener, is an earned change compelled by her core nature, with the cost of perpetual duty making the transformation meaningful. Her particularity transcends archetype through her unique methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation is both strange and deeply compelling, evolving from a lonely hobby into a reciprocal duty. The relationship with the archivist is a masterclass in subtext, with their shared, unspoken lies forming a crucible that forces the final, truthful exchange. The tutor's defining trait, "patiently nimble," is beautifully embodied through consistent, subtle actions rather than being a mere label.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation to "archive" rather than "heal" is compelling and consistent. Her interiority is vividly rendered, but dips into diagnostic self-awareness with lines like, "This was her alchemy: turning solitude into sovereignty..." This over-articulation slightly flattens the embodied emotion, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in a desire “to forgive the unfinished,” which elevates the political act into a personal one. Her interiority is concrete, especially the shift from trembling with fear to trembling with “the weight of wisely enduring.” The character arc is beautifully encapsulated in the final lines, changing this state to “wisely released,” a subtle but powerful earned change. The character is defined by her precise, deliberate actions, which align perfectly with her past as a master calligrapher.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, specific, and evolves under pressure, from a seeker of knowledge to a healer. The final choice—to sing a lullaby rather than a song of destruction—is a powerful culmination of her established character, driven by "reed-blown melancholy" instead of rage. This choice feels earned and creates a resonant closure, with the physical cost ("throat raw") underlining the authenticity of her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is crystalline and her actions are consistent, creating a coherent character portrait. Her interiority is rendered in evocative, poetic language. However, for the highest tier, the story relies on describing her competence rather than dramatizing it against a moment of genuine struggle or doubt; her key attribute, "weaves truth carefully," is never tested by a difficult choice, making her feel more like a perfect instrument than a flawed individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional, portraying the philosopher's internal state through concrete, resonant actions. Her motivation—to appreciate hidden effort—is not merely stated but deeply embodied in her history (the widow) and her present choices (whistling a name into the wind). The central contradiction of "demure audacity" is brilliantly sustained, culminating in a final act of witness that is both quiet and profound, earning its emotional weight without a single false note.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation to "excavate truth" is not just a label but a demonstrated drive that shapes every observation and choice. Her interiority is sharp and specific, particularly the moment she smiles "not in triumph, but in sorrow," which perfectly captures the weight of her discovery. The final choice to continue her work is an earned crystallization of her established traits, passing the 9+ test with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation—"fidelity—to the broken, the misfit, the ones who heard music in malfunction"—is both clearly stated and organically dramatized. The internal conflict between her deep-seated loneliness and her mission to connect with others culminates powerfully in the final act, where she sings a song born of that very loneliness to create a new community. Her competence is balanced with a believable world-weariness, making her a compelling, fully realized visionary.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and evolves organically from survival to a higher purpose, catalyzed by the music box. His backstory is sketched with effective brevity, grounding his later choices. The one significant flaw is the final poem, which functions as a too-neat summary of his internal arc; a character shouldn't articulate their own thematic journey with such diagnostic clarity ("I gleaned redemption...").

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's core trait, "logically emotional," is demonstrated effectively through her simultaneous calculation and awe. However, her competence is almost seamless ("She didn’t panic. She adapted."), which slightly lessens the feeling of a genuine struggle. The characterization is strong and consistent but could be elevated by a moment where her contradictory impulses create a more difficult internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, but she reads more as a mythic archetype or a vessel for the theme than a person with tangible flaws. Her interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting in the moment; she arrives fully formed in her wisdom. The story tells us she "sculpted patience from impatience," but we don't witness that struggle, which flattens her arc into a demonstration rather than a journey.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The investigator’s motivation evolves organically from professional duty to a deeply personal mission of witness, a change earned through her interactions with the lantern and the tunnel. Her interiority is sharp and specific, avoiding cliché; lines like “panic unravels truth” and “ignorance is armor—until it becomes a cage” reveal a complex worldview forged by experience. The final choice to request access to Tunnel 12 demonstrates a fully realized character arc, accepting the personal and professional cost of her new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear, compelling motivation rooted in guilt and love. Elias's internal conflict between self-flagellation and the need for peace is rendered with concrete interiority ("the quiet agony of precision"). The final character change is earned and resonant, but slightly weakened by diagnostic statements in the last few paragraphs, such as "He’d spent years preaching forgiveness...yet never granted it to himself," which states the theme rather than allowing the final image to carry its full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zeta's characterization is exceptional, defined by a potent mix of professional competence, irreverent curiosity, and a deep understanding of her absurd world. Her motivation is clear and consistent. The choice to use the arrow tip is a brilliant character-revealing action that demonstrates her insight, and her reaction—grinning at the absurdity of it all—cements a voice that is both pragmatic and wondrous. The final beat, where she is already sketching modifications, provides a perfect, forward-looking closure to her character arc within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation evolves credibly from professional curiosity to a deeply personal, obsessive quest. Her internal conflict is shown through purposeful action, particularly the sequence of lies that demonstrate her increasing commitment and isolation. The final shift from "hunter" to "anchor" is an earned and resonant change, secured by the cost of perpetual secrecy and vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict between the hardened "peacekeeper" and the hopeful "girl" is rendered with concrete detail, culminating in the final mirror scene. The motivation to "reconstitute" courage is abstract but made tangible through the ritual with the mirrors and crystal. The final shift to a "witness offering reflection" is a perfectly earned change, with the cost being the acceptance of permanent brokenness—"It wasn’t whole... But it was enough."

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation as "terminally curious" is both unique and psychologically compelling, avoiding suicide clichés. The internal conflict is expertly shown through her resentment of "miracles" and her shift from "gripping reality loosely" to letting it flow through her. This change is earned by the climactic experience, resulting in a credible and profound character arc with a clear, felt cost—the shedding of her old obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Characterization is the story’s great strength. Elias’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, while Mara’s shift from brittle resistance to quiet acceptance is earned and credible. The dialogue is exceptional, particularly the lines "poetry wrapped in dirt" and "translating a foreign hymn," which perfectly encapsulate their dynamic. A minor deduction is for the slightly over-articulated interiority, where motivation ("to nurture intersubjective understanding") is stated like a thesis rather than emerging purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, conveyed through embodied action and perception. Motivation is singular and clear, driving every beat. The internal state—a disciplined focus—is demonstrated rather than declared, with the mask serving as an elegant external signifier of the character's core duality ("mystery" vs. "discipline"). The cost of her effort is felt in the "muscles humming with spent focus," earning the final state of "unshakable, complete" calm.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization leans toward an archetype of serene wisdom rather than a complex individual. Her interiority is beautifully rendered in her perception of the photographs, but she lacks internal conflict or discernible flaws. Her single line of dialogue, "Mending the world," feels slightly too on-the-nose, summarizing her function rather than revealing a deeper layer of character.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is superb, establishing the scholar’s motivation and worldview with precision. Her defining trait of "reticent" makes her final, voiced answer a profound and costly act, fulfilling the story's arc. The internal state is rendered through specific, embodied actions—tracing spines, transcribing glyphs—which makes the final stillness and spoken words carry immense weight.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.7)
    The protagonist’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a powerful internal contradiction: a “precognitively forgetful mind.” Motivation is both deeply strange and utterly compelling, and his ritualistic actions are rendered with concrete specificity. The moment he weeps for a birthday song he doesn't recognize is a masterclass in embodied emotion, showing decay and sorrow without a shred of exposition. The final choice—to drop the chalk and accept the forgetting—is a perfect, earned culmination of his tragic nature.

    Elira's motivation is established with poetic precision—from harnessing the ephemeral in photography to restructuring time. Her interiority is rich, particularly the way her mentor’s quote about "escape velocity" frames her internal conflict, turning a physical concept into an existential goal. The pivotal choice to use a memory as her tool is a sublime expression of character, demonstrating a history and a hierarchy of values that prioritize tenderness over force.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is strong and consistent, with her motivation to "execute a flawless goodbye" providing a clear drive. Her identity as a "serene hospice music therapist" is not just a label; it directly informs her final actions. The story successfully earns her final change—an acceptance of imperfection—by rooting it in the central act of using a broken instrument. The only hairline weakness is that her internal conflict, while present, lacks a sharp, contradictory impulse acting *simultaneously* in-scene; her path to acceptance is a bit too smooth for a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, "quietly deliberate," is demonstrated consistently through her actions. However, her interiority lacks depth; emotional states are more declared ("the question gnawed at her") than embodied. The character works perfectly as a lens for the story's concept, but her internal conflict and personal texture remain somewhat underdeveloped for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The "forgiving skeptic" is a compelling, non-stock internal contradiction, and her motivation to "recompose" rather than avenge is both clear and sophisticated. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, particular language ("the quiet architecture of redemption"). The final earned change—from a private practitioner to a future teacher—is subtle but significant, showing a credible progression earned by the on-page ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in her traumatic past, and her interiority is rendered with poetic precision, particularly through the grandmother's resonant wisdom about stillness. The final shift from doubt to surrender is earned through the ritualistic action, making the quiet emotional climax feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied through her interaction with the setting. Her actions, particularly placing the confession under the moss, demonstrate a credible shift. However, a few phrases like "curating this sanctuary where vulnerability could be protected, not punished" and stopping "waiting for permission to heal" lean into diagnostic self-awareness, slightly undermining the otherwise subtle interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.4)
    The novelist’s internal conflict between the market’s demand for closure and her own artistic truth is rendered with exceptional clarity and embodied emotion. Her motivation is consistent and deepens from a need to “solemnize” to a realization about “release.” The final choice to write is fully earned by the preceding journey, with the cost being the abandonment of a conventional creative model, making the final moment of gratitude powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is strong and consistent. Her motivation is established early and drives every action, while her paradoxical nature as a tinkerer using melodies is beautifully embodied in her salvaged-gear flute. Her interiority is revealed through action—"She didn't force the melody. She listened"—which is more powerful than simple exposition. The long-term cost of her seventeen-year preparation lends significant weight to her choices in this single, pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemist’s character is conveyed with superb physical discipline and singular motivation. Her interiority is revealed through precise, reverent actions, particularly the use of her own blood not for magic but for "signature... for love," a choice that powerfully establishes her values. While the portrayal of unwavering competence is masterful, the story operates more as a portrait than a crucible; the absence of any on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulse, even a flicker of doubt, holds it just shy of the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The locksmith's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, articulated as a philosophical drive for preservation. His interiority is rich with unique concepts ("physics wearing poetry’s coat"), avoiding cliché. However, the characterization remains in a state of serene competence; there is little on-page internal contradiction or struggle against his own flaws, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The weaver's internal conflict—being "boundary-lessly trapped" by a "purpose"—is expertly dramatized, not just stated. The final choice to calcify her own burden is an earned, powerful act of endurance, perfectly encapsulating her character in a moment of profound stasis. Her contradictory impulses are active on the page, culminating in a choice with a clear and heavy cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    Eleanor's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to manage grief is not just stated but embodied in concrete actions and a unique interior voice. The shift from "containing" memory to "harvesting lessons" feels earned and psychologically true. The line describing her grief as "hauntingly practical—like checking smoke detectors or labeling jars" is a moment of brilliant, character-particular insight that grounds her entire struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, driving a compelling internal conflict. The contradiction between hoarding others' dreams and developing her own is dramatized effectively, culminating in a final choice—giving the ghost the camera—that feels earned and significant. Interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular language (e.g., regret as a dull weight in the joints), and the change to non-regret is a powerful, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira's characterization is strong and consistent, with her actions perfectly aligning with her "functionally creative" mind. Her motivation is clear and drives the narrative. However, the story presents her as almost flawlessly competent, lacking an internal conflict or a moment of significant struggle that would reveal deeper, contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias's character is rendered with exceptional depth. His internal conflict between the disciplined safety of his present and the ache of his past is embodied in concrete actions, from polishing brass to tracing old scores. The final change is earned not through a grand act, but a quiet, credible shift in perspective, making his renunciation of the grand symphony for a simple hum feel profound and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The seeker's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority operates at a high level of abstraction. Phrases like "the architecture of lies" or "the temperature of forgotten time" feel more authorial than character-particular. While his actions (waiting, kneeling, retrieving) align with his motives, the character functions more as a thoughtful vessel for the theme than an individual with palpable internal contradictions acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary, particularly in its economy. The protagonist’s motivation is established through a single, potent line about preserving “living rhythms,” and her worthiness is proven not by speech but by her calloused hands—a powerful, concrete detail that grounds her philosophy in labor. Havel is drawn with similar precision, his skepticism and deep knowledge conveyed through gnarled fingers and a voice like “pebbles rolling.” The central dynamic, built on patience and earned trust, feels both archetypal and deeply specific.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptionally coherent and serves the story's conceptual core. The traveler's motivation—"orientation," not closure—is rooted in a consistent, specific philosophy. Interiority is concrete, expressed through the act of "intimate cartography." The character is defined by a powerful, earned stasis, crystallized in the final declaration: "They did not pray. They did not hope. They mapped." While in-scene internal conflict is minimal, this choice serves the story's meditative, resolute tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prince's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, acting as the story's marrow. His internal state—a blend of exhaustion, hope, and stubborn obsession—is embodied through his trembling fingers and hollow eyes, avoiding abstraction. The final choice is a culmination of this unwavering drive, and the emotional release feels deeply earned, fulfilling the character arc with a cost paid in years of solitary effort.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a deeply felt and embodied internal conflict. The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—firefighter by trade, arsonist's daughter by blood—are not merely stated but dramatized through her ritualistic actions and memories. Her final choice to engage with her father's remorse ("Sing with me") is a powerful, earned resolution that demonstrates a complex hierarchy of values, moving beyond simple forgiveness to active harmonization.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist is exceptionally well-realized through the central contradiction of being a "luminous skeptic." Her motivation for liberation is clear and her methods—honoring meaning while seeking scientific origin—are consistently dramatized. The character's core philosophy ("the plausible miracle, the scientific ghost") is not merely stated but enacted, making her choices feel both inevitable and profound. Her interiority is revealed with precision through patient, observant action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sentimentalist's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained. The internal conflict is elegantly externalized through the history of the gear and the contrast with their ancestors. The final beat of "troubling serenity" provides a sophisticated emotional texture, showing a complex character state beyond simple success and earning the story’s conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is strong and his motivation to map collective grief provides a clear, compelling engine for the narrative. The final change from solitary intellectualizer to connected participant feels earned and lands with emotional weight. A line like "He believed grief had geometry" borders on being too diagnostically self-aware, but it's a minor slip in an otherwise beautifully rendered interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation and internal conflict are rendered with convincing specificity. His transformation from a steward of mechanical perfection to a witness of organic grace is earned through the story's central revelation. The choice to surrender is a powerful renunciation that lands with emotional weight, but the final paragraphs drift slightly into intellectual summary (“Incremental absolution, he realized…”) rather than sustaining the purely embodied experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The gardener's initial "blithe" nature is effectively contrasted with her "unspooling grief," creating a compelling internal contradiction that motivates the journey. Her transformation from a passive soother (humming lullabies) to an active interrogator (whispering questions) is earned through the central ordeal, providing a powerful and satisfying arc with a clear, felt cost—the loss of simple comfort for complex wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cartographer’s motivation is powerfully established, and her internal arc—moving from forcing grandeur to coaxing resonance—is earned through reflection that directly informs her climactic choice. While more of an archetype than a deeply idiosyncratic individual, her focused interiority and embodied ritual make her compelling and perfectly suited to the story's conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is established immediately as a powerful act of rebellion, and her evolution from a passive preserver to an active creator is both surprising and inevitable. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail ("heart thudding like a timpani roll"). The final choice to broadcast is earned by the preceding revelations, and the cost—embracing the vulnerability of mourning to activate the "code"—is made legible and felt on the page, satisfying the 9+ test with distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, presenting a protagonist defined by a powerful internal contradiction: a deliberate grace that handles fractured things. Her motivation is clear and rooted in a concretely rendered past (the mask from her mother's teacups), making her philosophy feel earned, not just stated. The final moment of Earned Stasis, where she chooses stillness over the "mirage of safety," is a credible and resonant renunciation that lands with the quiet cost of her continued, willed isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently dramatized through specific, idiosyncratic actions rather than summary. His "rationally rebellious" nature is perfectly embodied in his quiet, evidence-based opposition, and the core internal conflict is shown in the contrast between his “agonized” pacing and his “abrasive calm.” The chronometer cog serves as a potent, concrete anchor for his entire value system, making his final stance of endurance feel both earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored in the specific and potent internal state of “expectantly resigned.” This is not merely a label but a fully embodied condition that motivates her quiet endurance and shapes her perception of the world. The final choice to teach is a powerful crystallization of this stance, earned by decades of waiting, with the cost of that long vigil felt in her “traveled stillness.”

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional. Her unique ability to "taste memories" is not a gimmick but the core of her worldview and motivation. The internal conflict—rewiring her own grief into something useful—is beautifully embodied in the physical act of pruning, and her final shift from private chef to communal curator feels both earned and profound. The motivation of "gentle rebellion" is perfectly dramatized in her choice to water the seed with a specific, formative memory, making her transformation deeply personal and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistently drives his actions, particularly the climactic reveal. The woman serves as an effective catalyst. However, Elias's core trait of being "involuntarily truthful" is more of a colorful characteristic than a constraint that forces a difficult, costly choice on the page; the plot doesn't truly test it. The final dialogue exchange is also a bit too perfectly aligned, functioning more as thematic summary than natural interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is both unique and deeply felt, established immediately and driving every action. Interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic specifics ("a sliver of suspended time that clung like pollen to the inside of her ribs"), avoiding cliché. The final acceptance of her role is an earned endurance that provides a powerful sense of closure without needing a dramatic change.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The historian serves more as a receptive vessel than a character with deep internal contradictions; her shift from career-long certainty to new purpose is too swift and frictionless to feel fully earned. While the statue's motivation is clear, the protagonist's journey relies on the convenient assertion that she was chosen for her "wonder" rather than on a dramatized, difficult choice revealing her values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is both abstract and viscerally clear, driving every action. The internal conflict of the “grim optimist” is not just stated but dramatized through his "balancedly daring" methodology. The final change is a masterful stroke of earned nuance—he doesn't defeat regret, he integrates its texture, making the character's endurance credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The painter’s motivation is crystalline and drives the narrative, but her characterization leans toward a flawless archetype. She is "methodically hopeful, never frantic, never despairing," which serves the story's gentle tone but sacrifices the texture of internal conflict. A moment of doubt or a choice complicated by a personal flaw would have elevated her from a beautiful vessel for the theme into a more complex, memorable individual.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her shift from seeking ghosts to framing life provides a satisfying arc. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she operates as a figure of near-perfect resolve against external apathy. The absence of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure keeps this from the highest tier, as her struggle is presented as entirely external.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is powerful and consistently drives the narrative. The internal conflict culminates in the final "bitter and bright" smile, an excellent portrayal of contradictory emotion. However, his competence is presented as nearly absolute—the "neatly inventive mind" feels more like a fixed label than a quality tested under pressure, which slightly flattens his struggle against the cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong and the protagonist's motivation to "unbosom" is compelling and consistent. The change is earned through a costly internal confrontation. However, the dialogue in the final confrontation veers into diagnostic label-speak ("You’re the hunted thought. The echo I keep feeding."), which slightly undermines the earned, embodied nature of the discovery by over-articulating the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exemplary. The Prophet’s motivation, "to turn obstacles into instruments," is not merely stated but rigorously dramatized through every action, culminating in his euphoric response to the thickening sea. The apprentice Kael’s arc from passive recorder to active participant provides a powerful, earned closure, with the mallet toss serving as a perfect crucible moment that reconfigures their relationship and his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation—the "hollow ache of unanswered questions"—is both clear and deeply felt, manifesting in tangible actions like her seventeen-season research and etching names into her whistle. Her defining trait, "quietly driven," is masterfully demonstrated rather than told, culminating in the final, earned decision to confront the watchers. The choice feels inevitable, a perfect crystallization of a character defined by relentless, private conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.5)
    The historian's characterization is superb, particularly the concept of being "emotionally rational." This isn't just a label; it's demonstrated through her calibrated response to the letter and her strategic, empathetic plan for revealing the truth. The internal conflict is sophisticated—not about *if* she should reveal the truth, but *how*—which is driven by a consistent and nuanced hierarchy of values. Her motivation is clear, her competence is balanced with the immense weight of her task, and her entire being feels inextricable from the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is established with poetic precision and her defining trait—“stoically sensitive”—is not merely stated but dramatized, culminating in the earned release of tears. Her internal conflict is shown through the contrast between her methodical, ritualistic actions and the deep empathy driving them. The final transformation into a “priestess” is a powerful and credible evolution, earned by the events of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and her professional competence is brilliantly dramatized. However, her interiority lacks a moment of genuine contradiction or self-doubt; her tranquility and perception are presented as fixed attributes rather than states maintained under pressure. This slight lack of internal friction keeps an otherwise flawless portrayal just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.6)
    Silas’s motivation—grief—is not merely stated but fully embodied in his craft and choices. The internal conflict between preservation and the need for release is masterfully dramatized, culminating in an earned transformation. The final choice to shatter his life's work carries a visible, resonant cost, fulfilling the highest standards of character arc within this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation, “not for vengeance, but for where unused potential pools,” is a powerful and specific driver born directly from her trauma. Interiority is rendered with precise, memorable language like “calibrated desperation” and “threading equations through grief like sutures through flesh,” which avoids diagnostic labels. The final choice is a perfect crystallization of this established character, earned with the visible cost of a life dedicated to a solitary, uncertain quest.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong. The pilot's internal conflict between her professional, hardened self and a buried longing is palpable. Her transformation is earned through the on-page experience with the chip, culminating in a believable emotional release. The final shift from "scanning for threats" to being "simply present" provides a powerful, earned closure to her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s motivation is clear, embodied, and drives the entire narrative arc from seeking to quell a tremor to shouldering a new purpose. The internal contradiction between her assumed past and the revealed truth is powerful. The final paragraphs border on over-articulating her new state of mind, slightly lessening the impact of her earned change, but the core arc is exceptionally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is not just stated but embodied in her every action, from her tactile connection to the drawer pull to her focus on listening. Her internal conflict between "old rage" and earned peace is resolved through a credible, earned act of mutual vulnerability. The secondary character is rendered with equal depth in just a few lines; his weariness and the revelation that he "memorized them" provide a powerful counterpoint and justification for the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exceptionally well-realized, filtering the world through the specific lens of a navigator's grief. Motivation is clear and compelling. The only minor weakness is a tendency toward diagnostic self-awareness in a few lines, such as describing her coping as “merrily melancholic,” which feels slightly too articulate for a character in this state of crisis, momentarily stepping back from embodiment to label it.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is stark, clear, and compellingly unconventional—not redemption, but the kindling of empathy. This internal goal is beautifully externalized in the final choice to release the baseball, earning a resonant change from a “hollow vessel” to one carrying a “map inside.” Kael’s brief appearance is perfectly weighted, serving as a catalyst without overshadowing the seeker’s internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal state is embodied with rich, specific imagery ("the quiet certainty of tectonic plates shifting beneath her soul"). The final transformation is earned through an act of surrender. However, the core internal conflict (skepticism vs. faith) is resolved before the story begins, slightly weakening the in-scene pressure; the on-page journey is one of resolve rather than struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is intensely clear, and her internal arc from seeking reclamation to granting release is earned with palpable cost. The character’s flaw—surrender to routine—is elegantly confronted in the resolution. Her final transformation from "cartomancer" to "mother" is a powerful, earned shift that lands with significant emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clearly defined motivation and a compelling internal conflict. The pacifist nature is skillfully used as the source of the core "shadow work" struggle. The only minor weakness is the shadow's dialogue ("You carried me like a wound... Now carry me like a wing"), which verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly over-articulating the psychological turn at a peak moment instead of letting the image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with superb clarity and then dramatized through a sustained, ritualistic sequence. Her internal state—a blend of profound loss and serene purpose—is embodied in her actions and the environment's response. The turn where she absorbs her own unlived life is a moment of earned, devastating recognition, making her final transformation from destitute to radiant entirely credible. This is exceptional character work, where internal contradictions resolve through action with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist is a well-realized archetype whose core trait—"calmly inventive"—is demonstrated through meticulous action rather than just stated. Her motivation is clear and compelling. However, the characterization stops short of exceptional because there is no moment of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse dramatized on the page; she reads as almost flawlessly competent, which, while fitting the tone, slightly flattens her interiority and lowers the felt personal stakes of the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in the "lingering promise" he carries like a "stone in his chest." The internal conflict between his precognitive "curse" and the hope it might be a tool is dramatized through his actions, not just stated. The final transformation from seeing his ability as a "sentence" to a "gift" feels earned, culminating in the powerful, embodied image of his soundless laugh in the frictionless air.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, particular language. Her internal conflict between remembering and enduring is held in a sustained, believable tension. The final stance of endurance is earned through the preceding ritual and reflection, making the character arc feel complete and profound within the story’s brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, establishing the philosopher’s persona through his precise actions and internal focus rather than exposition. His core trait, “diplomatically fierce,” is masterfully demonstrated in the climax when he refuses to gloat. The dynamic with the woman is established with remarkable economy, built on a history of intellectual fencing that makes their immediate, synchronized partnership feel earned and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.6)
    Molt’s characterization is exceptional. The core concept of “molting personalities” is masterfully paid off, shifting from a monthly, perhaps defensive, habit to a profound transformation triggered by grief. Her motivation is clear and deeply felt, and the final shift from sardonic cynic to “gardener of the impossible” is earned through a sequence of resonant actions, fulfilling the 9+ test of a final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira's motivation is audacious yet clear, and her character is revealed through highly specific actions—mapping harmonics, decoding the film—that embody her stated "strategically creative" nature. The internal conflict between wistful grief and "steely longing" is beautifully dramatized through her precise, calculated performance. The final choice is perfectly earned by the preceding causality, showing a character defined by both profound loss and formidable will.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and is dramatized through his meticulous actions and his core internal conflict—the fear of misinterpretation. The internal conflict between duty and doubt is potent, and its resolution via a remembered piece of wisdom feels earned within the story's compressed timeframe. The final state of weary, quiet satisfaction is a perfectly calibrated emotional closure for a character defined by seventeen monsoons of thankless, vital work.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elio’s characterization is conveyed with superb economy. His motivation is singular and clear—to find and diffuse the color of regret—and his actions align perfectly with it. The interiority is concrete and poetic, expressed through his perception (e.g., "blue as silence after a slammed door"), and his internal state is shown, not told. The final smile and whisper provide a subtle but earned sense of completion, a quiet confirmation of his philosophy that is earned by the preceding ritual.

    The undertaker's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from resignation to stubborn action, rooted in consistent traits like his lifelong dedication to rest; interiority is concrete and embodied, especially in the trembling hands that steady at closure, revealing a meaningful endurance with felt cost. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in his initial reluctance versus the flare of resolve, with emotions layered contradictorily under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira's motivation for intergenerational support is clear and intensifies through persistent actions, with embodied emotions like her smile at the note revealing quiet resilience; internal conflict shows in her choice to maintain anonymity despite gratitude, earning a meaningful endurance with felt cost of ongoing isolation. Secondary characters like Kael and Maris apply relevant pressure by joining anonymously, enhancing relationships as crucible without overwhelming scope. The bell as a recurring object reveals her values through micro-choices, such as not ringing it until the end. Flaws are minor, with no stock phrasing, but interiority could deepen contradictory impulses in the soup gathering scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The artist's motivation to trace unused love is clear and rooted in her spiritually curious traits, intensifying through breath-guided choices that culminate in a meaningful renunciation of her prior beliefs with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her trembling hands and hitched breath during the obscura adjustment, revealing internal conflict under pressure. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but her flaws, like gnawing curiosity, complicate her journey without safety-hedging. The final realization reweights her values, earned by prior micro-choices like altering breath at forks.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)

The “heat-mapping” method is a credible extension of her expertise; the final smile and palm-to-floor gesture crystallize her earned stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The undertaker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—trembling hands, aching molars—yet the “inadvertently stubborn” trait is asserted more than dramatized until late. His micro-choice to dismantle and re-embed the lens is credible and costly, but the shift from resignation to resolve could be seeded earlier to tighten causality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“thumb worn smooth by decades of prayer and protest”), but the story withholds her contradictions; her motives are stated rather than dramatized in tension. The final renunciation—passing the bell without claiming credit—earns its cost, yet we never see her wrestle with the temptation to reveal herself.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the artist’s breath-counting and trembling hands under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation (“where is unused love stored?”) is consistent and intensifies to the climactic surrender. The pilgrim remains a silhouette, so relationship crucible is absent, but the single POV sustains depth. Final permeation feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to preserve memory vs. to feel time’s texture) are dramatized in the moment she caresses the halo. The final renunciation—accepting the garden’s symbiotic feeding on her past—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: the “texture” obsession is stated more than tested until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the liberator’s tactile relationship with soil and seeds grounds her motives. Contradictory impulses—patient strategy vs. urgent sowing—play out in micro-choices (pressing keys, planting arrow). Final renunciation (leaving the acorn key) crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid, embodied, and character-specific; the marrow countdown and sensory grafts anchor motivation. The final choice—pressing the memory-catcher to her temple—earns its cost through prior absences fed to the forge. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, but the single POV and compressed length still yield a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied ("moved like a sigh," "heart pounding not with triumph but tenderness"), but the thief’s contradictory impulses remain static; no new internal friction is forced by the final beat, so the arc feels complete yet unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“molten silica just before it finds its final shape”), but the arc is more symbolic than causal; the glassblower’s renunciation is felt yet not driven by contradictory impulses in scene. Motivation is consistent, but the cost is poetic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—“move like fear given legs,” “trembling certainty is my armor”—but the mentor remains off-page, so status/relationship crucible is absent. The final renunciation (burning the reel) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. Flaws (phobia, hypervigilance) complicate tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Oracle’s obsession with “charting absence” is vivid, but her choices remain observational—no decisive micro-choice under pressure; the final descent is atmospheric rather than a crucible that alters her stance or costs her something new.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise, embodied, and character-specific; the robot’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. composure) play out in scene. The final realization—“its first thought hadn’t been programmed. It had been a reaction—to being seen”—is earned by the recursive loops and carries visible cost (violin melts, sweeping becomes listening). Micro-choices (tuning to emotional frequency, pausing mid-sweep) reveal shifting values under pressure. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her breath, the cool lens against her ribs, the deliberate stillness. The micro-choice to place the tickets and lens is causally tied to her goal and visibly costs her the tool. Relationships shift through gesture rather than speech, satisfying the crucible test. The only gap is a slight under-articulation of her internal contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vine dresser’s interiority is textured and embodied; her tactile communion with soil and marbles reveals a lived, contradictory stance toward data-driven gardening. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies through the quiet refusal to replant, culminating in an Earned Stasis that costs her institutional standing. The single on-page relationship (with the intern) functions as crucible, forcing her stance crystallization. Minor slip: the “wisely pragmatic” label is stated rather than dramatized in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her mechanically warm resolve, the scar she doesn’t remember, the 2.7-degree lever adjustment—yet the adjacent-Elira beat is the only moment of visible internal contradiction. Motivation is consistent and intensifies, but the cost (risk of losing the present) is implied rather than dramatized on the page. The single POV keeps focus tight; no relationship crucible is required.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"trembling resonance of her cello’s mute body strapped to her back like armor"—but the contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (playing silently) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she leaves the program dry, the ghost dissolved, her purpose crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the fevered smudge on the orchid anchors her guilt. The final stance—pinning the drawing to the railing—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor: the oracle’s “poetry” edges toward therapeutic label-speak, blunting contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is sharp and embodied (“drowsy alertness,” “static after sleep”), motives track cleanly from skepticism to self-confrontation. The swallowed-truth motif is dramatized through micro-choices—touching the valve, pocketing the radio—rather than told. A credible Earned Stasis closes the arc: she leaves the valve, accepts the cost. Minor slip: the father-confession backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that edges the 20 % ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is vivid—trembling palms, weeping for beauty—but the story withholds any concrete micro-choice under pressure; witnessing is passive, so the arc feels observational rather than earned. No contradictory impulses are dramatized; the keeper’s stance is static, softened wax rather than altered by cost. The final smile is resonant yet unmotivated by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is gentle and consistent, but her choices remain largely observational; the decisive act of passing the curl is under-motivated by prior micro-choices, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The historian’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingertips “reading whispers,” her palm sensing the wall’s hum—yet her decisive pivot to descend and weave is announced rather than dramatized, muting the cost of that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—solitude vs. communal orchestration—are embodied in nightly fortune typing and island offerings; his final renunciation of credit crystallizes the cost of anonymity. Interiority is concrete, filtered through kelp-salt windows and diesel coughs. Micro-choices (timing ferry drops, aligning beam) reveal a hierarchy of values. The flaw: we never feel genuine struggle or limitation; his competence feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    The priest’s interiority is vivid—cassock of tape, palette of indigo—but the possession remains abstract; we feel his doubt yet never see a concrete choice that costs him something palpable. His final renunciation is elegant but emotionally muffled, so the change reads more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the homesick ache and ritualized mapping feel lived-in. Motivation (conduct unheard symphonies) is clear and escalates to a costly, earned renunciation. One micro-choice—pressing the shell to release the final memory—carries visible cost as the candle snuffs and the lake cracks. Flaws are implied rather than dramatized, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her hovering feet, the tablet’s pulse against her chest—but the final integration of “branching selves” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid. Micro-choices (touching walls, speaking confessions) are present, yet the climactic merger with echoes lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push this to 9+. Still, contradictory impulses (fear vs. defiance) coexist credibly in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied deafness and tactile musicianship are vivid; the pivot from numbness to catalyst is earned through the needle experiment. Interiority is concrete, but the “numbness” label flirts with diagnostic shorthand. Micro-choice (rigging the reversed Bach) crystallizes her value hierarchy and costs her prior serenity. Students’ reactions are sketched rather than individuated, yet the relational crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s meticulous nature is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—sketching the courtyard, noting barometric drift, selecting tools—each aligning with his trait and escalating stakes. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the decision to act laterally is earned by prior solitude and the Bureau’s betrayal. The only minor drag is that the “cost” of his new stance is implied rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—knees buckling, trembling precision—yet the final shift from fear to resolve feels slightly under-motivated; the “why now” hinge is implied rather than dramatized. The aromatic caution trait is consistently applied and visibly constrains action. The micro-choice to repurpose the UV lamp crystallizes values, but the cost of that repurposing is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s tactile obsession with the rope is embodied and specific; her refusal to judge Silas crystallizes her “ethically playful” stance. Interior contradiction surfaces when she celebrates his evasion yet still seeks its texture. The final choice—to leave the rope as bridge rather than archive—carries visible cost: she relinquishes her private archive for communal use. Motivation stays consistent, but the shift from solitary inquiry to social intervention is earned by prior pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “kneels where the greenhouse floor dips”), and her motive to “unbind” is dramatized through the bow strokes that literally alter the space. The final smile is earned because every micro-choice—tuning, bowing, accepting the petal—flows from the same creed. Minor drift: the child appears late and remains a witness rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vael’s contradictory impulses—profit-driven detachment vs. buried longing for authentic connection—are dramatized in the static-charged handling of the petal and the deliberate destruction of her stock. The renunciation is earned by prior interior contradiction and carries visible cost (lost livelihood, social standing). Interiority is embodied and specific; no diagnostic self-talk intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s shift from profit to purpose is credible and embodied in the quiet deliveries; the locket photo anchors his internal contradiction. However, the interiority is occasionally abstract (“felt the weight…in memory”) and the cost of his nightly labor remains more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her loneliness is braided into every reed spiral. The moment she presses palms to the arbor and whispers her “truest self” crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she renounces anonymity and accepts the burden of becoming the grafting point. Secondary characters remain lightly sketched yet serve as living proof of the web’s pull. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies toward the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the illustrator’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) act simultaneously in the climax. Motivation to “find the place where echoes are born” is dramatized through each borrowed second and the searing pendant. The final renunciation—closing the sketchbook and accepting fatigue—earns the cost of borrowed time. No stock phrasing; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—ink-stained fingers, saltwater refracting light—yet her contradictory impulses (grief vs curiosity) remain simultaneous rather than alternating. The micro-choice to leave one glass eye as a beacon crystallizes her arc and carries visible cost. Twin absence is felt rather than explained, avoiding diagnostic speak. Only a slight over-articulation of “mathematics of emotion” keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“dust on fingertips,” “slow erosion of soul”), motivation remains coherent, and the final renunciation—choosing partial visibility without spectacle—carries felt cost. The crawl-space dweller’s contradictory impulses (longing to be seen vs. fear of exposure) act simultaneously in the placement of the tape fragment. Minor deduction for the off-page intern who lacks individuated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from detached observer to participant is earned through visible micro-choices (lowering clippers, tearing pages). The cost—abandoning years of method—lands with felt weight. One minor slip: “circuitously sincere” is asserted rather than dramatized in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s insomnia and compulsion to “thresh meaning” are embodied in every brushstroke and sleepless night; her contradictory impulses—clinging to the brooch yet apologizing to it—play out in scene. The final renunciation (sleep at last) is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never clinical. Minor: the “wryly earnest” shield is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the clairvoyant’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. wonder) play out in real time. Motivation to “magnify everyday magic” is stated early and re-activated at closure, though the micro-choice to accept the shadows feels slightly under-cued. Relationship pressure with the pilgrim is minimal—he functions more as mirror than crucible—so the score caps shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s interiority is concrete and embodied; her “salt clinging to her woolen shawl like forgotten prayers” anchors motive. Micro-choices—matching a widow’s melody to the valve, cross-referencing tide logs—show reactive vision in action. The final renunciation (no statues, only spoken names) is earned and carries visible social cost. Interior contradiction is implied but not dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is precise—her “analytically artistic” trait is dramatized in how she overlays “charcoal and calculus” on city grids, and the punch’s dissolution into a silver needle crystallizes her earned renunciation. The contradiction between mapping control and surrendering to the chorus of truths is embodied in the final beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s skeptical kindness is embodied in her tactile handling of the tile and her refusal to force a solution; the interior contradiction between doubt and wonder drives every micro-choice and is paid for in the quiet cost of leaving the mystery unresolved yet shared.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The immortal’s craving for “finality” is clear and consistent, but interiority stays abstract—“ennui” and “wonder” are named rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final kneel feels inevitable rather than costly. Still, the arc from boredom to reverence is legible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central character—"the child"—carries a clear, interior contradiction (inheriting deceit yet seeking fairness) embodied in calibrated micro-choices: stealing the ink, rearranging scalpels, timing footsteps, capping the pot. Their motive expands rather than explains with each measured gesture, and the final readiness to wait actively for their father crystallizes an earned, costly position.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stationer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her ear to the lamp, trembling notepad—yet the final choice to leave the book open feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is implied rather than dramatized on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory stance—living yet officially dead—anchors every micro-choice; his refusal to correct the error and his compulsive layering of fragments crystallize into an earned stasis whose cost is the permanent exile from ordinary human recognition. Interiority is embodied in tactile scavenging and the pin-prick of the poison label against his coat. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; the lone figure’s self-imposed isolation is consistent and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs”), motives are consistent, and the final renunciation is earned. The contradiction between seeking answers and refusing to speak is dramatized through the shell-cello ritual. Minor slip: the sister remains off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses (order vs. anarchy) are embodied in every micro-choice—mapping chaos, painting murals, pocketing the stone—yet the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed; the “ache” is told more than dramatized in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inspector’s quiet ache to witness and her decision to keep vigil rather than merely document are embodied in micro-choices (brushing frost, lowering camera, whispering farewell). The interior contradiction—wanting to archive yet refusing to look back—charges the final image with felt cost. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible waived. Earned renunciation lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied perception and tactile method are vivid; her calm-as-compass trait is consistent and drives every micro-choice. The final release of the drone crystallizes her arc without overt statement. Minor: the botanist remains a respectful cipher, so relationship crucible pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The editor’s dry wit and obsessive precision are vivid and embodied; the interior contradiction between editing maps and seeking living origins is dramatized in the condensation ritual. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the final renunciation of editing for witnessing. The falcon functions as extension rather than second character, so relationship crucible is N/A. One hairline slip: “subtly confident smirk” is label-adjacent, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell tuner’s interiority is sparse yet embodied—her patience is dramatized through metronomic footfalls and the fork’s weight in her palm. Motivation (“restore shared balance”) is stated early and fulfilled, but the absence of internal contradiction or felt personal cost keeps her just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—survival vs surrender—are dramatized in the moment she forces her hand open; the embodied panic and final renunciation feel earned. Interiority is specific, sensory, and free of label-speak. One character on page, but the stakes are personal and the cost absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The son’s motivation—threading his own story before discovery—drives every beat; the embodied dread in “palms slick against the rust” and the kneel to the first spectral hand crystallize his arc. Interiority stays concrete, but the father’s “noose of mistrust” is asserted more than dramatized, trimming depth. Closure choice—sealing truth into the lens—carries visible cost and earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ghost bride’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains consistent: her “lovingly venomous” stance is embodied in the gentle press of the bead against bark and the silent transmission of memory. Elara’s micro-choice—accepting the bead—crystallizes the debt-to-gift arc. The final infusion of the bride into orchard and heir carries a felt cost (loss of singular identity) that is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the needle-scars and salt-tongue details root motive in flesh. The final choice to mend rather than burn/bury the plate crystallizes a value hierarchy (ancestral gravity vs. guild rules) with visible cost (scars, sleepless return). Yet the “hauntingly optimistic” label is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice, and the contradiction between dream-logic and deliberate craft could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is textured through soil under nails, root-cradled wrists, and the whispered “Show me what you measured,” all anchoring her contradictory need to both listen and re-orient. The arc from cautious enchantment to weeping at the chime is embodied, not labeled, and the cost—permanent exile from diaspora into orchard custodian—lands with the roots that cradle her like a returned child. No stock phrasing; every micro-choice (trowel, brushing moss, fitting the final stone) externalizes the hierarchy of values. The only slip is a hairline moment of overt thematic self-diagnosis in “Faith, she understood…,” but it is brief and does not rupture the prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“aching need” felt in the kneeling posture), yet the single POV never crystallizes a decisive choice on the page; the final stance is more reverie than action, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the embroiderer's contradictory impulses (listening vs. acting, hiding vs. revealing) play out in micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—continuing to stitch while the coup fails—earns its cost through prior causality. Status dynamics with courtiers and conspirators are sketched economically and shape tactics. Flaws (underestimation, secrecy) drive both success and ongoing danger.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“scratches from brambles, burns from spectral touch”), but the medium’s contradictory impulses remain largely poetic rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice is credible and earned, yet the cost is more lyrical than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—translator’s precision vs. anesthetic drift—are embodied in the coral’s pulse and the act of pressing it to the cast. The micro-choice to whisper “You’re not forgotten” crystallizes her value hierarchy and forecloses escape; the cost is the ache she now must carry. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into therapy-speak. Only the “lotus-hearted ache” label nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interior contradiction—technique vs. unguarded delight—drives every beat; the fresco fragment acts as embodied catalyst, her laughter at the climax is an earned, visible cost. Reflection stays anchored to present tactile cues and alters her next choice. No head-count or relationship crucible required. Micro-choices (angling lenses, pocketing the fragment) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—precision vs surrender—are dramatized in the tactile choices (nickel, tuning fork, palm press) and culminate in the earned renunciation of her restorer identity; the cost is felt in the final river-stone heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid—seed under tongue, humming lullaby—yet the shift from solitary rebel to community catalyst feels compressed; Dr. Vex’s pivot from suspicion to ally is credible but thinly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“centuries of longing had carved her bones hollow”), motives stay consistent, and the final renunciation—continuing to sing despite never sleeping—carries visible cost. The shy/unstoppable contradiction is dramatized through her refusal of pilgrims and the postcard’s new line. No headcount issues; single POV is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The caretaker’s refusal to breach her crack turns her endurance into an Earned Stasis: she sacrifices volume to keep the ghosts breathing, a deliberate price felt on the last breath of chime-note. Contradiction—the need to name versus her vow of non-summoning—plays out in embodied micro-choices as she sways against resonance, body trembling when names escape the crack.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The linguist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her shaking hands, trembling ink well, and micro-choice to test the vowel aloud all reveal the stakes. Motivation (restoring trust) is consistent and escalates from solitary obsession to communal risk. The final renunciation—singing the restored score—carries visible cost (betrayal risk) and earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The machinist is vividly embodied from the first line, contradictions in rigor/mercy flare live in the trembles at “weeping eye” and “volcano’s warmth”; her final sly recalibration is earned and the cost is felt in her dappled resolve without a single explanatory word.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s reinventions and her mother’s lullaby are embodied through tactile pigeon-work and meteorite calibration; the final refusal to keep forging new selves lands with visible cost when she laughs until her ribs ache and leaves the ledgers open. Interior contradictions (preservation vs erasure) play out in micro-choices—embedding the chip, redesigning harnesses—rather than exposition. The shift from secrecy to open composition is earned by prior pattern of flight logs becoming scores.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her tactile reading of wood grain and the micro-choice to step off the terrace crystallize her arc. The father’s sacrifice is felt through her body, not exposition. Minor drift: “featherly determined” is asserted rather than enacted until the final leap.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“gloved fingers brushing algae-slick corridors as if reading braille maps”), but the arc is more witness than choice; the final gesture of ascent is gentle acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Motivation remains steady—seeking belonging—yet lacks a contradictory impulse that complicates the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the recollectionist’s tactile seed-reading and trembling delight reveal contradictory impulses. Motivation (carry the mystery, not solve it) crystallizes in the final renunciation, earned by prior emotional transliterations. No secondary character pressure, but the grandmother memory anchors stakes without exposition drift.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “lightly attentive” stance is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (balancing pebbles, bowing to a soda cap). Motivation (serenading monotony) is consistent and intensifies via audience reactions, though the final beat is more stasis than costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is embodied in lunar pulse and bleeding soles; the contradiction between outlawed memory and bodily inscription drives every micro-choice. The final “to fledge” stance is earned by cumulative sacrifice—salt, sweat, blood—foreclosing return to the ban. Only the villagers’ sudden appearance feels slightly under-motivated, shaving the top tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"calloused fingers tracing the cool curve"—but the glazier’s contradictory impulses remain largely implicit; the final act of carrying the prism to Widow Hargrove crystallizes his stance with visible cost, yet the father memory feels slightly grafted rather than organically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the firefighter’s contradictory impulses—fear and duty—co-exist in the same beats. The final renunciation (leaving his own letter) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “gently skilled” is repeated as label rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“serene upheaval humming in her marrow”), but the dreamer’s contradictory impulses remain largely implicit; the final choice to “begin again” is credible yet feels more iterative than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“listened…with the hollow behind her ribs”), motives deepen from talisman to witness, but the decisive act of leaving the sketch feels slightly under-motivated relative to the weight of what she has absorbed.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The painter’s interiority is richly embodied—her listening “with the hollow between her ribs” and the tactile return of the heartbeat—but the absence of on-page contradiction or visible cost in her final renunciation keeps her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is rich—her “operatively gentle” cadence and the embodied cost of “burying too many compromises” anchor her arc. The final palm-press seals a credible renunciation with felt cost. Secondary characters remain silhouettes, but the single-POV focus justifies this. No unmotivated epiphanies or therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs empire—are dramatized in the salt-crusted kneel and the whispered mating call; the final release carries a palpable forfeiture of his usual control, earning the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtesan's interiority is richly embodied—her breath as "stanza resisting silence" and her refusal of the Court’s lullaby are concrete micro-choices. Motivation (resonance over vengeance) remains consistent and escalates to the final whispered "I remember you," which visibly dissolves the knot. The cost is felt in her bare feet leaving no prints—an earned stasis that forecloses return. Minor: the "bodily poetic" label edges toward abstraction rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the calligrapher’s shift from aesthetic evasion to accountability is dramatized through the puppet-self and candle-lit rehearsal. Motive intensifies cleanly from past guilt to present resolve, culminating in the earned serenity that costs him his former detachment. Minor slip: Mira remains off-page, so relationship crucible is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lyrical yet concrete; the “transiently rooted” paradox is embodied in every micro-choice (bowing without touching the monarch). Motive—honoring overlooked histories—drives the ritual, and the final renunciation (leaving the shrine to dissolve) carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only serene acceptance, so the arc is more stance than struggle. Still, the character feels irreducibly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caster’s interiority is rich, embodied, and consistent; “technically gentle” is lived through wax-work and rope-handling. Motivation (preserve forgotten names) drives every beat; the final renunciation—leaving the helix unsigned—costs ego and is earned. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only recollected ones, keeping this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “precisely playful” trait is dramatized in micro-choices (avoiding alarms, the dance-step descent). Contradictory impulses—fear vs. surrender—coexist in real time. The final renunciation (walking deeper, not out) is earned by prior dream logic and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and specific—his “frugal” trait is embodied in selling his cloak for lamp oil and eating barley cakes. Contradictory impulses (rationalist vs devotee) coexist in scene, culminating in the tremor of recognition that costs him comfort. The final renunciation—no fame, only the tile’s quiet charge—earns its cost through prior causal chain. Minor slip: “empirically ironic” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the pacifist’s motives (avoid bloodshed via cunning) drive every micro-choice. Contradictory impulses—rage vs pacifism—co-exist in the same beats. The final renunciation (melody migrates inward) is earned by prior embodied memory work and carries visible cost: the pin stays broken, the box is left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirror maker’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused hands, breath-counting, memory of childhood dream—but the final choice to absorb the dream lacks a visible cost that alters her stance; she ends cradling the mirror with no felt forfeiture or change in self-definition.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mender’s contradictory impulses—shame, defiance, tenderness—are alive in every tactile choice (honeyed spoon, ribbon stitch). Her interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The final micro-choice (climb again with honey/thread/hope) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she accepts perpetual uncertainty rather than forced forgiveness. Daughter remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is implied, not dramatized—cap stays just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“humming in her bones”), but the decisive shift from bewilderment to awakening is compressed into a single beat; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interiority is precise: her “botanical diary of semantic blooms” viscerally links language and botany, each micro-choice to lay a hand on Kael and rewrite “rescue” crystallizes her core identity under pressure. Her flaws (naïve archival optimism) quietly compound into the final renegotiation; cost registers in the closing image’s new petals pressing themselves “between pages.” Relationship stakes feel lived-in despite minimal dialogue; their exchanged lines hold distinct, textured speech patterns. Voice remains singular across POV, syntax mirrors a linguist’s mind, never drifting into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    The chimera twin’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (“I am both / and neither / and all”) crystallize in the final beat with felt cost. The choice to accept fracture rather than wholeness is earned by prior causality and the garden’s stakes. Minor slip: the “blissfully aberrant” label is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; the archivist’s “quiet thrill” and patient finger-work show contradictory calm under anomaly pressure. Motivation—translate confusion into clarity—drives every micro-choice and is paid for when the door vanishes, foreclosing further access. No stock labels; even the smile is faint, costed. The only limit: we never feel her body fatigue or risk, so the price stays conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ripple-mark’s interiority is precise—her bare feet “reading the cave floor like braille” and her refusal to flee but to “find the quiet” give motive force. The echo-chamber stone as extension of will shows embodied choice under pressure. Final renunciation—she “stepped back,” work done—earns stasis with visible cost: the stone surrendered, her map-skin now guiding her deeper alone.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“thistle-blown hope”); micro-choices (prism angle, chalk marks) reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation intensifies from passive listening to active conduit. Final renunciation of “wandering” for “summoned” carries felt cost. No contradictory impulses in scene, so 9+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Archivist’s interiority is vivid—her “preemptively nostalgic” ache is embodied in every gesture—but the piece withholds a decisive micro-choice that would crystallize cost; she measures shadows with empathy yet never alters her path, so the arc remains observational rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s embodied, contradiction-laden interiority is vivid; the kerosene rag knot and mosaic sequence externalize her wager against despair. Motivation intensifies from chant to dance, culminating in the renunciation of the rag—cost paid on the page. One character, one crucible; no relationship pressure needed.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the chronicler’s tactile attention to tide and cicada reveals her stance. The final shared silence crystallizes a micro-choice—presence over resolution—earning cost without tidy epiphany. Motivation (“texture of time”) remains abstract, slightly blunting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The child’s claustrophobia is embodied in trembling ribs and the doll-anchor; interior contradiction (hunger for silence vs. fear of it) drives every beat. Micro-choices—whispering to the doll, climbing upward, letting go—escalate stakes and foreclose return. The final renunciation (falling sideways, not back) is earned by prior longing and costs the safety of walls. Only slight abstraction in “tasted of thunderstorms” keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Gondola operator’s interior logic is vivid: “to teach silence how to comfort” drives every micro-tilt of the gondola and calibrated exhale. He earns the passenger’s release through embodied empathy without speech. Flaw: motivation is stated twice, once as label, once as dramatized cost. Still, his renunciation of words in favor of vibration is credible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“boots whispered against echoes”), but the final ascension choice is stated rather than dramatized with bodily cost; the flake’s hum is the only externalized emotion. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene—she never hesitates or regrets—so the arc feels pre-decided. Still, the micro-choice to sit on a throne of “unsent letters” is specific and character-revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The keeper’s contradictory impulses—yearning to heal yet refusing contact—pulse in every beat; the final renunciation (“stop fighting the shape of your own throat”) is earned by the scar-threading ritual and costs her the sanctuary itself. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the mission’s external stakes remain abstract; the cost is felt but not clearly scaled to anyone beyond the self.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s survivor guilt and hunger for redemption are embodied in tactile choices—coaxing mycelium, clutching the bolt, pressing it into the seam. Contradictory impulses (spite vs. belief) coexist in the same beats, culminating in an earned renunciation of the old hustler self. The final smile and “extra bolts” text crystallize a new identity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is richly embodied (“bones as tuning forks, lungs as bellows”), but the final reversal hinges on an external recording rather than an interior choice; cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The knight’s interior contradiction—stoic silence vs. yearning for possibility—is embodied in every micro-choice; the unsnapping sequence dramatizes surrender with visible bodily cost. Motivation remains rooted in murmured allegiance, intensifying as the stakes shift from isolation to conduit. The final laughter crystallizes earned change, foreclosing withdrawal with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “quiet companion folded between folders”), but the decisive shift from cataloguing loss to “magnifying small kindnesses” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully enacted in a visible micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s understated competence and embodied memory anchor every beat; her “carefully resourceful” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tweezers, dynamo, key). Interiority stays concrete, but the final vanish feels slightly unearned—no visible cost or flaw exposed—so the renunciation lands just shy of full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical yet grounded in embodied grief; the saxophonist’s micro-choices (softened embouchure, letting notes dissolve) foreclose fame and forestall prophecy with felt cost. Motivation is consistent and intensifies through the final breath. The absence of secondary characters limits relationship crucible, but single-POV depth compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s interiority is sensory and precise—ledger, fern-tip stylus, mossy delight—but her decisive pivot (from observer to tuner) leans on a soft beat: moonstone-thread hum rather than an action that visibly costs or reconfigures her path; the transformation reads more conferred than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drive—fixing clocks to understand failure—anchors every beat; the final renunciation of his father’s watch crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“hands stained with oil and regret”), yet the admiral remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choices (tracing grooves, tossing the watch) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Flawed obsession complicates choices to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—pride in balance vs. guilt over withheld mercy—is embodied in the ritual handling of the coin and crucible; her micro-choices (naming the dead aloud, leaning closer to the breaking coin) escalate the cost. The shift from “Elara the Even” to “Elara the Mended” is earned by the causal chain of naming and fracture. No stock phrasing; regret is rendered as “a stone beneath her ribs.” Flaws complicate choices and remain unresolved except in the costly transformation of the coin.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Collector’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to harmonize rather than banish crystallizes her arc. Croc-tooth and flute act as extensions of motive, not props. Final “luminous ache” shows earned cost without tidy redemption. No secondary on-page characters, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—pain as “geometry of suffering,” knees locking at shadows. The micro-choice to release the strap is earned and costly. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Flawed endurance reads credible; final renunciation carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The translator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“soles remembering rope burns”), motives escalate from personal validation to client healing, and the final micro-choice—handing over the lens—carries visible cost (loss of the memory-scent). One hairline slip: the historian’s on-page reaction is reported rather than dramatized, blunting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The technician’s motivation—discovery rather than repair—drives every micro-choice; embodied emotion (“brushed dust from his knees”) and the final whispered “I see you” crystallize a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interior contradiction is subtle but present: his professional detachment versus paternal empathy. The pearl button and child’s drawing function as charged objects that tilt his stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrical but thin; the operator’s contradictory impulses (order vs rupture) are stated rather than embodied. The final choice to compress eternity is foreshadowed yet lacks a micro-choice that dramatizes the cost to her personally. Still, her silence and ink-stained fingers recur as concrete signatures, and the Earned Stasis—accepting a “beautifully broken” library—carries felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The revolutionary’s shift from militant to translator is embodied in tactile micro-choices—fingering the shard, covering mirrors—each charged with visible cost; his contradictory impulses (restore vs. reimagine) coexist in scene, not summary. The final renunciation of triumph for translation is earned by prior causality and carries felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—hands trembling, stone pulsing against his chest—but the pivotal guilt flashback is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the micro-choice that links past lie to present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s eccentricity is shown through tactile choices—tasting lagoon water, leaving the compass—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract self-analysis (“rewrites her sense of scale”) that softens contradiction. The final renunciation is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive to “scaffold complexity with simplicity” is dramatized through her carving choices under storm pressure; her interiority is salted with sensory specificity and micro-choices that reconfigure her stance. The final renunciation—leaving the sculpture to become communal—earns its cost by the prior accumulation of tactile labor and ancestral trust. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority is vivid and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“fingers tracing brittle edges,” “stained with pigment and pollen”), motives clear, and the final renunciation of explanation carries felt cost. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“gnawing need to reckon”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her salt-stung knees, the diary’s weight on her sternum—but the final surrender to “living ledger” status feels slightly abstract; the cost is legible yet not fully dramatized in a single micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alchemist’s interiority is vivid—his refusal of nostalgia and embrace of reinvention are embodied in nightly bottle rituals and street offerings. Contradictory impulses (grief vs creation) play out in micro-choices (handing the bottle to the child). Final stance crystallizes in communal “participation” rather than leadership—earned renunciation with felt cost of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s shift from passive archivist to active “awakener” is embodied in micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, scattering petals) and carries visible cost—her trembling fingers, the orchard’s invasive warmth. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic, and the contradiction between preservation and release is held in scene. The prophecy’s sting feels earned because it springs from her own child-voice. One minor slip: the “curse” label is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“vibrating at the frequency where rage and peace fuse”), her contradictory impulses act in-scene, and the final renunciation (decreasing entropy by letting go) is earned with visible cost. The heirloom-seed-saver vocation is more label than lived craft, slightly flattening her specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tester’s quiet, methodical interiority is vivid—her refusal to trust sirens, her tactile calibration of the rope, her embodied patience all feel lived-in. Yet the arc is more stance crystallization than change; the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the janitor’s shift from cataloger to witness is credibly rooted in prior trauma. The final tearful recognition is earned by the comet’s efflorescence and his sustained micro-choice to keep sweeping. One hairline slip: “called it awakening” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tranquil perception and refusal-to-open crystallize a quiet renunciation; sustained embodiment (kneeling, tracing glass) reveals hierarchy of duty over self. Interiority avoids therapeutic label-speak while sustaining contradictory impulse: serve covenant yet ache for release. Ghost gaze beats (“met her gaze... with gratitude”) validate keeper’s stance—cost paid in eternal charge, not dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vey’s shift from bureaucrat to curator of echoes is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing glyphs, pressing urn fragments—so the renunciation of “counting seconds” carries felt cost. Interior contradiction pulses when their heart restarts only after the urn’s chime, making the final stance earned. Lira’s presence is brief but sufficient to refract Vey’s grief and curiosity, turning the silo into a crucible of shared memory.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is lyrically embodied and consistent; the feather-as-compass anchors her choices without overt exposition. The micro-choice to weave the kite rather than “fix” it crystallizes her values under pressure. Minor: the boy’s interiority is sketched more generically, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s terminal diagnosis and “brazen calm” are embodied in every copper twist; the diary sketches and sparrow rescue dramatize his motive without exposition. Interiority stays tactile—salt-softened leather, tremor-free fingers—yet the flaw (denial of decay) never blocks his agency. Final renunciation—binding the diary to the branch—earns its cost in breath and legacy. Minor slip: villagers remain off-page silhouettes, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“boots sinking slightly into mossy earth,” “scent of petrichor thick”), but the decisive shift from data-seeker to participant is slightly under-dramatized—more stated than enacted in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Coachman’s quiet, embodied resolve—cracked hands, seed-weight, throat-listening—grounds his arc; the renunciation of speed for sprout-time crystallizes with felt cost. Interior contradiction (memory vs mercy) is present but lightly dramatized; a single micro-choice (heel-crush of pods) carries the turn. Voice stays individual, never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bracken’s shift from corpse-hunter to voice-archivist is embodied in tactile choices—placing the leaf against sun, cranking the dynamo, matching cylinder to listener—each micro-choice visibly priced by trembling paws and glowing wax. Interior contradiction pulses: he keeps the leaf “not for memory’s sake” yet dreams of forests, a tension that compounds until the final hush. The earned renunciation—no longer hunting death but resurrecting presence—lands with felt communal cost as the settlement’s nights restructure around loss and echo.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the compass rose warms against her chest, the pencil stroke “stitches time.” Contradictory impulses—stay/leave, record/accept—co-exist in scene. The final renunciation (closing the book, turning away) carries visible cost: she forfeits re-entry to “normalcy.” Only minor slip: the grandmother’s aphorism drifts toward label-speak, blunting edge.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elric’s contradictory impulses are rendered in lyrical, embodied detail (“apprentice of wonder” against the physical slog up the spire). The internal shift from conquest to surrender is foreshadowed and paid—“heart drumming a rhythm older than kingdoms”, then kneels in reverence—yet a slight summary gloss on learning chess language flattens immediacy by half a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise—“tilt of a head before grief” anchors motive in embodied detail. The crisis-actor-to-survivor arc is credible because the erosion of pretense is dramatized through walking the word-patterns. The final refusal to bow crystallizes a cost (social credit, identity) earned by prior choices. One hairline slip: “I realized then” edges toward summary epiphany, not embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the seer's contradictory longing to bury her own talent while having spent decades resurrecting others' is dramatized through the tactile ritual with feather and stone. The final kneeling beat crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost—she gives up the translator role to inhabit the home she once only read for others.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers fidgeted productively,” “trembled—not from fear, but from recognition”), and the final stance is earned by the prior winnowing. The only minor drag is the backstory paragraph, which slightly dilutes present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Artist’s contradictory impulses—mischief vs. scalpel-like intent—are embodied in every micro-choice (swapping grave markers, singing the child’s tremble). Final renunciation of a unified truth is earned by prior refractions and carries visible cost: the spire dissolves, mist of grief released. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. One slip: “guilt too large for their small frame” drifts toward label.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the kintsugi metaphor binds memory to action. The final renunciation (“the version of me I abandoned”) lands with felt cost. Minor drift: “weight of kintsugi intentions” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the painter’s contradictory impulses (to return vs. to leave the shell) crystallize in the cave. The final renunciation—leaving the shell—earns its cost through prior beats. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Motive remains consistent and intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the blistered fingers, shallow breath, and the vow “carved into her ribs” ground motive. Micro-choice—pressing the cork to her lips—drives the climax with visible cost (knees buckling, cork warm). Flaw: no contradictory impulse in-scene; intent is monolithic, not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The navigator’s moon-phase physiology is embodied (joints stiffen, thoughts sharpen) and directly constrains her midnight calls; her choice to “wait, listen, build” under waning moon shows earned restraint with visible cost—she once walked into static and still bears ringing ears. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; her tactile ritual with the censer foot anchors motive and memory. The final stance—singing coordinates into wind—crystallizes her values without tidy resolution. Minor: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the forager’s contradictory need to speak truth yet shield others charges every beat. Micro-choices—kneeling to the soil, placing the eye—reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of the relic crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Minor: the three newcomers remain functional rather than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the Edelweiss acts as a charged object that tilts his stance. The final renunciation—keeping the truth from the sea—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “softly persistent” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—solitude vs. the vow to his sister—are embodied in his tactile handling of maps and the chip; the final step through the arch costs his lifelong refuge, earned by the sister-memory that has silently steered every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid—her bare feet remembering palace marble, the apology in each step—but the “softly commanding” trait is asserted more than embodied; the climactic choice to descend as “witness” feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete micro-choice that dramatizes the cost of that renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. betrayal) coexist in the same breath. Elias’s guilt is dramatized through tremor and soot-streaked tears, not labels. The final choice—to alchemize guilt into pigment—earns its cost via the columella’s heat and the nexus’s amber sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the jealousy of past selves is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (reaching for the scroll, strumming the chord). The final renunciation—accepting ragged seams—earns its cost via prior feral nostalgia and ink-stained struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—aromatherapist without smell—grounds every beat; her micro-choice to offer the clock to the pregnant couple crystallizes her new stance with visible cost. Ren’s status as mentor is cleanly legible, but his dialogue drifts into sage aphorism (“broken clocks still hold time”) that slightly flattens status tension. The final renunciation of scented identity is earned through tactile, auditory mapping shown in scene. Voice convergence under stress is minor but keeps this just outside 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (fear vs. surrender) play simultaneously in scene. The micro-choice to hum the lullaby under stress crystallizes her arc and earns the final shift from shame to story. Scars as waypoints is a fresh, non-generic reconfiguration. Only a hairline slip: the “story” epiphany edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembled,” “voice rough as torn sheet music”), but the apology’s motivation is asserted more than dramatized; the micro-choice to wire the perfume bottle is specific and costly, earning the rapprochement.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and specific—e.g., “she absorbed them without judgment”—but the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible. Motivation (clarity over salvation) is consistent and intensifies toward surrender. The final renunciation is earned, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the shepherd’s refusal to accept standard time is dramatized through tactile key-turning and backward counting. Contradictory impulses—reverence vs. rebellion—coexist in the same beats. Final renunciation (leaving pistons dormant) carries visible cost: tomorrow he must repeat the ritual alone. Only minor slip: “eminently peculiar” is asserted rather than proven by action.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the laser button while seeking release—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing, thumbing, offering). The final renunciation is earned by the prior spatial attunement beats and carries visible cost in the dissolution of the familiar stranger. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock therapy-speak intrudes. Only the absence of on-page secondary character pressure keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—flunking calculus to watch her mother’s face, then redefining risk after her father’s collapse—are embodied and specific. The interiority is character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak. The final micro-choice of writing “Begin again” in green ink crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost. Only the father’s brief appearance lacks full crucible pressure, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Operator’s interiority is concrete—thumb on disc, misrouting as ritual—yet her contradictory impulse (self-looped call) arrives as summary, not dramatized choice, softening the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist’s interiority is precise and embodied; her micro-choices (brushing planks, opening locket, dipping pen) reveal motive and cost. The contradiction between grief and reverence is dramatized in the moment, not summarized. The final smile carries earned renunciation—she forecloses mourning in favor of witness, paying with perpetual labor.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory mix of jocular façade and raw need for connection is embodied in every beat; the final reciprocity scene crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Secondary characters remain sketches, but the widower’s trembling hand and the runaway’s silence exert pressure that forces her micro-choice. Interiority is specific and embodied; no therapy-speak intrudes. The earned warmth in the closing image forecloses her prior isolation without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensorially rich and embodied; the absorption of languages through skin is dramatized in each beat. The final renunciation—leaving the ring—earns its cost because every prior step was guided by its pull. Yet the arc tilts toward epiphany rather than contradiction, missing a deeper internal clash.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory (“confidently uncertain”); the pen’s inheritance and the mentor’s vanishing anchor motive; micro-choice to “unbend” syntax is dramatized; final renunciation carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—creating beauty that must vanish—drives every micro-choice; the mute girl’s trembling hands crystallize the cost. Silas’s whispered counsel deepens rather than directs, keeping agency with Elara. The final renunciation (no archive, only felt echo) is earned and painful.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is visceral and embodied (“volcanic tenderness,” “cracked amphorae”); the arsonist past is not just backstory but a flaw that drives the present mission and the final choice to become “destroyer and savior.” Contradictory impulses—guilt, awe, ancestral duty—co-exist in the same beats, culminating in an earned renunciation of her fugitive identity. The cost is felt in the closing smile that accepts perpetual exile above ground.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—drumming on shins, ribs, air—showing contradictory impulses (surrender vs. rebellion) in real time. The shift from passive survivor to active weaver is earned through micro-choices that accumulate cost: each percussive beat rejects the garden’s sedation and invites the entangled to co-author the dream. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“loneliness would multiply inside her like cells in a petri dish”) that momentarily flattens the visceral into the clinical.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s gait-reading skill is embodied in every step and choice; the coin’s weight and the map’s folds force her into a quiet, costly decision that aligns with her whisper-over-shout ethic. Interiority is precise and sensory, never diagnostic. The final act of slipping evidence to Ruiz crystallizes her values with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and consistent; the guardian’s contradictory impulses (silence vs. action) play out in tactile micro-choices. Motivation is rooted in memory of the boy and crystallizes in the final renunciation—her refusal to speak or intervene beyond light-weaving carries visible cost. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV depth is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingertips brushing,” “cradled…like a sleeping child”), but the story leans on lyrical summary rather than micro-choices under rising pressure; the final beat is more image than decision, so the cost feels diffuse rather than personally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s embodied contradictions (grace vs callouses, skeptic vs listener) are vivid; the scrimshaw’s warmth and dissolution force a visible cost. Interiority is concrete, though the final shift to “mend souls” edges toward summary. Motivation arc is earned under Accumulative lens. One slip: “tenderness sharpened by the combative edge” is label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“voice flat as parchment”), but the performer’s final compliance feels slightly under-motivated—no interior contradiction surfaces in the station scene to justify the seamless pivot. The micro-choice of sealing the bouquet in pine carries cost, yet the emotional void remains more asserted than dramatized. Still, the character’s flaws (performative grief, strategic hollowness) consistently shape tactics, earning a strong mid-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—“tremor of certainty” and “seed cracking stone” anchor motive—but the poet’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure shows how awe scorches palms. The final dance is a bodily enactment of motive, yet the cost is lyrical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s color-blind synesthesia and Marta’s shift from merchant to student are embodied through tactile choices; the “bartered awakenings” ethic forces micro-choices that reconfigure their relationship. Interior contradictions (salvage vs spectacle) play out in plant placements and the kiln promise, earning the final stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the miner’s lens and the act of singing reveal contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet choosing solitude in the lab. The final renunciation (she leaves with the lens glowing, not with people) is earned by the prior accumulation of sensory memory. Flaw: no second character on page, so relationship crucible is absent; this caps the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is specific—"grief scraped her soul to marrow"—and embodied in tactile acts like burnishing coordinates with her thumb. Motive is consistent: reroute sorrow, not erase it. The final renunciation (leaving the locket unclaimed) is earned by the pattern of prior releases. Minor: no contradictory impulses shown in scene; emotion is steady rather than volatile.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the cartomancer’s curiosity is dramatized through tactile ritual. Yet no internal contradiction or visible cost charges the final beat—her stance merely crystallizes. Secondary pressure from the visitor is too brief to test her values.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the historian’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs. annihilate memory) play out in micro-choices like the off-key humming. The loss-of-child backstory is anchored to present action and tilts her stance. Final renunciation of nostalgia’s hold is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s vigil is vivid and embodied; the river stone anchors her tactile memory. Interior contradiction—hope vs. archival detachment—surfaces in micro-choices (embedding the stone). The final renunciation (watching, not halting change) carries cost, though the moment of decision is compressed into one lyrical beat rather than dramatized under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction (to walk or to stay) is palpable in every micro-choice and in her hands reconstructing the tail; the final stance crystallises with a visible cost in her resignation and testimony plan. One small waver: the shift from ‘self-respect vs compassion’ to ‘vigilance over naïveté’ reads slightly epiphanic rather than earned in immediate scene moment and pulls back from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—reading scars vs. sealing them—surface in embodied micro-choices (touching scar, kneeling to seed). Interiority is concrete; the final renunciation of “closure seeker” is earned by the seed’s dissolution and felt cost. Minor: the telepathy trait is asserted more than dramatized in choices.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the gazer’s recognition of her own unmailed letters crystallizes her motive. Yet the decisive act—gathering the letters to mail—feels slightly under-motivated against her established role as witness rather than courier, blurring the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears froze on her cheeks”), but the arc leans on thematic exposition rather than a decisive micro-choice; the final surrender is felt yet not a clear renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guard’s dreamlessness and mission are vividly embodied; his micro-choice to “charm” the sphere crystallizes motive and cost. Interiority is concrete, but the absence of contradictory impulse under pressure keeps him just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the philosopher’s contradictory impulses (yearning vs. resignation) play out in tactile micro-choices—dipping the gear, humming with bones. Motivation remains lucid and intensifies to the final step. The earned renunciation at the Edge carries visible conceptual cost. Minor: the gear’s emotional valence is slightly abstract, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira and Torvin embody “gently persistent” through tactile micro-choices (moss-touching, ear-to-bark listening), but the collective “guides” remain archetypal; no single interior contradiction is dramatized under pressure, and the final renunciation is felt more as choral ethos than individual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bellhop’s contradictory impulses—protective silence vs. thawing hope—are embodied in trembling hands and the bolt’s concealment/return. His final seated choice crystallizes a value hierarchy with visible cost: the fortress’s first audible note. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the bolt and stain act as externalized stakes. Only a hairline slip: the grandmother’s whispered assurance feels slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The titan’s exile, patience, and refusal of the crown are embodied through tactile micro-choices (ink pellet, marginalia, final renunciation). Interior contradiction—grief versus duty—surfaces in the hollow echo of justice. The earned renunciation carries visible cost: she leaves the throne and her people’s adoration. Minor slip: “regally unpretentious” is label-adjacent, though later actions redeem it.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s tactile obsession and grief-born curiosity feel lived-in; the 17-second lag turns her private ritual into plot-causality. Interiority stays concrete—salt-crusted knuckles, fused journal pages—never sliding into label-speak. The final descent is earned because her body has been listening longer than her mind. Cost is visible: she surfaces “salt-crusted and silent,” renouncing the old search for a submerged covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The barefoot stargazer is richly embodied through trembling fingers, bare soles, hushed aria—“micro-choice” on page is her knelt palm-press syncing heartbeat to stone. Contradictory impulses (awkward confidence vs trembling) stay active in scene, not summary. Cost is the hollow unmoored by treaty-silence, crystallized when she seeds a new frequency with an aria whisper. Closure is earned because the listening choice is the culminating beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The insurgent grandmother’s motives (evolving tradition, refusal of silence) are clear and embodied; her final “Choose” is a credible renunciation of control that costs her sole guardianship of destiny. Interiority is textured (“knuckles…gnarled from decades of weaving resistance”) and her telepathy is shown constraining choice (vines answer, guide her). Flaw: no contradictory impulse on the page—risk feels one-note. Still, the earned cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (phantom twinges, soles registering texture), but the decisive shift from anchor to compass feels slightly under-motivated; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene to earn the pearl’s crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation ("descend into necessary darkness") anchors interiority, but agency stays diffuse—no concrete micro-choice after stitching. Embodied ache ("luminescent ache of transformation") earns body cost, yet the portraitist’s portrait remains interior; no externalized flaw compounds the mistake. Relationship crucible absent (second character never joins). Earned stasis reads as resignation rather than active foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tracker’s interiority is vivid—“quiet, molten fury”—but the final disappearance risks unearned epiphany; cost (vanishing body) is legible yet motivation for total self-erasure remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“duty demanded suppression, conscience demanded detonation”—and the final calm refusal costs her freedom, yet the emotional turn from trembling to serene feels slightly accelerated; one more embodied beat of hesitation at the Resonance Table would lock the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifist stance and embodied micro-choices (sheathing the knife, gifting cuttings) are vivid and consistent; the final beat with the child crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, but the “senselessly perceptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized in scene. Relationships remain off-stage, so status crucible is N/A. Closure choice is earned and renunciatory.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and consistent; the fisher’s transliterating trait and cool-headed stance manifest in micro-choices (shaping silence, matching feral pitch). Motivation—catching the goddess’s echo—drives every beat. Final renunciation (carrying, not capturing) is earned and carries felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and character-specific; the pen nib, telescope, and smoke ritual all externalize a lifelong vocation of “reading margins.” The final micro-choice—emailing the folio—pays off her grandfather’s creed with visible cost (exposure risk). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t quite cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the protagonist’s contradictory drive to both silence and confront guilt is dramatized through micro-choices (pressing her own arm to the amber, writing the letter). The final renunciation—accepting static as lullaby—earns its cost from prior failures. Minor drift: the grandmother backstory is summary rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“lilac unease settling into her bones”), yet the decisive change—her smile at the tile’s fracture—arrives with earned cost. Motivations remain consistent: her need to “listen more than draw” drives every micro-choice. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“socially perceptive nature had always let her read crowds…”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the bite of the tessera, the micro-choice to press it into the magistrate’s palm all embody her contradiction between mercy and justice. The “retrocognitively trapped” trait is dramatized through embodied action, not label. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts the past walking beside her, foreclosing denial.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ghost’s yearning for encore and refusal to fade is vividly embodied; her final choice to release herself into the orchard’s sapling carries visible cost. Interiority is synesthetic and specific, but the absence of contradictory impulse in-scene keeps it from 9+. Motivation is coherent and escalates to the climactic renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s embodied interiority is precise and character-specific; the somatic mapping of tremors and pulse spikes grounds her arc. The final choice—to open the studio and invite others—carries visible cost (loss of solitude, risk of exposure) and is earned by the preceding bodily trial. Minor slack: Mateo’s voice is heard but not fully dramatized as external pressure, so relationship crucible is partial.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—her calibration ritual with the fossil, the sync of pulse and tide—but the absence of any second character or relationship crucible keeps the score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the hourglass turner's tactile rituals and micro-choices (spiraling buttons, slow turn of glass) reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation—“prophecy into raw possibility”—drives every beat and crystallizes in the final distribution of jars. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV arc is coherent and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—burned spy seeking redemption vs. gardener of justice—are embodied in the trembling hand that both hides and plants the microfilm. The final renunciation of retrieval for legacy is earned by the prior causal chain of betrayal and the embodied cost of her burns. Interiority is concrete and specific; no stock phrases intrude. One slip: the phrase “ghost of justice” edges toward abstraction rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interiority is richly embodied—“bones grown roots into the rhythm of road and weather”—and his micro-choice to offer the needle crystallizes his arc. The palimpsest promise threads motive through memory and present action, though the passenger remains a cipher, muting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The potter’s quiet, unyielding motivation is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling, tracing, pouring water—yet her interiority remains slightly abstract; the final refusal to fire the kiln crystallizes her arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“smoke in her lungs and silence in her throat”), but the brother-fire backstory is delivered in one reflective block that slightly flattens pressure. Micro-choices (angling prisms, tucking the tooth) align with motives and show earned renunciation. No contradictory impulses in scene; cost is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s layered memory and atomic skin are embodied in concrete micro-choices (pressing palms to brass, flaring cobalt), but the interior contradiction between mourning and midwifery is more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final smile feels slightly unearned given the prior weight of extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s interiority is lyrical but thin; the “frayed soul” is asserted rather than embodied. His single decisive act—dissolving into the temple—earns resonance because the spiral and origami birds externalize the cost. Yet we never feel the tug between his longing and his fear of vanishing; the choice reads inevitable rather than struggled-over.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is precise—her “quiet grit” and “ethereal grit” refrains crystallize her stance. The micro-choice to thread counter-frequencies at 2:17 a.m. is embodied and costly (lost sleep, isolation). Flaws (overconfidence in pattern-recognition) drive the risk she takes. Closure shows earned endurance: she stays in the booth, accepting perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in trembling fingers, shallow breath, and the mantra of coordinates; the compass needle pointing at her own chest crystallizes her interior contradiction and earns the final renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s face-blindness and tactile memory are vividly embodied; her decision to “remember them properly” crystallizes the arc. The hooded man’s grief is textured through salt-stiff collar and tremor, but his late arrival limits relationship crucible. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final renunciation—sketching the killer faceless—earns its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—idealism against fear, exile against legacy—are embodied in trembling fingers and the warming nail; her final choice to sing the storm into mercy is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (exile becomes irreversible pilgrimage). Interiority is concrete and character-specific, though a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “nervously confident” slightly dilutes the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fiddler’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“bow trembling in his dynamically observant hands”), but the decisive shift—choosing to step into the amnesty rather than chase the hitchhiker—relies more on lyric assertion than on dramatized micro-choices; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the protagonist’s contradictory impulses (escape vs. reroute) are dramatized in micro-choices like chalk arrows and ribbon ties. The final renunciation of “running” is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost in the loss of the startup. No stock phrasing; voice remains character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“ink-stained fingers tracing constellations that pulsed like living veins”), motivation rooted in quiet redemption is consistent, and the final renunciation—accepting the burden-chain—earns its cost. The only minor drag is that the guardian’s dialogue slips into explanatory mode, slightly diluting the micro-choice moment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the druid’s contradictory impulses (fear of revelation vs hunger for truth) act simultaneously. The final unbending is earned through the seed’s slow invasion and her micro-choice to breathe, not scream. Flaw: the “mirrors lie” epiphany is slightly abstract; a more visceral cue would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    The visionary’s motivations are interior and contradictory—scars as both wounds and conduits, loyalty to forgotten vows—yet they play out in physically fused choice. The moment the roots anchor her soles and the clipping sinks, embodied cost is legible on the page. Relationships stay subtextual; no status dynamics risk clarity because she is alone on stage. Earned Stasis lands clean: acceptance of fusion is renunciation of flight, priced in pain.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands, barefoot resolve, the Hanged Man as lodestar—yet Kael’s “cloak stitched from funeral shrouds and spite” edges caricature. Their clash crystallizes a credible shift: Kael’s grip loosens from surrender to seedling. The cost is felt when roots shackle him and resin seals the card. One more beat of Kael’s private contradiction would push this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jasper’s contradictory impulses—mechanical cataloguing vs. the ache for music—are dramatized in concrete beats (cloth to ear, laptop rename). The final shift from insulation to listening is earned by prior micro-choices and carries felt cost: he pockets the cloth next to heartbeat, not toolkit. Interiority stays specific to his sensory bias; no diagnostic labels. Slight reserve: Ruiz functions more as thematic echo than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse syncing with the arbor’s thrum, her smile at the seed’s split—but the “three dissertations” backstory is delivered in summary, not dramatized micro-choice, slightly blunting the cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Librarian’s moon-phase trait and interior contradiction (full-moon clarity vs new-moon doubt) are dramatized through micro-choices—lowering the creel, shelving it under “Waning Wonder.” The cost is soft (waning certainty) but felt; the arc is a credible renunciation of absolute truth rather than a change of heart.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the inspector’s contradictory impulses (duty vs. longing) play out in micro-choices like pressing the pearl into the shell. The final renunciation—becoming conduit rather than owner—earns its cost through prior confessions. Minor slip: “envied the dead their release” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chronicler’s guilt, methodical grief, and micro-choices (playing the accordion, mapping, pressing palm to graffiti) all track. Motivation to self-forgive is clear, but the sister-abandonment backstory is delivered in one expository lump rather than dramatized choice, muting the cost scale.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—healing vs. complicity—are embodied in trembling fingers and telepathic communion with plants; the final renunciation (letting the violin melt into seeds) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost as the Chancellor’s authority literally sprouts around his boots.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mortician’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, reverent breaths—but the scholar remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses surface in-scene, and the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned under fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied; the hairpin’s reinsertion crystallizes a credible shift from caretaker to self-reclaimer. The forgiveness beat is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost of that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses (sell certainty vs. doubt) are embodied in the cloak’s weight and the shard’s tremor; the unhooking choice is earned by prior interior struggle and carries visible cost (exposure, loss of client-ready armor). Interiority is concrete, but the “conscience for hire” label is slightly expository rather than dramatized in speech or action.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—her grief over lost colleagues and lovers versus her refusal to vanish herself—are embodied in her trembling hands and withheld explanations. The micro-choice to let Kael believe he’s only learning meditation crystallizes her hierarchy of values: revelation over comfort. Her backward-aging flaw is not merely cosmetic; it fuels her urgency to pass on knowledge before she loses the memory of loss. The final renunciation—she withholds the last step—earns its cost through every prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skimmer’s stillness-as-stance is embodied and specific; the arrowhead’s grooves-as-prayers anchor interiority without exposition. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. Micro-choices are implied rather than shown, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s refusal to automate magic and his tactile bond with the keystone are vivid and embodied; the interior contradiction between failure and wonder is dramatized in the mist-walk beat. The final renunciation—abandoning grandeur for small imperfect charms—earns its cost through prior beats. Minor slip: the “folded light” figure speaks in gentle exposition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical yet anchored in embodied action; the lamplighter’s contradictory drive—to witness silence yet chase color—presses every beat. His micro-choice to dive without hesitation crystallizes motive into irrevocable cost. The ledger’s revelation of a pre-written vow lands as earned stasis: he accepts the price of drowning for knowledge. Only the vanished woman remains a cipher, blurring relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremor in her molars,” “itch behind her eyes”); motivation evolves from surrender to reclaimed agency. The final choice to step forward without drawing lots is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—she foregoes the safety of chance. Minor drift: the child-vision epiphany feels slightly abstract, but the embodied warmth of the static surge compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"echoes clung to his ribs like frost," "hollow between heartbeats"—but the reaper’s moment of crystallizing grief is slightly under-motivated; we sense the ache but not the precise trigger that makes *now* the time to act. The final stance (heart-carrier) is earned by prior refusal to let fear stay faceless.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mage’s interiority is vivid—his “lukewarm” nature embodied in the oven-check reflex—and his patient micro-choices (timing drops, matching pulse) build to a credible renunciation. The flaw of naïveté is dramatized, not labeled, and the final letting-go carries visible cost. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s shift from erasure to witness-archivist is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (whispering biographies, kneeling in mud, setting the table). Interiority stays specific and embodied; the contradiction between mandate and empathy is active in-scene. The final refusal carries visible social cost (supervisor frown, permanent reassignment). One hairline slip: “humanity remembers” is a touch grandiloquent for a man who has spoken only quietly till now.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers “reading braille left by forgotten gods,” the tear blotted beside the levitation formula—but the decisive change (renouncing formula for wonder) is slightly under-motivated; we feel the awe more than the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—grief etched in tactile muscle-memory, guilt embodied in the ruined-village flashback. Motive rings coherent: preserve trust by calibrated silence. One flaw: the village failure, while sharply recalled, is stated retrospectively; a micro-choice within scene would have tightened causality and earned the burden with live weight.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—surrender vs. re-engagement—are embodied in the silent handling of the jar; the final renunciation of ownership is earned by prior interior struggle. Micro-choice of placing palms to glass crystallizes the shift from numbness to presence. The duplicate’s refusal to inherit pain provides external pressure that alters Kael’s stance. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris’s porous receptivity is shown through the immediate planting of the seed and the vow whispered to it, a concrete micro-choice that costs him years of nightly vigil; the interior contradiction between seeking beauty and embracing rot is present but stays summary rather than dramatized in scene, so the final “never meant to flower” renunciation feels conceptually earned yet not viscerally paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—grief is felt in cracked hands and off-key humming. The pull-cord handle functions as a charged object that reveals motive under pressure. A credible renunciation is earned: he chooses to keep singing to absence rather than demand resurrection, paying the cost of perpetual longing. The single flaw is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“he’s learned fragments are enough”), slightly blunting the rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the guardian’s contradictory longing for “warm ink” against its feral vigil is palpable. Micro-choices (licking ice statues, pressing pendant to forehead) crystallize values. The final stance—offering paw instead of growl—earns the shift from exile to emissary with visible cost of perpetual uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elric’s bruised-violet eyes, blood-drop signature, and shard-stirring micro-choices embody the stoically-sensitive contradiction in scene. Interiority stays concrete—equations whispered, pulse timed—never drifting into label-speak. The final refusal of “hope” for “road” is earned by the iterative failure pattern, but the absence of any second character keeps status/relationship bullets idle, capping just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her “teeth tingle,” “boots crunch”—but the final renunciation (packing the coil and walking away) feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost but not the internal contradiction that makes leaving the awakened city inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Deckhand’s cheerful endurance under cosmic stakes is vivid; the interior contradiction (hope vs. vanishing) is embodied in brass-polishing and radio-tuning micro-choices. Motivation crystallizes on-page—“every soul deserved a single, solid world”—and the final renunciation (no cheer, just return to work) carries felt cost. Minor: captain’s reappearance is more emblem than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and embodied; the architect’s calm, pattern-obsessed stance remains coherent under rising pressure. Her micro-choices—thread tension, step over a nonexistent threshold, release of the thread—are visible and costly. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; all conflict is rendered as serene certainty, so the “internal contradiction” criterion is only weakly met. Still, the final renunciation (letting the thread go) is causally earned and forecloses further mapping, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s “balanced curiosity” is shown in her measured classroom presence and the quiet refusal to sentimentalize the anchor link; her interiority is consistent and embodied. The final choice to mount the link as a compass rather than a relic crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Secondary characters are sketched lightly but serve as crucible for her lesson. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tracer’s interiority is embodied in her sensory attunement to “syncopated ache” and her micro-choice to kneel, tune, and extend a steadying hand. Contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. the knowledge that “unanswered echoes fester”—drive every beat. The girl’s vulnerability is rendered through gesture rather than label, and the tracer’s final act of walking her out is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; claustrophobia is shown through shallow breaths and tactile squeeze. Motivation—"to stand by the unremembered"—drives every beat and the final choice to stay until water rises. Micro-choice to place the gold fleck is earned by prior memory and costs her exit margin. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s contradictory state—legally dead yet biologically alive—drives every micro-choice; the porcelain shard as tactile anchor and the heartbeat count as embodied cost keep interiority concrete. Motivation (“fetch wisdom from failure”) is dramatized, not declared, through the defragmentation ritual. Final renunciation of redemption in favor of honoring residue lands as earned stasis with visible sting of shard against palm.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the copper-veined storyteller’s contradictory impulses (feed the diamond vs. preserve meaning) play out in micro-choices under pressure. Her final articulation of the lost tongue is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—her tears and the diamond’s sated dormancy. No stock phrasing; every reaction is filtered through her perceptual signature. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “her motivation was simple, and impossible,” but it is brief and does not undercut the earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—scarf hiding scar, marrow-nested entity—yet her decisive turn (pressing SEND) feels slightly under-motivated; the shift from bitterness to cosmic laughter lands but could carry more embodied cost. Moira’s cryptic guidance supplies pressure, but their relationship remains ornamental rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The violinist’s interiority is vivid—her blistered fingers and aching arm embody cost—yet the grandmother’s vanishing remains an unmotivated cipher, slightly thinning the causality of the locust gift.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and particular; the mailman’s contradictory impulses—stoic obedience vs clandestine mercy—surface in micro-choices (bowing to guards while hiding the storm). The final renunciation (handing over the bottle) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary pressure from Marla is brief but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “silence was his native tongue” is evocative yet not embodied. No contradictory impulses on-page; choices feel fated rather than wrestled. The final smile is earned by accumulated texture, not by a visible cost paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative but abstract; the librarian’s motives (“to reawaken them”) crystallize only at the end. The scarf functions as charged heirloom, yet her decisive step into the tessellation feels slightly under-motivated—more ritual than wrench. Still, embodied emotion (“humming a lullaby composed of logarithms”) and the final renunciation of retrieval for caretaking give a credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-minded librarian’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tilting the palette, brushing light onto vellum—so motive remains legible under pressure. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. The final reunion is earned by decades of on-page effort and carries visible cost: she closes the palette “to savor,” renouncing further pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The locksmith’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; his motives are declared (“to free an idea”) rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The crimson ribbon on his wrist is a concrete micro-choice that shows cost, yet the mirrors’ pleading reflections are observed, not answered, keeping emotional stakes generalized. Still, the final solidarity kneel earns a modest shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied ("salt-in-the-eyelashes kind"); the folklorist’s curiosity is a trait that drives every beat and the final choice. The contradiction between surgical detachment and aching vacancy is dramatized in the moment she smiles at the cost of staying. Motivation is consistent and escalates from observation to deliberate self-sacrifice. The earned stasis—choosing to feed the orchard with her own memories—lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s contradictory impulses—combative tenderness, fear of exile, insistence on grit—are embodied in her backward walk and fingertip annotations. Her mentorship of the cartographer crystallizes her arc: she risks her own exile to force him past despair, a choice that costs her a rare forward glance. The novice and cartographer serve as pressure points, but the archivist’s interiority remains the crucible. The final Earned Stasis—her quiet retreat to the Rare Cartographies aisle—reads as both victory and ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot press into moss, her tear-tracked smile—yet the “insatiably creative” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation (planting tomorrow) is earned, but the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the restorer’s tactile needle-work and her layered silence-concept read as lived-in. Motivation (balance, not redemption) is consistent, and the final renunciation of looking back carries felt cost. Yet the character’s flaw/blind spot remains largely abstract—no on-page contradiction complicates her stance—so the arc edges toward archetype rather than fully individuated psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the grandmother memory anchors motive without overt exposition. The final act of witness is earned by prior pattern of micro-choices (yarrow sprig, tripod alignment). No contradictory impulses in scene, but the absence of visible cost at closure caps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s analytic detachment is embodied through precise sensory cataloguing and micro-choices (refusing food, whispering names). The final release of the globe is earned by the prior pattern of embodied experiments; the cost is the hollow warmth left in his palms. Interior contradiction—logic vs grief—remains active in scene, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The balladeer’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory; her micro-choice to press the bolt plate against the terminal crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Motivation remains consistent and deepens under pressure. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents relationship crucible scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the servant’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final acceptance is tender yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the contradiction between her scientific past and grief-driven cataloguing is palpable. The final smile is earned by the ledger entries and telescope cradling, showing cost. Yet the “quietly explosive” trait is asserted more than dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the contradiction between tactile genius and facial blindness drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—choosing to finish the sky rather than flee—earns its cost through prior texture-memory. Minor slip: the laugh feels slightly abstract rather than earned. Still, character coherence under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arlen’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—his fingertip tracing chalk, murmuring dead dialects, micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is specific and textured; no stock phrasing. The final hopscotch-cipher mastery is earned by prior pattern study and carries visible cost: he forfeits anonymity and orphan safety for public discovery. Only minor drift: Captain Veyra’s awe arrives quickly, slightly undercutting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    The locksmith's interiority crackles with contradiction: trembling from anticipation yet calm under pressure, solitary but haunted by refused love. Every reflection she confronts is filtered through her professional eye ("her first lock picked at age six") until the final renunciation when silver threads dissolve—an embodied cost visible on the page. Motivation feels deep-rooted, though the phrase “some truths only whisper where silence is thickest” edges toward gnomic abstraction rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s spectral presence is compelling, but her interiority remains abstract; the settlers’ shift from refugees to kin is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices. No single settler is granted enough page-time to embody contradictory impulses or pay a visible cost. The “strangely trustworthy” aura is stated, not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The adjuster’s interior contradiction—duty to cradle collapse vs. the ache of personal loss crystallized in the puppet—drives every micro-choice; the final whispered lullaby is earned by the long causal chain that begins in the flooded cellar. Emotion is embodied (scarred fingers, crystallized tears as tuning forks) rather than labeled. The only minor slip: “bruised awe” is named once rather than shown, but the body of evidence still overwhelms.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“he hated this duty—not the labor, but the silence”); contradictory impulses (resignation vs refusal to let the chorus grow) play out in micro-choices. The nut-hand-off is a credible renunciation with visible cost: he forfeits his private map and accepts more ghosts. Status dynamics are minimal—only a single line of dialogue—but the caretaker’s voice remains distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the chemist’s micro-choice to place the chrysalis in her notebook crystallizes her arc. Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. acceptance) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—reframing rupture as rhythm—earns its cost through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vendor’s interiority—need to unwrite herself—anchors every beat; the trembling fingers and ledger entries embody cost. Yet her contradictory impulse (to distribute her own void) is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, muting the final micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s tactile memory-tasting and emotional contagion are embodied through trembling gloved hands and the burn of borrowed heartbreak; her contradictory drive to absorb yet armor herself against sorrow is dramatized in the moment she removes the gloves. The final stance—hollowed but whole, grief now a vessel—earns its cost by the accumulated weight of every pillar touched.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied—her boots “echo like metronome ticks,” her satchel choice is deliberate—but the decisive turn (leaving the cuckoo weight as permanent anchor) is slightly under-motivated; we sense her empathy but not the precise cost she pays. The grain elevator’s shift from “mad” to “anthem” is credible, yet the children’s arrival dilutes her agency in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic; the engineer’s contradictory impulses (precision vs. chaos) play out in real time as she re-weights the child’s memory. The final act of pocketing the mirror carries visible cost—she accepts the entanglement and the night-long labor ahead—so the change is earned. Minor slip: “synaptic plasticity” is named more than dramatized, a touch of label-speak that keeps her from full 9-band immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s prism-minded cognition and fractured interiority are vividly embodied; every beat of decoding and bodily inversion under gravity reveals contradictory impulses. The moment she chooses to awaken rather than possess the Seed crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she is sealed outside the chamber and bears the whispering burden alone. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her sole struggle against her own limits is sharply etched.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—yearning for sound while fearing the hollowness he feels—remains embodied in fingertip-on-bark micro-choices; the final act of carving the resonance chamber is credibly foreshadowed by his earlier phantom strums and carries visible cost in the cracked porcelain embedded at the heart-wood. The hedgehog functions as a silent witness rather than pressure source, so relationship crucible is N/A; still, his motivation intensifies cleanly from passive listening to active translation of fracture into frequency. One hairline slip: “tears tracking…from recognition” edges toward label-speak, but the moment is saved by the preceding sensory weight of the grove’s returned breath.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—thumb on the stone’s dent anchors exile and memory—but the decisive shift from exile-as-wound to exile-as-compass is asserted more than dramatized; no on-page micro-choice visibly forecloses a path, so the cost feels inferred rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The interior voice is vivid and particular, and Elara’s micro-choices under pressure are concrete. Slight over-articulation of motives (lines like “her belief was not academic, but sacred”) slips toward label-speak. Earned stasis is visible as she chooses to absorb the moment rather than confront fireworks—cost felt in body stillness and warm clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory synesthesia and bark-fiber journal anchor a singular perceptual signature. The seed’s dormancy and bloom force her to act (replanting the husk) with visible cost (accepting impermanence). Minor slip: “wisdom flows not in spite of chaos, but because of it” edges toward thesis-statement rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. reverent listening—surface in embodied micro-choices (gripping throttle, cradling arrow). The final renunciation of “fixing” is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost: she commits to return each inversion, foreclosing other missions.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single POV investigator’s interiority is concrete and embodied; patch, wind, and silence act as externalized pressure. Motivation—“to map the next disaster”—is reiterated through micro-choices (planting sensors, stepping into wind). Final stance crystallizes with felt cost: “Let it know I was watching.” No contradictory impulses shown mid-scene, so 9+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; synesthetic gift is shown through action. Motive—"to certify wonder"—is stated, but the final choice to walk away feels slightly under-motivated; no visible internal contradiction at the climax. Still, the character’s sensory lens is consistent and individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulse to “harvest insights from failure” while honoring the Council’s “Never again” drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—leaving the flute as monument—earns its cost through prior causal chain. Only the apprentice’s late question feels slightly expository, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The operator’s interiority is rich—grief borrowed, empathy eroded, motives gnawing—but her decisive act (final glyph, fragment relinquished) is slightly under-motivated by the prior causal chain; the cost is felt yet not fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling not from cold but from the weight of his absence”), yet the courier’s decisive release of the pendant feels slightly under-motivated—no prior beat shows her weighing its loss against the wonder-seed she’s just planted. Micro-choices (fork in path, handing over casket, freeing pendant) are present and escalate, but the final renunciation would land harder if earlier beats had tested her attachment more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mystic’s interiority is precise—her fingers “tracing the glass prism’s edges as if reading braille” shows embodied motive. Her refusal to publish crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost (silence as forfeiture). The only drag is a brief diagnostic echo—“emotion is mass”—but it’s offset by prior embodied proof.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific; the spinner’s contradictory impulse—cling to memory yet dissolve into the weave—drives every beat. Her final renunciation is foreshadowed by the amber bead’s pulse and the loom’s reconfiguration, so the sacrifice feels inevitable and costly. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she understood”) mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlo’s interiority is embodied in soot-stained forearms and the press of palm to cold wall; his quiet determination is dramatized through micro-choices—folding silk into nails, handing a hinge to a child—each carrying visible cost. The final renunciation (“He had become the barter”) is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of further silk use. No contradictory impulses are shown simultaneously in scene, but the single POV is so tight that the absence is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her hunger for truth and the cost of erasure is dramatized in the final beat. The moment she weeps for “unbearable lightness” crystallizes a credible renunciation. Minor slip: the phrase “cyclically spontaneous failure” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence, grief, and caretaker impulse are embodied in every micro-choice (humming, stone-cairn ritual, refusal to read letters). The final stacking of stones crystallizes a credible renunciation: he chooses anonymous service over personal voice, paying the cost of continued solitude. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The sea-glass anchor and stone-message act as externalized contradiction between memory and forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    The herald’s interiority is lyrically vivid—her laughter as “wind chimes forged from lightning” embodies her paradoxical nature—but her choices remain largely atmospheric rather than tactical. The single decisive micro-choice (blowing the kiss that steers possibility) is under-motivated by prior interior contradiction, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the dye master’s contradictory impulses (to steal yet seek truth) are dramatized through tactile handling of the wing and the borrowed heartbeat. Micro-choices—watching the old man, deciding to cultivate her own fractures—are visible and costly. The final refusal to explain the fabric’s effect is an earned renunciation that forecloses the path of easy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the worker’s shift from technician to pilgrim is credible. Motivation (arboreal witness) is specific and sustained, but the final beat of “remembering for them” feels slightly abstract rather than a concrete choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    The keeper’s interiority is vivid—her half-remembered lullabies and barefoot climb embody her fractured mind—but her decisive shift from curator to loom is asserted more than dramatized; the final beat lacks a micro-choice that shows her paying the cost of letting the realm sing through her.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is rich, contradictory, and embodied (“her fingers brushing the paper like a prayer”), but the final renunciation is slightly under-motivated: the pivot from shame to self-acceptance feels compressed rather than earned by a visible micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the bread-handling, seed-pressing, and shawl-dropping all carry contradictory pulses of grief and reclamation. The final stance—cross-legged sipping cold tea while water awakens—crystallizes a renunciation whose cost is felt. Yet the “creeping normality” lens is declared more than dramatized; we rarely see her actually mis-read the world, so the flaw feels named rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is precise and embodied—“tears froze on her cheeks before they fell”—but her contradictory impulses remain mostly implied; the final whispered vow feels earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is concrete—fear calcified into purpose, heartbeat synced to tide—yet the girl’s contradictory impulses (listen vs. act) stay submerged; her final retreat crystallizes a stance without tidy epiphany. Motivation is rooted in generational betrayal and embodied through the fob. Micro-choices (dropping coin, dangling brass) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is felt in the silence after trust snaps.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The skeptic’s interiority is vivid—her doubt is embodied in the metallic taste of copper and the cold burn of the ring. Her micro-choice to taste the soil and follow the compass anchors her arc. The final surrender of the ring into her pocket crystallizes a credible shift from doubt to trust, with visible cost (the relinquishing of her guiding tool).

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“charcoal-fingered,” “twitch—not from cold”), but the final transformation leans on lyric assertion more than dramatized contradiction; the apology to her child-self lands as earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority remains tactile and embodied (“color returned to her cheeks”). Yet she never faces a hard contradiction between her collector drive and the price of witnessing: her “curse” evaporates the moment she reads, so the final stance feels lightly purchased rather than cost-full.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell tuner’s muteness and tactile craft are vividly embodied; her silent choices—kneeling to place a child’s hand on ice, daily climbs—drive every beat. Interior contradiction is subtle but present in her refusal to speak yet urgent need to transmit wonder. The final image of her absence still tuned by wind crystallizes an earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—nostalgia vs caretaking imperative—drives every beat; the burn choice crystallizes a hierarchy of values (care over self-preservation) with visible cost (bioluminescent graft). Motivation stays rooted in coded memory yet escalates to active transformation. Minor slip: “smiled, a gesture not programmed but grown” edges toward meta-label.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—curating catharsis—drives every action; the locket’s grief and her humming are embodied choices that cost her anonymity and time. Leo’s interiority is sketched rather than dramatized, but the final renunciation (letting the locket go home) is earned by the four-day ritual. The micro-choice to sit and hum, not knock, crystallizes her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is embodied in her precise, spider-like motions and the tactile memory of her mother’s lullaby; her choice to remain and encrypt the core instead of boarding the submersible crystallizes her arc with visible cost—self-erasure. Motivation is consistently rooted in “encrypt vulnerability as strength,” and every micro-choice (heel strike, wrist flick, dice roll) flows from that trait. The final renunciation lands as Earned Stasis, foreclosing escape for a larger liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, suspended tears—yet her contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are shown more than enacted; the reunion beat lands with earned cost, but the father’s sudden appearance feels slightly under-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“her heartbeat syncing with the rustle of ferns”), but the summoner’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure alters tactics. The final renunciation—accepting perpetual guardianship—earns stasis yet the cost feels diffuse rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor’s quiet, obsessive desire to “write back” to the building is embodied in tactile micro-choices—folding birds, pressing the seal—so motivation stays concrete. The weekly sugar ritual and final exchange of key/ seal crystallize a relationship whose stakes shift from polite fiction to shared covenant. Her flaw—solitary listening turned active dialogue—compounds when she accepts the cost of descent. Closure is earned: she renounces further lies and steps into the basement’s full sentences, cost legible in the seal’s weight and the key’s cold.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush, specific, and embodied (“dread pooling in her ribs,” “salt-tongued secrets”). The contradiction between skepticism and charmed surrender is active in every beat; the final vow is earned by the prior cataloguing. Micro-choices (kneel, place shell, whisper back) trace a credible shift from witness to sovereign. No other characters on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her trembling fingers, the thorn pricking her thumb—but the final beat of “wisely released” feels slightly over-articulated, nudging the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The echo-singer’s interiority is concrete and embodied (throat raw, soul lighter), motivations progress from personal question to sacrifice, and the final choice of renunciation (not destroying) is earned. The mute child and harvested entity remain functions more than secondary beings, so relationship/status axes remain undeveloped, but the core arc is driven and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied (“her breath curling like incense,” “palms flat against the ice altar”); the contradictory impulse—salvage purity yet risk shattering truth—drives the final placement of the globe. Motivation stays character-bound and intensifies under pressure; the smile at the end is earned cost. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV depth compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is textured and embodied—e.g., “bare feet cool on slick stone” and the widow’s memory. Motivation (to honor unseen labor) is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (whistling names, pressing palm to stone). Final renunciation—leaving no mark—earns stasis with visible cost. Minor: no contradictory impulses enacted simultaneously, only alternation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory sorrow-smile at the orchard’s beauty shows simultaneous awe and grief. Micro-choice—pressing the diamond into soil—directly reconfigures stakes and forecloses safety. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies with each discovery. Only minor: competence edges toward too-perfect recall of radiation charts.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her gritty laugh, the ink on vellum, the meteor-dust ink—yet her contradictory impulses (pity vs defiance) remain mostly summarized rather than enacted in a single, pressured beat. The final broadcast choice is foreshadowed but not dramatized on the page; we see the trigger (her song) but not the moment of irrevocable cost. Secondary characters exist only as off-page whispers, so relationship crucible is absent. Still, her voice is distinct and her flaw (refusal to accept sterile unity) drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical yet grounded in embodied ritual (jar-capture, cork-wax sealing); the poet’s contradictory impulses—self-erasure vs. generational bridge—surface in the silent gift-giving. Motivation intensifies from survival to redemption via the music-box repair, a micro-choice that visibly costs his solitude. Final renunciation (leaving the loft and legacy) is earned by prior causal chain. Minor: we never witness a genuine mistake that compounds, keeping him slightly too competent for full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid (“logically emotional to her marrow”) and embodied choices (syncing breath to ice) drive every beat; the final renunciation of force for consonance is earned. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy clear: key → Heartstone → harmonic counter-song.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapper’s interiority is embodied in lunar-synced breath and chalk-on-iron gestures; her renunciation of spectacle for stillness is earned through tactile ritual. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—only serene resolve—so the arc edges toward monolith. Still, the final kneel carries visible cost: she surrenders the right to claim victory aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied; the investigator’s refusal to panic and her empirical stance are dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling, placing the lantern, etching names). The final renunciation—leaving the lantern—earns its cost via prior causality. Minor: the mother’s warning is summary, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s guilt-driven precision and the embodied micro-choices at the bench (thermos ritual, reverent winding) make his need for penance visceral; the final beat grants self-forgiveness only after the heart’s imperfect pulse mirrors his own flaw, earning the renunciation of lifelong shame. Interior contradiction is alive in every torque of a screwdriver that might fail him again. No label-speak, no safety-hedging; the man is as broken as the gears. Cost is felt in the snapped spring he must re-start at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zeta’s curiosity-driven agency is embodied in every micro-choice—jamming the arrow, humming glyphs, sketching upgrades—yet the piece withholds deeper interior contradiction; the final “irreverent, awesome” stance is earned but not visibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is concrete—"silence screamed louder than alerts"—and motives (curiosity, guilt, stewardship) tighten through escalating lies; final endurance of silence is earned. Missing only a deeper contradiction in her own psyche to reach 9.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“shadow-laced,” “boots crunching brittle frost”), contradictions between duty and fragility are dramatized in real time, and the final choice to carry the humming fragment is earned by the preceding beats of resonance and cost. No headcount or relationship pressure to test.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. surrender—are embodied in her tactile use of the parasol tip; the final renunciation of euthanasia is earned by the prior listening arc and carries visible cost in her changed stance. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “terminally curious” flirts with label-speak but is immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning vs. acceptance of mismatch—is embodied in the burned letter and vineyard imagery; Mara’s brittle resistance and softening feel earned. The micro-choice of offering his hand without pulling her up crystallizes his trait. The final renunciation (no reconciliation) carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: Mara’s interiority is slightly less textured.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The walker’s interiority is textured and embodied (“warm stone floor,” “spent focus”), but her motives remain largely static; the consecration is performed rather than struggled. No internal contradiction or visible flaw complicates the act, so the “earned” quality feels mild. The mask’s asymmetry hints at duality yet never pressures a choice. Overall, a vivid consciousness without a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the archivist’s micro-choices (tracing kite tail, murmuring to lavender) reveal motive. Yet the “collective healing” drive stays abstract—no contradictory impulse or visible cost at closure to crystallize her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Quiet, single-POV interiority shows contradiction in scene and an earned renunciation—“I don’t know”—that forecloses her data route with audible cost. Scholar’s weathered innocence threads into micro-choices. Only flaw: one stock metaphor “ghost-utterance” blunts interior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific; the prophet’s contradictory impulses (to remember and to forget) play out in micro-choices—arranging driftwood, dragging chalk—each with visible cost. The final renunciation (walking backward, leaving the chalk) is earned by prior causality and carries a felt price. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the chronometer, the remembered leaf-sound—but her contradictory impulses (freeze vs restructure time) are asserted more than dramatized in-scene; the final renunciation is emotionally legible yet feels slightly foregone rather than wrested from visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s serene vocation and “decisively kind” trait anchor every micro-choice; the broken vinyl functions as embodied memory and tool, but interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical summary rather than contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira's quiet deliberation is embodied in steady ink-stained fingers and meticulous nightly ritual; paradoxes compel rather than paralyze her. The choice to "become noon's opposite" at climax is foreshadowed by her refusal to flee or scream earlier, a cost foreclosing ordinary scholar life. Interiority blends scholarly rigor with visceral awe, contradictions intact. Character-specific perceptual stamp—"shadows as liquid night"—remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the skeptic’s contradictory impulses (pity vs. shrewdness) act simultaneously. Motivation to “turn mistakes into constellations” is dramatized through the ritual with the tooth. The final renunciation—leaving the tooth to root—carries felt cost and is earned by prior causality. Only minor: the grandmother backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly diluting present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific; the vow “to share light without using fire” drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—surrendering the shard to communal gaze—carries visible cost (her silence, her knees, her exile) and is earned by the entire accumulative pattern. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, keeping her just shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the amber pendant and moss underfoot anchor contradictory impulses. The final renunciation—placing the viral confession beneath moss—earns its cost through prior pattern study and embodied memory. Motivation (“reclamation”) is consistent but slightly abstract; a sharper internal contradiction would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—trembling fingers, tide-pool eyes—but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational; the final act of release is more posture than pressured decision, so the cost feels attenuated.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her pride in the “moss and machine oil” paradox, the tactile memory-work of winters and autumns—but the decisive moment (lifting the final note) is slightly under-motivated; we feel her reverence more than the cost of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—her knees in permafrost, blood sizzling on frost—but the “translate heartbeats into maps” motive is stated more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene to complicate the final stance, so the cost feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lucid, embodied, and character-specific (“he had to glance sideways, let intuition stitch together what logic refused to name”). The culminating micro-choice—seal the resin slab and walk away—earns Earned Stasis with clear emotional cost: he exits alone, wonder stored but not shared, a monkish renunciation palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the weaver’s micro-choice to calcify her own locket at the end crystallizes her paradoxical entrapment with visible cost. Motivation remains consistent: service as both prison and purpose. No stock phrasing; the “boundary-lessly trapped” contradiction is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s interiority is textured and embodied; her micro-choice to let the kettle boil dry crystallizes the shift from passive mourning to active containment. The contradiction between her “hauntingly practical” stance and the emotional risk of carving Viktor’s absence is dramatized in the moment she presses chisel to wood. The final Earned Stasis—refusing rescue by tea—carries visible cost and closes the arc. Minor slip: the phrase “harvest lessons from loss” edges toward label-speak before it is re-earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“I must negotiate with my own ghost”—and embodied in the spire encounter. Micro-choices (winding camera, accepting envelope) show hierarchy of values. Flawed ambition is dramatized, not labeled. Final renunciation feels earned by prior regret and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s curiosity and engineering mindset are vividly embodied—she measures footfalls, repurposes steam, and sketches questions rather than blueprints. The internal contradiction between stoic observation and creative intervention drives every beat. Her final recalibration of the sextant shows earned endurance with visible cost: she foregoes rest to keep adapting the ruin. One hairline slip: the “new equations for hope” verge on label-speak, though the embodied work mostly redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied; the contradiction between his clock-care and abandoned music is kept alive in every micro-gesture. The final renunciation—to hum rather than compose—earns its cost through the crystal’s water-drop revelation on the score. Only the “excruciatingly gentle” trait edges toward label when repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and embodied (“temperature of forgotten time”); the seeker’s contradictory impulse—wait, not chase—drives every beat. The final renunciation (carrying peace, not proof) is earned by the locket’s inscription and costs him the chase-identity he arrived with. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices (kneel, watch, not reach) reveal hierarchy of values cleanly. Flaw persists: he’s still a solitary observer, but that stasis is the point and is priced on page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and consistent; the collector’s shift from seed-gathering to “collecting hands” is earned through patient mimicry and tactile learning. Havel’s gnarled driftwood fingers and rasping voice give him weight without cliché. The only drag is the slightly over-articulated “I’m collecting hands,” which edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the traveler's contradictory impulses—mapping absence to keep the gone present—are dramatized in every micro-choice (folding the crane, tucking it beneath the roots). Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the final renunciation: not closure, but orientation. The thread-as-memory constrains tactics and charges the ending with felt cost. No slips.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prince’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the egg cradled “with exhaustion and hope” crystallizes motive. Micro-choices (threading copper veins, calibrating pendulums) reveal hierarchy of values. Final kneel-laugh embodies earned cost. Minor drift: “obsolete” label edges diagnostic-speak but is quickly re-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“black sand clings to her knees, gritty and grounding”), but the final “runs toward fire” beat is slightly too compressed to register the full cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The skeptic’s interiority is sharp—her “realistically imaginative” stance is shown through micro-choices like mapping acoustics instead of worshipping ghosts. The final insertion of the key is a credible renunciation of her own detachment, costing her the box’s weight and her observer role. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however; the shift from skeptic to enabler is asserted more than embodied, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sentimentalist’s interiority is richly embodied—hands “threaded with starlight,” the gear’s weight felt—yet the arc drifts more than it tightens; the final “troubling serenity” registers as mood rather than a concrete renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “quiet intensity” and tactile memory of poems give him specificity. The contradiction between carving grief and needing to join it is dramatized in the final ribbon beat. Silas’s silent guidance is credible ghost-mentorship, never explanatory. Cost is felt when Elias ties the last ribbon and accepts perpetual apprenticeship.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s compulsive precision and quiet guilt are embodied in every tactile detail; the contradictory impulses—perfection vs. surrender—collide in the pendulum pause, producing a credible renunciation that costs him his lifelong identity as winder. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the final barefoot stance on the ridge externalizes the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—her lullaby to headstones, ivy behind cherubs’ wings—but the decisive shift from caretaker to “stitcher of intentions” is slightly under-motivated; the silo’s “call” is poetic yet abstract, so the needle choice feels gifted rather than earned. Still, her embodied grief and micro-gestures (threading her own sleeve-dusk) keep contradiction alive in scene. Cost is visible: she forfeits the comfort of lullabies for the unrest of questions. Just shy of 9 because the causal hinge between sovereign case and needle could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“breath curling in the frozen air,” “equations unfold behind her lids”), but the absence of on-page opposition or secondary pressure keeps the character arc largely reflective; the final choice to write “Begin” is resonant yet cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the copyist’s contradictory impulses (precision vs. rebellion, grief vs. hope) play out in micro-choices like calibrating the dial by fingertip heat. Motivation crystallizes through action—her tears activate the resurrection cycle—earning the final broadcast decision with visible cost (ink blurred, thumb singed). Minor slip: “thistled calm” abstracts rather than embodies the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ash scatterer’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the mask’s history yet scattering ashes to release memory—are embodied in her micro-choices (bare feet, deliberate scattering). The final motionless sit in the rocking chair is earned by prior ritual, carrying visible cost: she accepts the silence she once feared. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic labels. Only a slight under-articulation of the mask’s emotional weight in the final beat keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the philosopher’s pacing, tactile handling of artifacts, and quiet defiance all reveal layered motives. The final descent with cog against sternum crystallizes an earned renunciation whose cost is felt. Minor drift: the Council envoys never apply direct interpersonal pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, but the single-POV design excuses that.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied; the rosette-touch anchors memory and motive. Her “expectant resignation” is dramatized in the choice to stay and the final invitation. Micro-choice—humming into silence—forecloses retreat and carries felt cost. Only minor drift into gentle abstraction keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s synesthetic memory-tasting is vivid and embodied; her pruning choices visibly rewire grief into softer utility. The librarian’s whispered instruction seeds a credible micro-choice (planting with intention), and her final renunciation—refusing to harvest—earns a felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, though the “gentle rebellion” label edges toward diagnostic speak. Overall, a strong, character-bound arc with minor diction slips.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s compulsive truth-telling and wonder-keeper motive are embodied in concrete micro-choices (handing over the lightning-glyph matchbox, guiding the ladder ascent). Interior contradiction surfaces when he withholds the full explanation despite his “truth” compulsion, paying the cost of secrecy to protect wonder. The final recognition of the woman’s lineage crystallizes a generational transfer of guardianship with visible emotional cost. Only slight under-characterization of the woman keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The noticer’s interiority is textured and embodied—“hushed blaze” in her ribs, bare feet on damp pavement. Motivation is rooted in a specific, idiosyncratic quest: to feel houses as living presences. Micro-choice—placing the orris shard—carries visible cost: she relinquishes the relic to the tide. No contradictory impulses on the page, but the arc is more observational than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the historian’s awe and oxygen debt are visceral. The statue’s “incisively kind” voice is a consistent, characterizing trait that drives the final choice. Micro-choice—pressing the ampoule against the fracture—earns the closure cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene for the statue itself, only stated, keeping it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the die-click heartbeat and the tactile memory of the arcade ground the grim optimist’s regret. Motivation is consistent: every micro-choice (carving proofs, rolling the die, touching the reflection) is driven by the need to “capture the texture” of the missed throw. The final renunciation—climbing on without the die—earns its cost because the staircase has already digested his proofs and the reflection has re-priced the regret. Minor slip: “balancedly daring” is asserted more than dramatized in the moment-to-moment climbs.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the painter’s contradictory impulses (solitude vs outreach) remain active in scene. Motivation is clear and escalates from private ritual to communal act. The final gesture—accepting the girl—earns a credible renunciation of isolation with visible cost. Minor drift into abstract “kindness” labels keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to ghosts yet feeding the living—surface in the bread ritual and the lens shift from ghost-hunter to living-framer. Interiority is embodied (flour-dusted trembling fingers) and stakes escalate with each loaf. The final renunciation of preservation in favor of becoming art is earned and carries visible communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clockmaker’s interiority is precise and embodied—“salt spray gnawed at his coat,” “neatly inventive mind already dissecting”—and his contradictory impulses (refusal of inherited fate vs. carrying its weight) play out in real-time micro-choices. The final beat earns its renunciation: he accepts solitary cost with a “bitter and bright” smile, the gear in pocket sealing the arc. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV depth compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “unbosom” act is a visceral micro-choice that crystallizes the arc. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies under pressure. Minor slip: the advisor’s motives stay opaque, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prophet’s motive—turn obstacles into instruments—drives every beat, but interiority stays broad; Kael’s awe is sketched more than embodied. The final transfer of the mallet crystallizes a credible micro-shift in status and responsibility, yet Prophet’s exhaustion is stated rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied—“hollow ache lodged beneath her ribs,” “reed whistle tucked against her sternum like a second heart.” Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread) coexist in scene. Final resolve to climb the ridge at midnight is earned by seventeen seasons of iterative failure and the watcher’s micro-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    The historian’s interiority is lucid and contradictory—she weeps at symphonies but refuses to derail from evidence, a tension that tightens in the final beat. Micro-choice—fingertip tracing the king’s letter—crystallizes resolve; her resolve to “ask who does it serve” forecloses the myth without triumph yet exacts the cost of public betrayal. Relationship/secondary pressure absent limits score.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—stoic resolve versus raw sensitivity—drives every micro-choice; the moment she cradles the mildewed doll and writes “You were loved” crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Motivation remains rooted and intensifies as the inkwell empties, anchoring her transformation from surveyor to scribe-priestess. No relationship crucible on page, but her solitary stance shift earns credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The indexer’s interiority is precise—her quiet calibration of mind, the tactile bite of the stamp—yet her contradictory impulses (truth vs survival, renunciation vs witness) never surface in the final ascent beat. Micro-choices (ledger extraction, cross-referencing, final annotation) are visible but framed in declarative summary rather than embodied pressure, blurring emotional stakes moment-to-moment. Endurance is earned but lacks a palpable before/after fracture on the final stair.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s grief is embodied in origami cranes and lantern craft; interiority is vivid, but the final transformation feels slightly under-motivated—his smile arrives without a prior beat of contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is embodied and trauma-tuned, but the “calibrated desperation” summary edges toward diagnostic label-speak; the final leap into the dark earns cost via the geode’s pulse syncing her heartbeat, yet the absence of any second character keeps relational stakes off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied ("tears tracing paths through dust"); micro-choice of aligning star-trails with chip is decisive. Yet the shift from external mission to internal resonance is slightly front-loaded rather than earned in-scene, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s guilt and vocational shame are embodied in tactile micro-choices (bare feet on tiles, vomiting into surf). The withheld-truth motive intensifies cleanly to the final renunciation. One slip: the “ballast” epiphany edges toward tidy summation rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the drawer pull anchors memory and choice. The negotiator’s “uncommonly thoughtful” trait manifests in micro-listening beats that tilt the final stance. Cost is felt when she trades relics and ghosts. Minor slack: the brother’s fate is backstory rather than on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; contradictory impulses (“merrily melancholic surrender”) play in real time. The compass-as-witness choice crystallizes her arc with visible cost. One slip: “broken navigator felt no need to name her course” edges toward tidy self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The seeker's interiority is vivid—"hollow might fill with something warmer than regret"—and the micro-choice to release the baseball crystallizes the arc. Motivation stays consistent: not redemption but manufactured empathy. The final climb carries earned cost. Only the "dirty past" remains abstract, blunting contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the whisperer’s contradictory hunger—quiet yet ravenous—drives every micro-choice. The final surrender is credibly rooted in prior refusals and the cookie’s recursive invitation, so the bond’s re-forging carries felt cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Flaw is static: she never missteps or doubts once spices burn, so tension is emotional, not moral.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—trembling fingers, smudged ink, heartbeat-tattoo—but the shift from cartomancer to mother is asserted more than dramatized; still, the final micro-choice (pressing palm to earth) crystallizes the arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s pacifism, grief, and need for reunion are embodied in every micro-choice—floating when joyful, sinking when sorrowful, stitching dimensional seams with her own breath. The shadow-self confrontation crystallizes her internal contradiction and delivers earned change: she carries her darkness as a wing, not a wound. Cost is palpable when Kwan Yin’s Tear dissolves, foreclosing return. Only the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relationship-as-crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the “texture of transformation” motive is dramatized through each bottle-opening micro-choice. Contradictory impulses (stay vs. release) surface in the fourth bug’s dissolution into her chest, earning the final radiant stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her silhouette sharp… fingers tracing… bronze quill holder—cold, heavy”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain implicit rather than dramatized; the final choice is foreshadowed yet lacks a visible cost on the page, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“curse that showed him seconds before they happened”), but the grandmother’s promise is delivered as exposition rather than dramatized memory; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied ("fingertips brushing the cold brass," "pulse matched the darkroom timer"), but the poet’s final stance—refusing to open the envelope—rests more on ritual than on a visible cost that alters her options. The contradiction between furious and tranquil is stated, not dramatized in a single decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The philosopher’s mechanical arm, brass twitch, and needle card give vivid specificity, but interior contradiction is only implied; the final partnership feels earned yet the cost of his past “fire and screws” remains abstract. Relationship crucible is present but under-pressured; the woman’s arrival shifts status yet their joint choice lacks a visible personal toll.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Molt’s shift from sardonic armor to seed-planting gardener is dramatized through concrete beats: the nail-pinning of Elias’s poem, the candle, the whispered flower names. Interior contradiction is shown, not told, when “the old skin of cynicism peel[s] away” as she kneels in dust. The cost—loss of Elias and of her own protective detachment—is legible and scaled to the word count. Only minor deduction for the off-stage friendship origin that supplies the emotional pivot without on-page micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—grief for her vanished lover vs. the audacious need to “surprise fate”—are embodied in every micro-choice (tuning chords to bend gravity, threading the film reel). The final chord is earned by the prior mapping of harmonic resonance and the cost of burning the reel. Interiority is specific, never generic; even the single laugh behind her lands as embodied consequence. One hairline slip: the phrase “surprise fate with an unplanned encore” flirts with label-speak, but the surrounding action redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s protective drive is vivid and embodied; the moment he presses the seed into soil crystallizes his interior contradiction between certainty and doubt. Micro-choices (selecting Elira, chanting, tracing glyphs) all flow from this motive. The final smile carries earned cost: the seed is gone, responsibility transferred. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elio’s interiority is precise—his tactile attention to soil and lace, the deliberate cadence of his voice, and the embodied cost of each micro-choice (spiral, zigzag, circle) all reveal a layered motive. The contradiction between seeking color and diffusing regret is dramatized, not stated. The final smile and trembling leaf crystallize earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority excels with concrete micro-choices (rearranging scalpels, timing footsteps) revealing contradictory impulses—thief/conscience—but the child’s internal conflict beyond the central premise lacks slight depth for 9.0. Motivation crystallizes perfectly through ink’s action on the contract.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority shines through concrete sensory choices ("measured epochs by curl of a leaf’s edge"), but peak epiphany ("mountain was a chorus") edges toward over-articulation without sufficient embodied struggle preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interior contradiction shines in logbook reveal ("her own handwriting"), where shock and recognition drive her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s motivation (healing vs conquest) and telepathic burden feel concrete through embodied choices ("pressing palm to floor," "let telepathy bloom"), but the Chancellor’s shift to "dawning reverence" lacks sufficient friction in his prior portrayal, slightly undercutting the cost of his dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)

Kael’s micro-shift from frustration to revelation earns the closure without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in stillness-as-alignment vs. generations' futile motion, but "weathered resolve" borders on label-speak; cost is embodied via the arrowhead's physical resonance at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
