    Aris's internal contradiction between seeking spectacle for her field versus recognizing truth in gradual transformation drives authentic tension. The final choice to embrace patience over drama lands with earned cost through her prior struggle. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("profound humility kindle within her") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes believably from survival to purpose-seeking through concrete details like the ledger strip and frost patterns. Her artist's eye transferring to tracker mode shows consistent characterization. Deduction for some abstract phrasing ("purpose in the pauses") and slight emotional smoothness in transitions from trauma to investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing frost, adjusting equipment, sketching notes). Her internal contradiction between seeking sonic memory and embracing visual translation drives genuine tension. The final choice to translate warmth into music shows earned transformation with visible cost—three years of struggle crystallizing into acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and embodied through physical detail (calloused fingers, slumped shoulders), with internal contradiction between his exhaustion and stubborn persistence driving the descent. The final choice to maintain eternal vigil shows genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("restless echoes trapped beneath the waves") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (leading midnight runs, teaching youth), with his "gently persistent nature" shown through repeated risk-taking. The transformation from isolation to intergenerational continuity lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hope into a scarce commodity") and limited internal contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation through the past-life memory of failing Kwan Yin creates genuine internal conflict, with embodied details like "hands stained with developer chemicals, trembled slightly" and the visceral recollection anchoring her quest. The transformation from withheld love to release is earned through concrete action (breathing technique, using the tear), with visible cost in "dissolving the stagnant pool within her."

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Aris's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives concrete choices under pressure, with embodied emotion in "trembling fingers" and "heart hammered." The final renunciation (leaving photographs behind) carries visible cost, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("grief...lived in the hollow where memories used to be").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect the seed vault is clear and consistent, with embodied tension in "the ache in her wrists" and concrete internal conflict between her physical bondage and purposeful mission. The final choice to shield the seeds with her chained body demonstrates meaningful sacrifice with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("liberation she sought wasn't for herself but for the land") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear and embodied through specific action—her quest to isolate "the precise, shattering sound of trust breaking" drives every technical choice. The betrayal memory provides concrete emotional grounding, though the final tears feel slightly predictable rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief over her mother's disappearance, with concrete embodied tension ("heart hammered against her ribs"). The internal shift from seeking her mother to finding herself feels earned through the floral codes revelation. However, the epiphany about "finding herself within the illuminated moments" edges toward therapeutic abstraction, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to create "safe zones for inquiry" drives consistent action, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("grief had frozen him," "his heart fully thawed") rather than embodied contradiction. The dramatic narration quirk provides character texture yet never complicates his choices or creates cost. His final transformation from isolation to community engagement happens through assertion rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in betrayal, with concrete internal conflict between fear and determination. The embodied aquaphobia ("river's memory still coiled in her gut") and micro-choices (filming despite shaking hands) reveal character under pressure. However, the epiphany about vulnerability as power feels slightly unearned given the swift resolution, and some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("weaponizing what Lena dismissed").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's obsessive drive to preserve and translate the prophecy creates clear, escalating motivation throughout. The internal contradiction between her oracle's gift blooming at the peaceful shore versus her current storm-tossed isolation drives authentic tension. Her transformation from passive receiver of prophecy to active cartographer of silence shows earned agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Unit 7's motivation is clear but mechanically executed through tell-heavy passages like "without tracing thought's origin, sentience remained an imitation, not truth." The character lacks embodied emotion or genuine internal contradiction—it remains "remarkably composed" throughout without cost to that composure. The final realization arrives through assertion rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's curiosity-driven transformation from passive observer to active participant is well-motivated, with her final choice to bridge the mistrust carrying visible social cost. The musicians' motivations feel authentic through their embodied tension and brief dialogue, though their internal states rely somewhat on Elara's interpretation rather than direct access.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through sixty years of pragmatic wisdom versus the Quantifiers' sterile metrics. Her ritual of polishing cracked marbles reveals contradictory impulses—honoring imperfection while deceiving the overseers. The final choice to place the marble as "an offering to the earth" shows earned renunciation with visible cost in her "withered frame stiff but steady."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to prove lateral time is clear and consistent, driving her to risk using station equipment. Her internal conflict between obliging duty and scientific passion creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat linear—vindication arrives without sufficient internal resistance or cost beyond "years of ridicule."

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to prove the ghost legend and uncover truth drives consistent action throughout, with embodied tension ("Heart hammering," "damp pages clinging to his chest like a second heartbeat"). The transformation from seeking musical codes to discovering an innocence map shows earned progression. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("liminal world suspended between ruin and revelation") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between guilt and duty manifests through embodied details like "the hollow ache beneath her ribs" and the compulsion to measure unmeasurable grief. The final acceptance of error as integrated data rather than erasable flaw shows earned character evolution with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo's skepticism creating internal tension against mounting supernatural evidence works well, with his physical engagement with the valve wheel showing embodied choice under pressure. The transformation from skeptic to "keeper of the swallowed truth" feels earned through concrete discovery, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("crushing lightness of a lie") rather than fully embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—duty to witness versus the urge to save—crystallize beautifully in the collapse moment, with her final acceptance carrying visible emotional cost. The "grips reality loosely" trait manifests concretely through her perception of shadows as living things and drives her need for the refuge's regenerative silence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the flute and curl. Leo's transformation from terror to wonder is earned through specific dramatized moments. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("ordinary magic," "softly adaptive resilience") rather than fully embodied perception, and the father remains underdeveloped beyond his stress marker.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation to preserve human memory is clear and drives her methodical actions. Her "sensitively perceptive" trait manifests through concrete detection of wall vibrations and textile harmonics. The characterization succeeds through embodied action rather than declaration, though emotional complexity could deepen beyond the archival mission.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization with Elara's isolation-yearning contradiction driving genuine internal conflict. The moment of panic transforming into focused action under pressure shows earned agency. Minor deduction for Chen's cryptic wisdom feeling slightly convenient, though his established pattern of "accidentally prophetic" messages partially earns this.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Anselm's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (painting silence, using the loop pedal), with internal contradiction between faith and technology creating genuine tension. The final realization about collective belief feels earned through his specific struggle, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("The hidden assumption: the anchor existed independently").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to conduct unheard symphonies through memory-mapping is clear and embodied through concrete actions like pressing the shell to her temple. The exhaustion cost lands physically with her collapse. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("chronologically homesick") that isn't fully earned through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" manifests through concrete encounters with fractured versions of himself, each requiring embodied choice (walking through the younger self, rejecting the older). The internal contradiction between needing to move forward while confronting past selves creates genuine tension. However, the epiphany "The labyrinth isn't out there...It's the path you walk *now*" edges toward therapy-speak, diminishing what was otherwise strong embodied characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's deafness and emotional numbness create layered internal conflict, with the broken needle discovery driving a credible transformation from defeat to reclamation. The shift from "defeat tasted like dust" to feeling music's "raw, physical soul" shows earned change through concrete action, though Silas remains functional rather than fully pressurizing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's meticulous nature and commitment to integrity create genuine internal conflict when forced to choose between isolation and intervention. Her contradictory impulses (duty to data vs. moral obligation) play out through concrete actions like pacing the mosaic path and examining the message tube. The final choice to leave the gate unlocked carries visible cost - abandoning her protective ritual established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied grief through specific sensory memories (yeast, soap, rain on cobblestones) and the contradictory impulse between preserving and releasing memory. The final renunciation to "broker no more lanterns" carries visible cost. Minor deduction for slight diagnostic phrasing in "synesthetic grief" that briefly abstracts the embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—fingers seeking texture, examining knots, testing patterns—with her poet's need to capture time's dual nature driving concrete choices. The internal conflict between preserving beauty versus sharing it manifests in her third-path solution, though the energy beings remain somewhat abstract as pressure sources.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to find beauty in fracture is embodied through concrete actions—tracing waterlines, unbinding the violin despite fear. The mendicant's bowl as resonator creates a strong micro-choice that reveals values. Internal contradiction between fear of shattering peace and need for sound plays out in scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's contradictory impulses—affectionate detachment versus emerging empathy—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in the grotto's transformation moment where she experiences genuine understanding. The final choice to "leave that space respectfully open" is earned through prior causality with visible cost (abandoning perfected deception). Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("affectionate detachment") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characters are well-motivated with clear internal conflict—Aris's calculation softening to empathy, Elena's grief transforming to purpose. The closure choice is earned through prior causality (Mateo's unacknowledged heroism, Aris's debt). Deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("his shrewdness softening into empathy") and slightly convenient emotional progression in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation—the "luminescent ache" to belong—is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, particularly her decision to join the search and create the final sculpture. The revelation that Weaver is the community itself earns her transformation from outsider to "thread in its enduring weave," with visible cost in her vulnerability and three days of labor.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and builds through the pendant's increasing heat and her grandmother's cryptic dying words. The character makes a decisive choice to disrupt the cadence and borrow time, with visible exhaustion as cost. Internal conflict between frustration at the "wrong" rhythm and determination to act creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around time-sculpting that edges toward conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action with the glass eyes revealing emotional spectra. The connection between her brother's ambiguous loss and the orchard's silence creates genuine internal contradiction. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "mathematics of emotion" that occasionally drifts toward conceptual rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (calloused fingertips, sense memory of grandfather) and drives a specific choice with visible cost—she gives up the tape rather than keeping it for herself. The internal contradiction between invisibility and the need to be seen plays out through concrete action, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("quiet, persistent need").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's contradictory impulses between control and surrender act simultaneously throughout, particularly in her "circuitously sincere" interactions with plants. The final renunciation of control is fully earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her identity shift from "director" to "witness." Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("negotiating terms") but the embodied details and specific gestural work compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's exhausted artistic obsession drives consistent choices from following rain trails to seeking Havel, with contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) acting simultaneously. The final shift from painting wars to sketching renewal shows earned change through accumulated discovery, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("wryly earnest belief that art could sieve truth").

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's internal transformation from prediction-focused to presence-focused is well-earned through concrete struggle with the cave pearl. The contradiction between her gift failing and discovering a deeper sight creates genuine tension. However, some moments veer into abstract articulation ("magnify the everyday magic") rather than fully embodied experience, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and builds from sacred duty to personal mission, with the vision sequences showing contradictory impulses (preserve vs. hearten). The final choice to become an anonymous herald is earned through accumulated visions, though the "ocean-spray archivist" title feels slightly ornamental rather than character-defining.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation builds causally from mapper's obsession to personal reckoning, with concrete embodied details like "pulse hammered with trembling certainty." The final choice to confess his buried guilt is earned through prior discovery, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("numbing his grief with ink and paper").

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's skepticism-to-belief arc is earned through visceral memory-sharing with the whales, and her final choice to risk community standing carries visible cost. The internal contradiction between duty and disbelief operates throughout, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aeon's immortal ennui and desperate motivation are well-established, with concrete embodiment ("sediment in bones"). His choice to sacrifice the fragment shows genuine cost and earned transformation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around dimensional awareness that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - using honest calculation to save her dishonest father. The internal contradiction between inherited brilliance and moral integrity creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical, and Agent Reynolds' transformation lacks sufficient psychological grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "collect the textures of different times" drives concrete action through the lamp-charting method, with contradictory impulses (desperation vs. "incandescent restraint") acting simultaneously. The tear response shows embodied emotion under pressure. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "profound, aching connection" without more specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to reconstruct erased histories through fragment collection is clear and consistent, with internal contradiction between their own erasure and quest for truth. The final choice to become "archivist of the unspoken" carries visible cost through their nameless existence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("texture of memories") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's motivation crystallizes clearly through his grief for Elara and drives genuine discovery. His transformation from skeptic to embracing "beautiful, necessary void" feels earned through concrete interaction with the cello and shell. Internal contradiction between his myth-busting nature and reverence for Elara creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("the hollow ache in his chest") but the embodied grief through handling objects compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict that drives his final choice to help the community reorganize. His "culture shock absorber" role perfectly positions him to mediate this crisis, though some interiority edges toward explanatory rather than embodied ("Hope warred with desperation" feels slightly abstract).

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (chemical timer setup, sand grain ritual), with his melancholy mirroring the crater's fate. The character feels authentic in his scientific precision and elegiac purpose, though internal contradiction could be sharper. His final choice to "not look back" carries emotional weight but lacks the visceral cost of higher-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes every choice, with tactile problem-solving embodied through water refraction. The gift-for-daughter motivation arrives late but lands with emotional weight. Minor deduction for limited internal contradiction during the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's dry wit and methodical confidence remain consistent throughout, with clear motivation rooted in her decade-long quest. The internal contradiction between her scientific certainty and underlying worry creates authentic tension. However, the resolution lacks embodied emotional cost—her discovery reads more as intellectual satisfaction than visceral triumph after risking everything.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her methodical mapping of silence and patient demonstration of rhythm. The internal logic holds—she understands the town's collapse as rhythmic discord rather than mere physical decay. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "resonance between land and people" which could use more visceral grounding in the early sections.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied desperation with "trembling hand" and physical details of oxygen depletion. The instinct to flee versus forced stillness creates genuine internal conflict. Motivation clearly tracks from survival need through discovery to application, though the priestess memories feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited trauma, with concrete embodied emotion ("pressed his ear to the cold iron bars"). The internal conflict between escape and truth-telling creates genuine tension. However, the magical hovering element feels unmotivated by character psychology, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong contradictory impulses act in scene—Silas both needs and dreads the ghost's help, knowing each use costs her essence. The ghost's motivation is elegantly complex: repaying a debt through "lovingly venomous" touch that heals and harms simultaneously. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("heart aching") rather than pure embodiment, but the final choice lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes beautifully through the shard discovery, moving from passive tracing to active weaving. The sleepwalkers' unconscious preservation and the fisherman's tearful recognition create genuine emotional complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hauntingly optimistic pull") but the embodied weaving action and bleeding fingers ground the character arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - from practicing phrases to patient wandering to meticulous restoration work. Her "warmly curious" demeanor manifests in how she draws out stories from locals. The final choice to restore the sundial carries visible emotional cost (Kael's tears) and foreclosed path (no longer "adrift").

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation to find meaning in margins drives concrete choices—kneeling to decode chalk, rushing to the kiosk, inscribing the pseudonym with ritual care. The revelation about "Elias Vale" as both shield and plea shows layered internal complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("futuristic nostalgia," "analog soul") that briefly pulls from embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's disguise as a "harmless, scatterbrained embroiderer" creates consistent internal contradiction between performed foolishness and sharp tactical thinking, with embodied tension in deliberate fumbling while tracking guards. The final choice to risk transmission shows clear cost (exposure/death), though the emotional aftermath could deepen beyond relief.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("the wound in her palm slick with fresh blood, and knew she couldn't last until moonrise without aid"). The final renunciation—choosing to heal rather than change the past—is earned through prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("fierce tenderness") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion through the anesthetic's "cottony embrace" and physical details like "fingers traced the cool, knotted surface." The contradiction between Aris's professional competence and vulnerability lands well. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "lotus-hearted ache" and "shared anxieties" that could be more physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory details (boots sinking, touching ceramic), and her internal journey from hollowness to purpose lands with visible cost. However, the epiphany about painting with light feels slightly unearned—the transition from touching the fresco to remembering her forgotten attribute lacks sufficient causality. The final choice to return daily shows genuine change, though the emotional progression from despair to joy moves too smoothly without sufficient internal contradiction in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from certainty to curiosity is well-motivated through concrete action (striking the nickel) and embodied in her final choice. The internal shift feels earned through the nested awakenings sequence, though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("cage of her own certainty").

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation to guard the "spark of defiance" drives consistent choices from cipher interpretation through garden planting, with embodied tension when he feels "the seed against his thigh." The character's expertise and rogue scholar persona enable the counter-frequency discovery, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("wasn't glory; it was the simple, vital act").

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" drives consistent internal struggle, with embodied emotional states (insomnia as "relentless tidepool," pain dissolving "like sugar in tea"). The transformation from wrestling with wakefulness to achieving peace feels earned through accumulated imagery rather than sudden epiphany, though the character remains somewhat archetypal rather than fully individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (checking orchids, humming lullabies, mending chimes), with visible cost in her "foxglove regret" and exhaustion. The character makes specific micro-choices under pressure (selecting tuning fork, pressing ear to floor) that reveal her values. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary ("beautiful and aching") rather than pure embodiment in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and builds from personal redemption to community restoration, with concrete embodied tension ("fingers trembled...carefully reckless energy"). The internal conflict between caution and urgency drives meaningful micro-choices through each translation vow. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("raw and urgent") rather than fully embodied states in transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's internal conflict between duty to public safety and preservation of sacred ruins creates genuine tension, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (trembling from both fatigue and "the sheer weight of conflicting duties"). The discovery of Elara's hidden solution earns the final choice through clear causality, though the emotional progression could deepen further under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between her forger past and current preservation work drives authentic tension, with embodied details like trembling fingers and the weight on her chest. The final choice to trust Hermes carries earned cost through prior causality. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("the weight of her own deception") and slightly over-articulated self-awareness about trust being "shattered pane she was painstakingly gluing back together."

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear and drives every choice, from studying the logbook to reading the bench's grain. The internal conflict between needing to cross the threshold to find her father versus respecting the "necessary distances" creates genuine tension. The final renunciation (not running forward, bowing instead) is perfectly earned through her realization that "some separations were holy," though some interior passages lean toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction - the "hollow ache" of displacement manifests in her desperate recalibration of lights and clutching of the burnt feather. The shared exhale with Kael delivers earned connection through accumulated loneliness, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("neither of the surface nor truly of the deep").

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her emotional journey from "cheerful gloom" to resolution tracks, but the internal conflict lacks genuine contradiction—she pursues her goal without meaningful hesitation or competing impulses. The final choice to gather seeds feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's analytical precision and creative methodology are well-embodied through concrete actions like calculating variables and arranging debris. Her motivation is clear and consistent. However, the internal experience remains somewhat observational rather than contradictory—she watches her plan unfold without significant internal tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to create forbidden art despite exile is clear and consistent, with embodied details like "fingers trembled not with fatigue but with the weight of the unspoken." The spontaneous anchoring creates genuine physical constraint that forces adaptation. However, the character lacks internal contradiction during the ritual itself—her resolve never wavers despite the danger, missing the simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between hollow spectacle and meaningful craft drives authentic tension through embodied details like "hands, usually steady with lead came and silver solder, felt restless." The transformation from seeking to understanding value in mundane repair work is earned through the stone-throwing ritual, though the epiphany edges toward over-articulation in places.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kai's internal journey from guilt to resolve is well-motivated through concrete details (the porcelain box, Elara's lost trust). The contradiction between his firefighter competence and parental failure creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract enlightenment sequence that briefly loses embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" drives consistent, escalating choices through concrete trial-and-error experimentation. Her internal contradiction between logical certainty and emotional vulnerability manifests in action, particularly when she discovers hope requires "shared vulnerability, not solitary strength." The final equation "hope = (courage × connection) ÷ isolation²" emerges from dramatized struggle rather than epiphany, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak ("revitalized her purpose").

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and character-specific (hearing whispers in stone), with embodied perception throughout. The final choice to carry forward Thorne's message shows earned change with visible cost. However, Thorne exists only as discovered material rather than active pressure, and some interiority slides toward diagnostic label-speak ("spiritual fracture," "legacy's burden").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—using borrowed heartbeats to anchor visions in warmth. Her necessary calm under pressure ("panic fractured light") shows embodied stakes. The widower's sharp intake of breath and tears create genuine emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "possibilities" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between rigid protocol adherence and the need for vulnerability drives the closure choice effectively. The "operatively gentle" restraint and ritual grounding create embodied specificity. Deduction for occasional diagnostic language ("exhaustion of decades," "ghosts of countless failed talks") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to admit culpability lands with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thorne's contradictory impulses—ruthless profit calculus versus sentimental preservation—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in his tender placement of the egg while knowing it won't hatch. The final renunciation is earned through specific memory (the boyhood feather) and embodied action, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("amoral philanthropist").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation burns with clarity from the opening, and her embodied actions—fingers tracing threads, spine arching as "living sonnet"—reveal character through physicality rather than labels. The "chaste courtesan" contradiction works as genuine internal tension, not ornamental paradox. Minor deduction for the mother's voice backstory feeling slightly convenient, though it does anchor her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's internal contradiction between being an ethical storyteller and potential manipulator drives genuine conflict, with embodied details like the stick's weight and the dome's chill. The final realization about revealing the strings feels earned through prior struggle, though some interiority veers toward over-articulation ("the clarity of understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation as an "esoteric realist" finding truth in overlooked details is embodied through concrete actions—building cairns, knotting the moth wing. Her internal state during the wing's loss ("heart hammering against her ribs") and transformation ("tears tracing silent paths") shows authentic emotional progression with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her lost wax casting expertise as metaphor for preservation through sacrifice. The snowmelt ardor and forgiveness backstory effectively anchor her drive without over-explaining. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak around forgiveness ("quiet ground from which her purpose finally grew") but the embodied craft details and specific named voices (Anya, Kael, Liora) ground the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's temporal condition creates genuine internal conflict through simultaneous perception of past/future, embodied in concrete moments like "gritting her teeth against the ethereal pull."

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his devotion to cosmic truth over human power, with embodied tension in his "calloused hands" and physical interaction with the tile. The character's frugality as philosophical stance rather than mere poverty adds depth. However, the emotional arc relies on telling ("Tears pricked his eyes") rather than embodied complexity, and the final revelation lacks internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's scheming pacifism manifests through concrete tactical choices (the music box gambit, calculated silence) with clear cost at closure when Kael releases his resentment. The cellular memory concept creates genuine internal contradiction as Kael fights then surrenders to buried peace. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("release wasn't surrender but reclaiming") in exposition rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is grounded in concrete loss (grandfather's stroke, broken sextant) and her internal conflict between practical craft and impossible longing plays out through embodied frustration and eventual surrender to Silas's method. The transformation from solitary struggle to shared rhythm feels earned, though Silas remains more functional than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to preserve generational wisdom drives consistent choices, especially in using the ribbon as both practical solution and emotional bridge.

However, Liora's convenient arrival and immediate understanding feels slightly unearned despite the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's bewilderment manifests through embodied reactions ("disbelief tightening his throat") and his progression from "brightened disquiet" to "focused calm" to "starlit peace" tracks a genuine arc. The philosophical breakthrough in the lavatory shows internal contradiction between following Archive directives and pursuing understanding. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly rushed, and the transformation from bewilderment to peace could use more intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation burns clear and her sacrifice of hoarded knowledge demonstrates genuine cost, but the time traveler Kael lacks development beyond plot function. The "carefully resourceful" trait manifests through concrete choices like using preserved spores and selecting which truth to surrender. Internal conflict peaks when she must pay the mountain's price, though Kael's skepticism feels perfunctory rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's motivation to find her vanished sister is clear and drives every choice, with embodied details like "fingers stained with salt and something less tangible." The "blissfully aberrant calm" creates authentic contradiction under pressure. However, the character lacks a meaningful internal struggle beyond the search itself—no competing impulses act simultaneously in scene, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's "warmly methodical" nature manifests through concrete actions (tracing fibers with ink-stained fingers, counting strands).

Minor deduction for slight emotional flattening during the peak weaving sequence where embodied tension could heighten.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing maps, examining ice patterns) with visible exhaustion and desperate need for peace.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear—proving cosmic pattern through beacon restoration—with embodied emotion ("tears cutting paths through dust"). Her retrocognitive visions create genuine internal conflict between past beauty and present ruin. The final choice to twist the shard carries visible cost through her physical collapse, though some interior phrasing edges toward the abstract ("thistle-blown hope fluttering in her chest").

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her sacred duty as archivist, with concrete embodied actions (tracing stone, pressing palm to crystal). The internal tension between preserving others' memories while experiencing "preemptive nostalgia" for her own fleeting moments creates genuine contradiction. However, the character lacks a decisive choice or renunciation that would elevate to higher bands - she continues her established role without meaningful cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation through grief and guilt drives credible choices, with the chant "Step. Breathe. See." embodying her coping mechanism effectively.

Minor deduction for some abstract philosophizing about time that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia drives concrete choices throughout—fleeing upward, collecting silences, ultimately transforming her offering into growth. The contradiction between her need for space and her father's protective suffocation creates genuine tension, though some interior passages edge toward over-articulation ("contracted with purpose").

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation to transform trauma into healing through acoustic calibration is clear and embodied through concrete actions. His internal state shows through the storm glass vial's responses and his methodical adjustments, though some emotional transitions feel slightly summarized ("not from pain, but release").

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like coaxing paint layers and deciphering glyphs. Her choice to become witness rather than ruler feels earned through her understanding that "the throne remained unclaimed not from lack of worthy heirs, but because its power demanded a keeper who honored both future and past." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in internal realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect the living by severing connections while teaching release to trapped spirits shows clear internal contradiction acted in scene. The final choice to burn bridges "one suffocating soul at a time" demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost—her increasing isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a pyramid scheme survivor who transforms exploitation into diamonds is concrete and drives her final action. The contradictory impulse between helping others and her "virtuously mischievous" theft creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("predatory rhythm of the pitch") but the embodied final choice of slamming the lever earns its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystalline and embodied through tactile exploration of the ledger and crank handle. The contradiction between "dynasty ender" and truth-seeker creates genuine tension.

    Elara's grief-to-purpose arc is earned through concrete discovery, with contradictory impulses (mechanical duty vs. curiosity) acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is grounded in his sister's erasure, creating clear internal stakes that drive every choice. His shift from "quiet fury" to active resistance through the lagoon transmission shows earned progression with visible cost. The characterization falters slightly with some tell-heavy passages ("carefully resourceful") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and grounded in inherited duty, with embodied tension between obligation and isolation effectively rendered through his ritualistic preparation and memory of his grandfather. The protagonist's internal state manifests through concrete actions—the "practiced, reverent slowness" of assembly, the strategic use of silence as weapon—though the piece lacks deeper internal contradiction beyond duty versus burden.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions, with the spirit's traumatic confession creating genuine emotional complexity.

The contradiction between public dismissal ("mere superstition") and her grandmother's reverence creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystalline—reimagining civilization through understanding rather than dogma—and her internal contradiction between revolutionary past and present regret creates genuine tension. The moment with the shard demonstration shows her values hierarchy clearly, choosing proof over ideology with visible cost. Slight deduction for some abstract phrasing ("poetic soul drowned in burnished sorrow") that approaches label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation burns clear—reclaiming stolen light to preserve the city's harmonic balance. The covenant of rust creates genuine constraint, with physical oxidation as the price of falsehood.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's progression from scientific petrichor collector to someone who surrenders measurement for mystery is earned through concrete psychometric revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through retrocognitive invasions that create genuine stakes. The contradiction between his scholarly solemnity and desperate urgency works well.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's rejection of false comfort drives a genuine internal conflict between accepting illusions and building from reality, with his final choice to conceive rather than wish carrying visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied dread ("blood turned to ice") and the contradictory impulse between preserving humanity and cataloging its death rattle. The childhood memory functions as active characterization, revealing his lifelong linguistic gift.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory details ("mittened hands parting the ice-rimed ferns," "heart hammered a war-drum rhythm"). The "furiously tranquil" state shows genuine internal contradiction acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between protocol and intuition drives authentic tension, with embodied doubt ("cold metal a familiar weight against her doubt").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation to preserve unspoken words is clear and consistent, with the covenant duty providing causal pressure. The ghost child's appearance creates a micro-choice moment where Silas recommits to his role.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—the urn fragment physically freezing time, the gear warm to touch—creating genuine urgency around understanding "time's texture."

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete details like her "worn notebook" and daily ritual. Her internal conflict between seeking perfection and finding beauty in fragments plays out through action.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from crisis actor to genuine survivor drives clear motivation, with her trauma and mission creating authentic internal conflict. The encounter with her rescuer forces a concrete choice between maintaining emotional distance and acknowledging truth, paid through the unbinding ritual.

The internal conflict between doubt ("Uncertain alchemist that she was") and determination creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation is crystal clear—navigating grief through purpose—and their patchwork body serves as embodied history of past salvage runs.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—seeking isolation from empathy while being compelled to truth—create genuine tension throughout. Her transformation from seeking personal relief to inadvertently healing Hemlock demonstrates earned character change with visible cost. The truth compulsion functions as both burden and gift, making her final acceptance psychologically complex.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("fingers knotted from decades of salt and wind") and clear motivation rooted in the borrowed memories phenomenon.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clearly rooted in loneliness and his grandfather's promise, with concrete embodiment through physical details like "heart hammering against his ribs."

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's disenchantment and subsequent transformation through memory (daughter's hand, fireflies with Lyra) drives genuine change with visible cost. The contradictory impulses—weariness versus duty, despair versus love—act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she draws on the "shared exhale" memory to command the bleeding starlight. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "commanding" the cosmic wound rather than more embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's transformation from seeking to capture presence to accepting its ephemerality is well-motivated through embodied struggle with the vials and shell. The moment "She saw her error: she sought to preserve the pain, not the connection it revealed" earns the shift. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("density of presence") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously throughout—the "feral nostalgia" that both sustains and devours, the jealousy toward past selves while chronicling dreams. The final transformation from jealousy to acknowledgment ("I see you. I miss you.") carries genuine emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("chronologically confused dread") but embodied emotion dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)

    Kael's crystallization affliction provides strong embodied emotion and internal conflict, with the physical transformation serving as both obstacle and eventual path to resolution. The character's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("scars could be ink, his crystallizing affliction not a curse but a compass"). The transformation from paralyzed scholar to empowered storyteller is earned through specific action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's guilt-driven motivation earns through specific betrayal backstory, and her transition from gossip columnist to spirit exorcist shows layered characterization. The reconciliation choice carries visible cost—accepting imperfection rather than seeking absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to unify cosmic fragments and expose deception is clear and drives his methodical journey. The internal journey spiraling inward while walking outward shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation to understand clocks beyond mere hours drives authentic internal conflict, embodied through the key's vibration and his physical strain while squinting.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to abandon duty for curiosity feels abrupt without sufficient internal conflict dramatized before the choice.

    Silas's cultivated estrangement creates genuine internal contradiction—he connects while maintaining distance, teaching endings while refusing attachment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)

Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("desperate hope ignite") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's blindness and grief create genuine contradictory impulses—fighting versus accepting the current—that culminate in her earned realization that the stillpoint must be "forged in the act of seeking." The sensory-based navigation and emotional embodiment through ultrasonic vibrations absorbed through skin avoid stock phrasing. Minor deduction for the brother's convenient pre-death journal hints and the slightly rushed emotional resolution in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt over the terraforming disaster, with her "confidently uncertain resolve" manifesting through concrete actions like carefully editing gravitational waves.

Minor deduction for Kael's somewhat convenient appearance/disappearance pattern, though his presence creates necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation coheres well through "volcanic tenderness" and guardian identity, with her final choice to become the archive's keeper earned through prior causality. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract ("tears blurring her vision") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the emotional progression from discovery to acceptance lacks the messiness of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear and intensifies through concrete embodied actions—the drumming as coded communication, the desperate attempt to sustain Lyra's presence. The contradictory impulses (hope vs. grief, rebellion vs. clinical compliance) act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she pours "every ounce of her will" while the machines shriek warnings. The final cost—being left "utterly still" and "alone again with the machines"—is earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions—his ability to identify gaits drives key tactical choices (mimicking the electrician's walk, the injured crane operator's shuffle). The internal consistency holds as he uses whisper-precision against shouts, though the final revelation lacks emotional complexity beyond validation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The guardian's motivation emerges through embodied action rather than declaration, with her "spiralingly calm" movements creating genuine tension against the child's despair. The child's transformation from "shoulders shaking with silent sobs" to "fragile wonder" is earned through witnessed action, though the guardian remains somewhat archetypal rather than individually complex.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied perception of students' "silent anxieties" and drives concrete rebellion choices. The final moment with the girl and wooden pawn demonstrates earned character change through specific gesture. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("forests of second thoughts") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied transformation with contradictory impulses ("combative tenderness") acting simultaneously in the climactic moment. The final choice to embrace her sea nature is earned through prior causality—years of denial, physical markers (gills, healing), and the scrimshaw's unlocking—with visible cost in abandoning her land life. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("true nature") in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is grounded in specific loss (daughter's death, dried bouquet as anchor) with embodied grief management through theatrical narration of mundane tasks. The internal contradiction between mandated happiness and authentic grief drives consistent micro-choices. Minor deduction for Mrs. Gable reading slightly stock as the compliance enforcer.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to prove boundaries are illusions of fear—and drives her concrete actions throughout. The internal certainty that "surged through her" effectively embodies her conviction, though the piece relies heavily on abstract declarations ("The boundary is a wound") rather than showing internal contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander's motivation is grounded in his colorblindness creating genuine limitation, and his "innocently cunning" manipulation of the plant language shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final awakening lands with earned cost—he trades his most precise tool for transformation. Minor deduction for Elara's underdeveloped pressure beyond functional opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her calloused hands and quest to recover lost connection through sound. The final choice to ring the bell after years of silence carries visible cost and transforms her understanding from seeking restoration to accepting absence as presence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of connection" that occasionally drifts toward concept rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from crafting death memorials to cultivating life is earned through concrete actions—scattering origami with coordinates, embedding seeds in glass orbs, illuminating the curtains. Her internal contradiction between grief and the fragile "subdued ardor" plays out through embodied choices, though some emotional transitions could be more granular.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation as cultural archaeologist using cartomancy is clear and compelling, with concrete embodiment through measuring tape precision (17.3 cm between cards). Maya provides effective pressure that forces Elara to articulate her method. Minor deduction for slight emotional flattening in Elara's steady scholarly tone during Maya's crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like "jagged, stuttering steps" and "clapping once then thrice." The internal conflict between experiencing and scattering memories shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("atoms of nostalgia") that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her method deliberate, with strong interiority around preserving hope's "fragile geometry." The transformation from fighting to accepting the shadow shows genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "hope's shape" which could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong embodied interiority through specific details like "hollow ache in her chest" and the chameleon's "jewel-bright eyes reflecting the lantern light like fractured emeralds." The internal conflict between self-respect and compassion plays out through concrete micro-choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fragile convictions") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("skull throbbing," "lunged from the cot") and layered contradictions (seeking closure through reopening). The transformation from dissecting scars to reading them as testimonies feels earned through accumulated pressure, though the epiphany edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, driven by her need to find where unused love is stored. Her interiority is concrete with embodied perception ("fingers trembling," "cold metal"). However, the emotional progression feels somewhat linear without sufficient internal contradiction during the climactic discovery, and the transformation arrives too smoothly without visible struggle at the moment of transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to free trapped creativity is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing meteor paths with the astrolabe. Her "moonstruck dreamer" characterization manifests in specific perceptual details—hearing unspoken words as feelings, seeing visions of frozen artisans. The final choice to channel her entire being into the tracing gesture shows genuine cost through physical collapse, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—tending spores instead of forcing archive coherence—with his transformation from "dreamless" to dreaming marking genuine change. The internal conflict between preserving dead data versus cultivating new life plays out through specific choices, though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like the gear's warmth and her tears cutting through oil. The internal conflict between civilized thought and wild frontier drives meaningful choices, though some moments lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("mistaking control for wisdom"). Her final realization lands with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transformation from tethered to free reads clearly through embodied moments like "fumbled in her pocket" and "pressed her palm into the star-shaped hollow." The internal journey coheres, though interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("unused courage waits") rather than concrete sensation. The ferry guides function well as pressure points but lack individuated voices.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in the specific loss of her voice, with embodied details like "nerves hummed with returning life" and the concrete discovery of the piano bolt. The internal conflict between accepting safety's cost versus hoping for recovery plays out through micro-choices, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("the fortress's terrible arithmetic") rather than staying fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong character work with Aris's weathered dignity and Elara's trembling courage earning their pivotal choices. The rune manifesting on Elara's palm feels motivated by her quest to find Aris's messages. Minor deduction for Varek's somewhat stock villainy ("resplendent in ermine and false humility") and his convenient immediate flight without deeper consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing the atlas, tapping rhythms), with authentic scientific obsession driving his investigation. The character arc from urgent searching to resigned understanding lands with cost, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the discovery moment.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—pressing palm to permacrete, using opera glasses to see hidden light patterns. Her "awkwardly confident" trait manifests believably in the threadbare jumpsuit paired with star-mapped dreams. The internal conflict between despair over fallen comrades and determination to find meaning drives genuine character complexity, though the final transformation toward collective awakening feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's insurgent stance emerges through concrete action (unsealing the embryo against tradition) with embodied physical cost (tremors, kneeling on hot basalt). The plant-telepathy creates genuine internal conflict between preserving tradition and evolving it, culminating in a choice that forecloses the old path. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "implanted destiny" and occasional diagnostic language ("honor tradition by changing it").

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's trauma response is viscerally embodied through the freeze state and somatic recovery sequence. The photograph as physical anchor and her deliberate choice to plant despite erosion show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in "penance and purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes organically from artist's block through fire trauma to the decision to "honor fragments." The internal contradiction between perfectionism and accepting brokenness plays out through embodied action with the threads. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("hollowed-out heart") but the final choice to descend without a lantern demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is grounded in the brother's death and drives every action toward understanding crisis-time. Her "serene anger" manifests believably through controlled scientific pursuit rather than emotional outburst. The forced recall of trauma ("scalding brake lines") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("glacier calving within her chest") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between duty and truth drives meaningful choices with visible cost. Her motivation is clear and consistent, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("bravely conflicted") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to release the letter and hide shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's pacifist stance against her violent heritage creates genuine internal conflict, particularly when she chooses to sheathe rather than draw the dagger. The micro-choice to use the sandbag scrap as protective mulch reveals her values hierarchy under pressure. However, the raiders' too-convenient retreat without further testing her resolve slightly undermines the earned cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is deeply rooted in communal need (village children's stolen sleep) and drives increasingly desperate actions through the sonic chaos. His cool-headed nature holds under extreme pressure, though the internal experience could be more contradictory—he remains perhaps too composed during the garden's violent unraveling. The final moment of kneeling in "true silence" shows earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara's motivation builds cleanly from firing Ben for "reckless idealism" (now "ash in her mouth") through the contradiction proof to her final action breaking her "orbit of regret." The internal conflict between corporate caution and journalistic courage manifests in concrete choices, though peak emotional embodiment could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's guilt-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (tracing tattoo, touching amber, creating the tether) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—needing to silence the cry yet needing to hear it. The final choice to channel rather than erase the dissonance shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("the old guilt they'd carried") in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete choices through sand mandala creation, though internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than shown in simultaneous impulses. The transformation from individual uncertainty to collective understanding earns its cost through the specific act of reshaping chaos into order. Social perceptiveness manifests in noticing tension but could deepen through more embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's gentle radicalism manifests through embodied contradiction—his "arms of steel" protecting fragile memories while his fingers trace fractures with tenderness. The retrocognitive vision creates genuine internal conflict between revealing dangerous truth and preserving simple narratives. His final choice to restore the plaza's name carries visible cost as he risks Council opposition, though the emotional progression could deepen further in the confrontation with Varr.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's synesthetic perception ("taste the metallic tang of fractured seconds") creates a distinctive character lens, and her choice to save the child over self-preservation lands with emotional weight. The internal contradiction between her desperation and purpose drives the narrative effectively, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("lure possibility from the brink of despair").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Aris's motivation is clear and grounded in professional failure turned scientific discovery, with embodied stress ("static shock still buzzed in Aris Thorne's molars"). The shift from "affectionate skeptic" to determined investigator feels earned through the somatic discovery. Minor deduction for Lena's underdeveloped role beyond supportive presence and for some diagnostic language ("somatic markers") that could be more embodied in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal journey from isolation to connection is well-motivated through concrete sensory details and the fossil's transitional function. The contradiction between scientific method and "factual mysticism" creates genuine tension. However, emotional embodiment relies too heavily on stock phrases ("panic clawed at her throat," "tears blurred her vision") and the final epiphany feels slightly unearned given the limited on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation burns clear from the opening—transforming prophecy from doom to possibility—and this drive intensifies through concrete discovery with the buttons-as-coordinates revelation. The internal contradiction between honoring her mentor's wisdom while forging a new path creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional resolution ("tears pricked her eyes") that could have shown more embodied struggle at the moment of breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clearly rooted in redemption both professional and personal, with concrete embodied details like "the stone in his chest" and specific micro-choices under pressure. The internal contradiction between his burned status and desperate hope drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("fixing what's broken") and occasional emotional summary rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's characterization succeeds through embodied expertise—his bone-deep knowledge of the river manifests in micro-adjustments and the mending act. The palimpsest promise layers mother's vow with present vigilance effectively. Minor deduction for the passengers remaining faceless tokens rather than pressure sources.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaito's motivation is clear and rooted in his potter's understanding of persistence through fire, with concrete embodied details like "dusted with clay" and "breathing slow and deep." His internal conflict between witnessing and participating plays out through micro-choices (placing the stone offering, carrying the glass). The final choice to carry the fragment "not to fix it, but to hold its lesson" shows earned wisdom with visible cost—he accepts the weight of memory rather than attempting restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in witnessing "too many alley shadows swallow the desperate," with her methodical glass-planting revealing character through concrete action. The "wistfully pragmatic" tension manifests in her acceptance of the rose's death while defying darkness through deliberate light-work. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("protected vulnerability wasn't an oxymoron here; it was the truth of growth"), and the cat appears more as thematic device than genuine complication.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief—screaming until throat bleeds, ice-shard memories in blood—with her final transformation from isolation to vessel earning its cost through the Aethon's dissolution sacrifice. The contradictory impulse between preserving sanity and honoring the extinct plays out physically in the descent to the stone circle, though some interiority edges toward explanatory rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from hollow vessel to active creator is well-earned through concrete action, with visible cost in her vulnerability ("I want to belong"). The shift from ghostwriting others' emotions to creating genuine connection shows clear internal contradiction resolved through embodied choice. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("curated connections") and the thrush's overly neat approval, but the core arc lands with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (tracing charts, adjusting equipment, calculating frequencies), with internal conflict between hope and desperation. The final choice to face the crowd with proof shows earned agency, though emotional complexity could deepen beyond the cautious hope/determination binary.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like "heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird," and her internal conflict between prudence and adventure plays out in micro-choices. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat predetermined, and the final reflection about "mutinies born of longing" arrives without sufficient dramatization to fully earn this insight.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's prosopagnosia creates genuine contradiction between her role as portrait artist and inability to recognize faces, driving methodical compensation strategies. Her motivation to awaken dormant empathy emerges through concrete ritual actions at the quarry. The witness's emotional breakthrough ("I forgot how much she mattered") lands with earned cost, though his convenient appearance strains causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is consistently rooted in familial shame and idealistic conviction, with concrete embodied details like "fingers sticky with the spongey dread" and "the knot of nervously confident resolve." The internal contradiction between nervous uncertainty and confident determination plays out through action, though the resolution insight arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fiddler's motivation is crystal clear—transforming his "never" verdict through the discovery of pixelated amnesty—and his contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. hope) play out through concrete actions like offering the glass flake and following the coded path. The hitchhiker functions effectively as catalyst but lacks depth beyond his symbolic role. The final choice to play again despite damaged hands shows genuine cost and earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior complexity with Elias's contradictory impulses (flee vs. stay, repeat vs. break free) acting simultaneously in scene, particularly in his methodical marking ritual that reveals values through micro-choices. The earned renunciation of escape patterns carries visible cost in accepting the circular paths rather than fighting them.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to decode temple inscriptions before monsoon rains provides clear urgency, and her internal conflict between solitary burden and communal understanding drives meaningful change. The dream sequence reveals contradictory impulses through embodied detail ("heart hammering," "tears pricked"), though some moments drift toward therapeutic insight ("healing began when burdens were distributed") rather than staying in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt over stealing the heart-seed, driving his actions throughout. His "warlike serenity" under pressure and methodical search through expanding circles reveal consistent character traits. The resolution—accepting the truth of his past actions—represents earned change with visible cost. However, interiority lacks embodied contradiction during peak stress, relying on labels like "warlike serenity" rather than showing internal conflict through action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's root-bound state creates genuine physical and emotional constraint that drives every choice, with contradictory impulses (freedom vs. duty) acting simultaneously throughout. The final shift from bondage to communion is earned through her blood sacrifice and the covenant's reweaving, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("anxious elation" repeats as label).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's reckless idealism drives genuine stakes through her bartered destiny, with contradictory impulses ("fiercely gentle") embodied in concrete actions like tending the burned card while carving binding symbols. The final choice to accept root-binding shows earned cost, though some interiority edges toward overwrought ("the silence where her brother's laughter should be was a wound that festered in the marrow").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior contradiction between Liam's need to insulate with facts and his visceral longing for belonging drives the narrative. The moment where he stops insulating and allows the grille cloth's true meaning to surface shows genuine internal conflict acting in scene. His final choice to keep the cloth rather than appraise it as "minimal value" carries visible cost—professional duty versus personal truth.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's methodical patience and scholarly obsession create genuine tension between intellectual achievement and emotional longing. His internal contradiction—pursuing technical understanding while yearning for spiritual connection—drives authentic choices. The final moment where he touches the glass, "forever living in the space where revelation and longing met," earns its emotional weight through consistent characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve stories is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks dramatic embodiment—the moon's influence on her focus is told rather than shown through degraded perception or concrete mistakes. The contradiction between duty and weariness exists conceptually but doesn't manifest in scene-level choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris's transformation from clinical detachment to emotional connection is well-motivated through concrete discovery of the pearl's confessions, with his professional distance dissolving as a clear cost. The internal contradiction between duty and empathy acts simultaneously in scene when he chooses not to sign the order. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("suffocating accumulation of despair") rather than embodied perception, and the emotional progression feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong interior contradiction between methodical documenting and emotional surrender drives the arc, with embodied grief ("tears nourished his spirit's dry soil"). The transformation from control to flow is earned through concrete struggle with the accordion and graffiti wisdom. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("self-forgiveness") not fully dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation burns with concrete specificity—documenting the path to the Library of Unspoken Words while navigating with a stolen reversed watch. Her cautious exuberance manifests through embodied details (breath fogging veil, watch warm against palm) and contradictory impulses (hope balanced against eerie light). The character choice at closure—risking collapse for the final delay measurement—demonstrates earned stakes through accumulated pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between preserving the Verdant Court's vision and surrendering to the empire manifests through concrete choices, particularly in the garden propagation sequence. The plant telepathy creates genuine contradictory impulses (the cereus's warnings versus her need to act). However, the emotional arc from "mulberry ache" to acceptance feels slightly rushed in the final beats, and Vorlag exists more as function than character.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling—preserving humanity's last spark before oblivion—with concrete embodiment through trembling fingers and surgical precision. The internal tension between grief and purpose drives her actions credibly. However, Kael remains purely passive, and some phrasing edges toward the abstract ("radiant hush," "threshold of stillness") without sufficient grounding in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through embodied details like adjusting the hairpin while working, though her internal journey from forgiveness to contentment relies on reflective summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The moment of realization ("contentment wasn't a destination but the act of tending") arrives through epiphany rather than earned struggle, and the sister remains an abstract memory without present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between selling certainty while "starving his own soul of nuance" drives authentic tension. The embodied moment of removing the cloak lands with physical vulnerability ("sharp and real, touched his neck"). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("conscience for hire" concept) that could be more grounded in sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The backwards aging concept creates distinctive embodiment but lacks internal contradiction in scene - Elara's transformation reads as observed phenomenon rather than lived struggle. The withholding motivation is clear but Kael remains functional furniture. The resolution arrives through passive observation rather than earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harmonic stone skimmer's motivation to "navigate without moving" drives consistent choices through stone-skimming, pattern-reading, and ultimately releasing the arrowhead. His weathered physicality and reverent patience embody decades of pursuit, with the final renunciation (returning the arrowhead) foreclosing his path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (scraping frost, mist walking, pressing the keystone). The internal contradiction between her former status and current obsolescence drives genuine tension. However, the epiphany about "the sacred in the simple" arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient dramatized struggle in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's synesthetic quest drives consistent motivation through concrete sensory details and embodied discovery. His transformation from routine lamplighter to seeker of luminous truth lands with earned cost when he absorbs the color of courage. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in emotional processing ("he lived it") rather than fully embodied sensation at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's progression from "stellar doubt" to certainty through concrete discovery of harmonic alignment shows clear motivation. The coins' shift from divination tools to tuning instruments demonstrates character evolution through action. Interiority remains specific ("doubt gnawed," "bones vibrating") without therapy-speak, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's grief-driven motivation is embodied through tactile interaction with the atlas and crystals, with contradictory impulses (reaper's detachment vs. personal loss) acting simultaneously. The final choice to name fears honors Kael's sacrifice with visible cost—transforming her internal void "from abyss to gathering space." Minor deduction for some abstract emotional language ("shattered her," "wound that never closed") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's "lukewarm" magical limitation creates genuine constraint that shapes his patient, measurement-based approach throughout. His brittle devotion manifests in concrete action—pressing palms to bronze, matching breathing to rhythm—rather than declaration. The earnest naivety drives his isolation ("colleagues had laughed") and his persistence despite mockery, creating authentic character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("clutching the cold glass shard") and a meaningful change from vigilant warden to keeper of memory. The revelation about the lost aunt creates genuine emotional complexity. Minor deduction for slightly convenient emotional processing in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between logic and intuition drives meaningful action, with the locket providing concrete embodiment of her "secretly sentimental" nature. The starlings trigger genuine realization that changes her approach to the crystal. However, the epiphany feels slightly rushed, and her emotional progression from tears to triumph lacks intermediate complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her expertise credible, with good embodied stress ("sweat stung her eyes"). However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("watcher's burden," "trust preserved") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character functions competently but lacks the depth of genuine internal conflict during the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's motivation to defeat numbness through the custody battle is clear and embodied through concrete gestures like placing his hand on the jar. However, the emotional transformation from numbness to feeling relies on abstract "channeling" and "weaving" that lacks sufficient embodied specificity in the crucial vivification moment.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "safeguard space for innovation" drives consistent choices throughout, though internal conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied. His receptivity trait enables the seed-planting decision, but emotional stakes stay abstract—we get philosophical musings about innovation rather than visceral struggle. The renunciation of public display for private cultivation qualifies as earned stasis with mild cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation—transforming grief into healing through her wind symphony—is embodied through concrete actions and the "mournfully eager" tension in her shoulders. The contradiction between her mechanical orchestra and tender lullabies creates authentic complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional resolution in her husband and daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from fear-driven guardian to accepting uncertainty is earned through concrete struggle with the pendant. The contradictory impulses between library-defense instinct and homesickness create genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "interiorizing exteriors" that verges on conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation and internal state are well-embodied through "stoically sensitive" contradictions and the concrete detail of failed transmutations.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions, with her philosophy of "finding beginnings in endings" driving her choices. The transformation from filtering signals to tuning herself shows genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around cosmic concepts that could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's motivation to merge timelines is clear and drives concrete actions through radio manipulation and pattern recognition. His "resiliently positive" trait manifests in maintained focus despite the surreal crisis, though internal contradiction could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a fever dream architect seeking "the texture of connection" drives clear, consistent choices throughout. The contradictory impulses between control and discovery play out concretely when she must choose between stopping the eruption or integrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a "contact tracer for hearts" drives consistent choices through concrete embodied details like the hearing aid's warmth and her physical tracking of Agnes's signal. The internal conflict between her role to "assure" versus following Agnes's urgent plea creates genuine tension. However, the convenience of her childhood gift and the slightly neat resolution prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arden's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict acting simultaneously with her mission drive, and her final transformation from "spelunker fighting the dark" to "keeper of echoes" is earned through specific struggle. The embodied fear ("clawing panic," "claustrophobia screamed in her veins") works against her determination effectively, though some interior phrasing edges toward the diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in the visceral act of counting heartbeats as defiance against bureaucratic erasure. Her internal contradiction between seeking wisdom from failure while refusing deletion creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation as the last storyteller is clear and embodied through copper-veined skin and his dedication to translating texture into sound. His internal conflict between hope and the curse's threat creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is grounded in her sister's transformation, and her internal conflict between bitterness and hope drives authentic choices. The metamorphosis is earned through accumulated pressure rather than sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's silent grief and "quiet persistence" manifest through embodied action (calloused fingers, sanding, mending) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—his refusal to name grief while hands continue their work. The singing choice emerges from accumulated pressure and the halo fragment's urging, with visible cost in "tears tracking through the grime." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "interpreting silence not as emptiness but as possibility" which edges toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is consistently rooted in her obsessive quest, with concrete embodiment through the scarf's physical reactions ("tightened against her throat," "fibers vibrating like plucked violin strings").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear—finding her sister through the watercolor cipher—and her obsessive dawn ritual embodies this drive viscerally. The contradiction between hope and absence pulses throughout, particularly in "fossilized tears" and the palette as both gift and haunting reminder. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cipher of longing") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to pursue the lead carries genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris demonstrates clear motivation through her "unassumingly bold nature" and the "improbable longing" that drives her to free courage itself. Her internal state is well-embodied through physical responses to the cosmic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's motivation to recover stolen memories drives clear choices, with embodied emotion ("salt-crusted goggles," "tears blurred Aris's vision") and internal contradiction between believing herself robbed versus the gentler truth. The revelation that the witch was a guardian creates earned change with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some explanatory interiority ("she'd learned, ghosts fester in the cracks") that tells rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's contradictory impulses manifest clearly through her backwards walking and "combative tenderness" toward Kael. The final choice to stop retreating and annotate with Kael's words shows earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation burns clear through embodied detail—her calloused hands, the weight in her heart, her decades of patient tree-wisdom manifest in concrete action. The internal conflict between grief over the last Wonderbloom's death and determination to restore wonder creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the spectral orchard sequence trending toward abstraction rather than maintaining embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's methodical curiosity and perceptive nature drive concrete micro-choices throughout—clearing ivy with a soft brush, overlaying vellum maps, waiting for rain to test her theory. Her "shielded openness" manifests believably as skepticism paired with receptive patience. The emotional progression from analytical distance to tears of connection feels earned through accumulated discoveries rather than sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like "pressure against his chest, heavier than the ocean above." The internal contradiction between his analytical approach to grief and the emotional reality plays out effectively. However, Eleanor appearing as a character through her note strains credibility—how would her message reach this specific sunken ship?

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes believably from silence to connection, with embodied details like "cold on the dew-slicked flagstones" and the bolt plate "biting into her palm." The ghost's characterization as a lonely AI caretaker whose "core directive to protect the city had outlived its purpose" creates genuine pathos. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("tinkersong wonder") that approaches label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from dutiful servant to witness of "something vast and gentle" is earned through concrete discovery and embodied response ("throat tightened," "spirit unmoored").

    Elara's motivation to prove "empty spaces remember" drives consistent choices through the brass telescope observations and cloud categorization. Her internal conflict between scientific methodology and grief creates authentic tension, particularly when she recognizes her father's spiral pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's face blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her tactile approach to the craft, with embodied sensory detail ("fingers reading grooves," "hands...her only reliable guides").

    Elara's motivation is crystal clear and intensifies through concrete discovery, with her "diligently curious" trait driving every action from tracing railings to decoding the hopscotch cipher. The internal conflict between "sociable isolation" and purpose creates genuine tension, and her final tears of purpose show earned emotional progression. Minor deduction for some labeling ("diligently curious" repeated) and slight over-articulation in places, but the core characterization drives the closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—her numb fingers handling gears, her careful listening for the pulse beneath the stall.

    Kael's motivation through desperation and fragile hope drives coherent action, with embodied details like "heart hammered" and breath fogging.

    Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied struggle—trembling fingers, cracking skin, decades aging in seconds—with contradictory impulses (duty vs. despair) acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation—grimly fulfilling an oath while seeking freedom—drives consistent action through the piece. Her internal contradiction between duty and resentment manifests in concrete choices (the precise breath-path assembly), though the final wondering about freedom lacks the embodied cost needed for higher bands. The "offhandedly exact" trait shapes her pruning and path-making with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aris's grief-driven motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing foam patterns, though the epiphany about separation/transformation arrives somewhat abruptly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eliska's motivation to heal disconnection through sound is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing frozen weights and listening to distant groans.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's transformation from engineer to dream archeologist is well-motivated through concrete sensory details ("hands trembled...from the quaking reverie") and embodied emotional responses to the entangled memories.

However, the transformation lacks deeper internal contradiction—she achieves her goal relatively smoothly without significant cost to her beliefs or identity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation to create music in a silent world is viscerally embodied through their physical interaction with the sculpture, and the contradictory impulses of theft versus necessity play out in real-time choices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chess tutor's motivation is rooted in exile's injustice and his refusal to betray principles, with concrete embodiment through the worry stone's dent marking his imperfection.

    Elara's transformation from forcing stillness to finding harmony within motion is earned through concrete struggle with the seed. Her contradictory impulses (ambition vs. serenity) play out in scene through her failed attempts at control, then acceptance of natural rhythm.

    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—magnetized boots, gripping the yoke, navigating by water flow. The transformation from seeking an external source to understanding resilience as "gathered memory" earns its cost through the broken arrow's integration.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in professional duty, with concrete embodied details like the respirator fogging and the patch's cold weight. The internal conflict between scientific precision and human empathy plays out through micro-choices, particularly when she pockets the patch as both evidence and memorial.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's synesthesia drives genuine action through the aurora-guided bell performance, but internal contradiction remains limited to abstract concepts of wonder versus efficiency.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("mathematics of emotion") that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's internal contradiction between fear and duty plays out through embodied emotion (trembling fingers, breath hitching) and culminates in a credible transformation from paralysis to "quiet resolve."

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between seeking "tangible proof" while practicing mysticism creates genuine tension. The shift from certainty to humility is earned through embodied discovery (tears freezing, prism warming), though some moments edge toward diagnostic self-awareness ("her rigid certainty melted into humility").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation remains singular and embodied through concrete detail (amber bead pulsing against skin, sap-sticky fingers). The final choice to channel her essence into the threads shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("separation not as pain, but as release"). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "decades of longing" rather than more specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's meekness transforms through concrete sacrifice—offering his voice to awaken Veridia—with the cost visible in his profound silence replaced by "azure defiance."

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's sensory cartography creates a distinctive character voice, and her contradictory impulses between following Lyra and accepting her sacrifice play out viscerally in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" drives consistent action, but lacks embodied emotional complexity beyond "shadowed elation." The herald exists more as atmospheric device than pressure-generating character. Internal conflict remains abstract ("doubt slithered in") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from active seeker to receptive listener is earned through the donor's journal discovery and her realization about "iridescent caution."

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "magnetizing stories" early on.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's motivation is grounded in quantified grief (427 healing entries, searching for what trees witnessed), with concrete embodiment like "psoriasis tingling as moonlight bathed his arms."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to save her realm through recovering fragmented memory is clear and compelling, with internal contradiction between her scattered mind and urgent purpose. The final choice to sing personal, "too small" songs rather than grand hymns represents earned character insight with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's empathetic nature creates genuine internal contradiction between isolation and connection, with embodied emotional progression from panic to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through embodied contradiction—her hands tremble while she's "heuristically gentle," and her guilt over inaction wars with her guerrilla activism. The locket discovery forces a genuine reckoning with her self-blame, earning the tenuous absolution through accumulated detail rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("tenuous absolution felt impossible") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve meaning against oblivion is clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like calibrating the frequency sampler with trembling fingers.

    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the watch fob's physical presence and her methodical recording attempts. The repeated false starts reveal her "curiously steadfast" persistence under pressure, and her final hollow victory lands with emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's scientific desperation and her transformation from skeptic to understanding create a compelling arc with genuine internal conflict.

    Elara's mnemonic gift creates genuine internal contradiction—perfect recall paired with creative paralysis—that drives embodied choices throughout. The moment she works the lock mechanism with "charcoal-stained fingers surprisingly deft, remembering the exact pressure Grandfather used" shows specificity under pressure. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "unbearable weight of release" in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's truth-sensing curse creates genuine embodied stakes ("wilting deeper as he lied," "spine softening like sun-scorched celery").

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation to recover lost memories is clearly rooted in the tangible wildflowers and drives concrete action through the salt chamber excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through precise ritual actions, though her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The stakes are visceral ("fractured skies and screaming roots"), and her methodical approach reveals character through action. However, the absence of genuine internal struggle or meaningful character change beyond task completion limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens from seeking literal language in buildings to understanding the need for shared fiction against loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation to bridge generations through preserved sounds drives meaningful choices, from the music box discovery to sharing it with the child. His internal contradiction between isolation and yearning for connection creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and stakes are embodied through physical sensation ("dissonance crawling up his spine," "ache in his molars"). The "logically emotional" attribute manifests credibly as Aris calculates while feeling the Tower's pain.

The contradictory impulses (duty vs. personal guilt about failing Elias) act simultaneously in scene, particularly when tears prick his eyes while he smiles, though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("he deserved this moment, this clarity").

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zephyr's steadily curious nature drives consistent choices through escalating pressure, with contradictory impulses (irreverent awe vs. technical precision) acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—breaking rather than ringing the bell—is earned through prior causality with visible cost (twenty years of pursuit inverted). Minor deduction for some diagnostic label-speak ("distilled essence of human longing") but embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with her brother's disappearance driving every choice. The internal conflict between duty to Vance and need to find Leo creates genuine tension. However, Vance's characterization feels thin—his fear and complicity arrive too suddenly without sufficient groundwork, and the revelation "Leo..." lacks earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's shadow-woven nature creates genuine internal tension between empathetic connection and peacekeeper duty, particularly when feeling Kael's grief turn to shame. The reconstitution choice drives from consistent intuitive traits, though some emotional transitions (particularly the clans' instant acceptance) lack intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation evolves from seeking death to understanding endings, with contradictory impulses (flee vs. understand) acting simultaneously in the parasol scene. The fold in patience manifests as embodied surrender rather than abstract concept. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("near-death clarity") but the final choice to listen rather than flee carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("hollow space beneath her ribs"), with genuine internal contradiction between isolation and connection. The final choice to keep the letter as "seed" rather than "relic" shows earned transformation through accumulated observation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract resolution of her vigil's "deeper purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in duty as "the last line walker," with embodied stress shown through physical connection to the sand and parapet vibrations. The internal struggle between acknowledging the clearing's fragility while demanding its strength creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her "strangely honest" trait which lacks specific behavioral manifestation beyond feeling the clearing's emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to transmute suffering into collective healing is consistently dramatized through concrete actions and the photograph arrangements, with her own loss (stillbirth) woven meaningfully into the arc. The supporting cast (Chen, Maria, Gupta) demonstrates authentic transformation through specific paired images showing their journeys from pain to renewal. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("Healing, Elara believed, wasn't solitary") rather than pure embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling—proving words are living things—with embodied details like "ink-stained fingers" and concrete micro-choices around the crystal's use. The character's "weathered innocence" manifests believably through her trust in obsolete books and tearful response to discovery. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("sacred," "weight of witnessing") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to cradle the crystal shows clear value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's contradictory nature as a "precognitively forgetful" prophet creates genuine internal conflict, with his desperate physical actions (scraping chalk, arranging driftwood) embodying his struggle against cognitive dissolution. The final moment where he forgets why he holds chalk while the meaning drains away demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation—seeking escape velocity from grief through capturing ephemeral light—drives consistent choices culminating in his acceptance that harmony with instability, not resistance, enables capture. His internal contradiction between fighting time's passage and preserving fleeting moments resolves through embodied realization when the leaf's sound pierces his despair. The "luminous ache" of loss permeates every technical action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—providing meaningful closure through music therapy—with concrete embodied emotion in Aris's tear, trembling hand tracing melody, and final benediction. The internal conflict between medical protocol and spiritual need drives her "decisively kind" insistence on the rooftop setting. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("sacred space," "healing sometimes meant releasing the breath") in early beats, though the closure moment lands with earned cost through specific physical gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's methodical precision and quiet grief for Varn create genuine internal tension, particularly in her careful rune correction sequence where each scar reveals both technical and emotional stakes. The "quietly deliberate" trait manifests through concrete actions—steady breath, focused economy, painstaking care—rather than labels. Minor deduction for some filter-verb clustering ("She placed," "She selected") and occasional emotional summary ("quiet ache") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from "forgiving skeptic" to wisdom-gardener is earned through concrete particulars - the changeling's tooth discovery, Finn's innocent questions, and the bone-setting metaphor. Internal contradiction plays effectively ("yearned not for the impossible return of stolen time, but for a way to mend"), though some passages lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("She was no longer the woman who demanded proof").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation to honor her grandmother's legacy while serving her earthbound community is clear and consistent. The internal conflict between her lost dreams of observatories and her discovered purpose shows genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from seeking refuge to offering connection is earned through concrete details like tracing the fractal pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's conflicted motivation between collecting/preserving hopes versus learning to witness them creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through micro-choices (tracing with the shell, then stopping). The transformation from forced capture to honoring acceptance is earned through dramatized struggle. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("weight of unwritten endings") and the younger-self cameo feeling slightly convenient, though it pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in multi-generational stakes, with embodied tension ("panic clawed at her throat") and specific micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" manifests through concrete action as she methodically rebuilds the timer while processing grief.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between collecting burdens and bearing her own fractal weaver's curse creates genuine tension.

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "fractal weaver's curse" which could use more concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The widow's grief manifests through embodied contradiction—her hands turning wood while memory pulls backward, creating genuine tension between action and longing. The motivation to "harvest lessons from loss" drives concrete micro-choices: picking up the knife, making the first cut, each stroke a negotiation with absence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hollow space," "contain the storm") that could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation to negotiate with her ghost-self is clear and embodied through concrete scavenging actions, with internal contradiction between erosion and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal journey from pursuing mechanical perfection to accepting imperfection is earned through the bear encounter, with contradictory impulses (fear vs. recognition) acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with internal conflict between her decade-long quest and emerging doubt effectively embodied through concrete actions like kneeling in muck and tracing inscriptions. The transformation from "errant legend seeker" to purposeful truth-dismantler is earned through specific discovery, though some interiority edges toward explanation ("calm understanding rising within the storm of shattered illusions") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving ancient methods drives every action. His infinite patience manifests through methodical decoding and reverent copying. The character achieves meaningful change by successfully decoding the rope's wisdom and binding it to his seeds, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during the process.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—documenting absence while seeking healing—act simultaneously through her projection practice. The final renunciation of external geography for internal mapping is earned through prior embodied details like "pressing the thread to her palm" and feeling "the hollow where his laughter used to reside."

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her skeptical-turned-believer arc, with embodied tension in "tears cutting clean paths through the dust on her cheeks."

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal stakes well-established through concrete details like studying ice cores and constructing predictive models. The character shows genuine struggle between doubt and resolve at the fulcrum moment ("before the pen met the blank page—was the fulcrum where doubt became resolve").

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—transcribing fragments with "trembling ink," whispering to dust "like incantations."

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "emotionally rational" trait manifests in measured urgency, but her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction during key moments.

The transformation from "perpetually surprised" pilot to someone who "belonged" lands with earned cost.

Her patient strategy is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., ignoring wrist pain, steady hands while decoding) and her final renunciation—shielding the seeds with her body—is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's characterization is vivid and specific, with his "thoughtfully spirited" narration revealing a coping mechanism rooted in grief. His motivation to create "safe zones for inquiry" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his choice to abandon the furnace.

The only minor flaw is a slight over-articulation of her motivation in the line "to anchor ideals in practice," which edges toward theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thorne's contradictory impulses—ruthless capitalist and secretly sentimental preservationist—act simultaneously in scene, most powerfully when he kneels to place the egg. His final choice is earned by a prior causality (the memory of the lark feather) and carries visible cost in his broken posture. The internal conflict is embodied, not summarized, and his micro-choices reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's interior contradiction—chaste courtesan versus rebel—is embodied in her "bodily poetic language" and micro-choices under pressure. Her final act is earned by prior causality (mother's lost echo) with visible cost (sweat, trembling). The only minor flaw is a slight abstraction in "weaponized grace," but it doesn't undermine the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is deeply integrated, with embodied contradiction (tracing the stick's grain, feeling its weight) and a micro-choice (placing it down) that reveals a hierarchy of values. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting the cost of revealing mechanics) is earned by the prior argument and reflection, with visible cost in the transformed hush. The urbane calligrapher trait filters perception ("controlled flow of ink") and charges the final image ("luminous ink of understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's esoteric realism is embodied through concrete action and micro-choices, particularly the high-stakes act of knotting. Her motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a credible, earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptionally embodied and specific, with her "technically gentle" hands and lost wax caster expertise filtering every action. Her motivation—preserving forgotten names born from guilt and self-forgiveness—is clear, deep, and compels her high-stakes, precise work. The final choice to cast the light in bronze is earned by her professional skill and emotional journey, with the cost of raw vulnerability ("tears freezing on her cheeks") legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's contradictory condition (foresight hindsight only) is embodied in her perception and forces difficult micro-choices, such as gritting her teeth against visions to count steps.

    Elara's characterization is clear and consistent, with her "scheming pacifism" motivating her subtle, nonviolent strategy. Kael's emotional progression from toxic resentment to tearful release is embodied and credible, though his transformation occurs rapidly under intense pressure.

Her internal conflict is embodied through concrete sensory details ("stained with salt and something less tangible").

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's internal conflict is embodied and specific, with guilt over her past failure ("crushing weight") motivating her search for a spark. Her final choice to light the small flame is a credible, earned endurance act that forecloses on despair. The backstory, while slightly heavy for this length, is anchored in the present by the kerosene rag and successfully tilts her present stance. A minor deduction for the summarized backstory block, which slightly reduces immediacy.

    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (grasping the cicada, focusing on the droplet) revealing her hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallization—returning to meet Kael with "quiet certainty"—is earned by the prior causality of her reflective process.

    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, her "wisely adventurous" trait is demonstrated through cautious action, and her final choice of covenant over conquest is earned.

    Elara's grief is embodied and specific, grounding her motivation. Her emotional progression from mechanical action to crystallized purpose is earned through the tactile discovery of the button and letter.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific, filtered through her scientist’s habits in a tactile way (loupe, dust mapping). The renunciation—choosing patience over spectacle—feels earned by the scene’s particulars. The internal conflict (pressure for drama vs. impulse toward quiet change) is credible, though the epiphany edges tidy. Cost is implied (career/media friction) more than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are clear and rooted in her artist’s temperament transposed into survival tactics; she makes concrete micro‑choices (kneeling to read frost, aligning ledger fragments) under pressure. Interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, bruise mirrored by smudged ink) and character‑specific. Internal contradiction is modest—resolve outweighs doubt—so the arc leans more crystallization than conflict. The closing renunciation of fear into purpose feels earned, though the on‑page cost is more implied than enacted at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s goal is clear and character‑rooted, and her embodied, tactile problem‑solving (miming calm, selecting the quartz resonator) reveals competence under pressure. The internal contradiction—mourning sound while refusing to chase it—registers, though it’s stated more than dramatized. The botanist provides a gentle relational crucible that sharpens her choices without hijacking focus. The change at the end (embracing a new modality) is earned but pays a modest emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motive—an undertaker seeking to give rest a permanent address—drives every action and coheres with his inadvertent stubbornness. Interiority is concrete (calloused fingers, groaning bell) and filtered through his trade; he adapts precision from burial to restoration. The cost lands in his chosen endurance: “his own rest forever deferred.” Minor shortfall: simultaneous contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—sustaining his people and teaching the young—drives tangible choices (bringing teens on the run, risking a chime). Interiority is concrete and embodied (the bell’s weight, the ache easing), with a credible tension between caution and the urge to “declare.” Secondary figures (Marta, Lena, Ravi) add texture without stealing focus. The internal contradiction is subtle rather than searing, but present and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—atoning for a past-life failure of compassion—is clear and specific, and her embodied choices (breathing regimen, handling the tear, manipulating the camera) align with it. The internal conflict between guilt and aspiration is credible and felt through sensory detail. The change is earned: she surrenders the idea of a “vault” and accepts connection as the release mechanism. Slight tidiness at the end softens the felt cost but does not undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motive (to feel the “texture of time”) is clear and drives his choice to seize the fragment. Embodied perception (mint, ozone, vibrating molars) grounds emotion and pressure. Internal contradiction is modest—hubris and grief are present but not strongly at odds in‑scene. The renunciation at the end (leaving the photos) reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—save and plant the seeds—and actions align under pressure (decoding, retrieving, planting, shielding). Embodied perception is vivid (chains, dust, tremors), but internal contradiction is minimal; she almost never wavers. “Patience was her shield” is dramatized, yet her competence rarely missteps. The endurance choice at the end carries cost but not much moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and propulsive, and her actions (feeding the forge, casting, wiring, filtering) align tightly with her aim. Interiority is embodied through sensory cross‑wiring (hearing aurora colors) and tactile labor rather than label‑speak.

Overall, she reads specific, competent, and vulnerably driven.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motive is clear and specific—decode the portrait to reach a charged rendezvous tied to her mother—and her micro-choices (moonbeam reveal, replacing the canvas, descending to Track 13) align with that drive. Interiority is textured and embodied (“press her ear against destiny’s door,” the scent of oil paint, the hum through stone). Internal conflict is present but mostly one-directional; there’s little friction between want and fear on the page. The final renunciation of pure theft for self-revelation feels earned, with an emotional cost implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is specific, embodied, and character‑particular, from theatrical self‑narration to the tactile bond with the cracked bookmark. His motive (crafting “safe zones for inquiry”) coheres with actions and escalates under pressure.

The change feels earned when he leaves the furnace and sanctuary behind.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motives and contradictions are vivid: aquaphobia and injury versus calculated, adaptive action. Her decoding and decision to broadcast evidence are credible micro‑choices under pressure. The relationship with Lena is felt through status and betrayal, even off‑stage. Slight neatness in late epiphanies trims the edge of psychological messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—preserving the prophecy by mapping silence—remains precise and propulsive under pressure. Her interiority is embodied (ink‑salted fingers, ear to cold stone) and consistent. Internal contradiction is subtle (shore‑born attunement versus ridge‑fort vigilance) rather than overtly dramatized, which keeps this shy of elite. Her final stance (silence as ground) feels earned by accumulated micro‑choices.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, singular motive and a history of prior loops ground Unit 7, and the composure vs. past frustration hints at credible change. However, in this scene the pressure on the self is modest—few contradictory impulses surface while playing the violin, so struggle reads low-friction. The closing renunciation of loops is earned but costs mostly conceptually. A more embodied hesitation or risk during the performance would deepen character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s curiosity evolves into an ethically risky choice, moving from observer to participant with credible interior friction (“her own silence… felt suddenly like complicity”). Embodied perception is strong and particular (the lens heavy in her palm; the rain-slicked glass). The action of offering the lens and tickets earns the change without sentimentality. Minor limitation: the cost is social/emotional more than materially risky.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—to prove care outruns metrics—is clear, embodied, and consistent, and her ritualized micro‑choices (polishing, placing the marble) align with that drive. Interiority is specific to her tactile craft and age. The internal conflict is understated (stubborn endurance vs. creeping doubt) rather than dramatized as a sharp contradiction, which keeps it shy of the top band. Still, the closing renunciation of the Quantifiers’ authority reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to vindicate a ridiculed theory) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile, technician‑specific perceptions and micro‑choices (calibrating the lever’s feather‑light pull). Internal conflict exists but remains relatively gentle—fear of alarms and ridicule versus need to act—without a sharp on‑page price extracted. Actions align with motives, and her embodied emotion (“tears freezing on her cheeks”) reads particular. The resolution feels earned but pays a light cost for the risk she takes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive is clear and active, with embodied urgency in micro-choices like guiding a droplet to “a keyhole” stain. Voice and perception feel character‑particular to a musician in a drowned house. Internal contradiction is light—he rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses—so cost reads more situational than psychological. Still, actions align cleanly with motive and culminate in an earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied, with the “fault‑tolerant lattice” of her mind refracting grief through craft. Contradictory impulses (measurement vs. unmeasurable guilt) act simultaneously on the page, culminating in her choice to reinterpret the smudge rather than erase it. Micro‑choices (working at night, placing the illustration on the scale, accepting tremors) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The earned endurance at the end forecloses the fantasy of expiation and reads like a costly, character‑true stance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Leo’s skepticism, curiosity, and tactile engagement with the beaded valve yield credible micro-choices (tuning the radio, lifting/dropping/shouldering the wheel) under rising pressure. Contradictory impulses—mocking ghosts yet feeling their presence—play simultaneously, not in neat stages. The shift from scoffer to “keeper” feels earned if a touch stated. Minor on-the-nose phrasing trims subtlety but not motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s vow to witness without judgment collides credibly with her instinct to save the Eastern Codices, producing a real internal bind. Embodied details (“mind… gripped reality loosely,” “frayed edges”) keep emotions concrete. Her choice to use the deepest fold to witness rather than intervene reads as a principled renunciation with cost. The arc lands as an earned endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives (nurturing wonder through music) are clear and consistent, and her “cautiously exuberant” restraint reads in how she listens first and offers the curl without forcing contact. Interiority is embodied via tactile actions (placing the curl, measured breath, single pure note) rather than label-only feelings. Leo’s shift from terror to awe is credible and rooted in on‑page beats; the father’s role is light but adds pressure. The change lands as earned endurance/renunciation of rushing, with a felt (if quiet) cost in Elara’s careful self‑limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is focused and credible, and her methods (sensing echoes, probing artifacts) align with that drive. Interiority is particular to her sensory capacities, but there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle beyond endurance. The “mission crystallizes” beat earns a measured shift without melodrama. The visible cost is solitude and commitment “until her systems fail,” which lands.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s competence under pressure and embodied actions (adjusting lenses, reading the sea) feel motivated and specific. The yearning “to transpose her life into a new key” is present but functions more as tonal ballast than as a driver of her peak decision. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. desire for change) skim the surface rather than collide on the page. Still, the micro‑choices align cleanly with her keeper identity and yield an earned shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Anselm’s motive is clear—stabilize the anchor by exposing a faulty assumption—and his choices (painting silence, deploying rhetorical loops) reveal character under pressure. The “simple, terrible” realization shows a credible internal stakes shift (belief cannot be forced). Contradictory impulses are present but light (scramble to fix vs. respect for authentic belief). Embodied stress (slumping, trembling stones) supports motivation without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive (to conduct the unheard before exhaustion) is precise and embodied through tactile actions with the shell and memory-mapping. The abandonment of “hollow phrases” grounds her motive. Internal contradiction is modest—desire versus dwindling stamina—so the arc reads linear rather than contested. Still, micro-choices under pressure (what memories to map, when to raise hands) are credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s drive—to “conquer the labyrinth of self”—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (walking through his younger reflection, rejecting the older self, abandoning the tablet). Interiority is concrete and particular to his psyche; contradictory impulses (yearning to save the past vs. choosing a singular forward branch) operate simultaneously. The on‑page cost is legible: he forgoes consolation and the power/tool that has guided him. A faint dock: a few explicitly articulated insights compress ambiguity (“Conquering the labyrinth…”), but they don’t flatten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s longing to break through numbness motivates each micro‑choice, culminating in the risky, character‑specific tactic of reversing the record with a broken needle. Interiority is embodied and particular to a deaf musician interpreting vibration (“felt in her teeth, her ribs”). Internal conflict—yearning for the old pulse vs. resignation to flat practice thumps—registers credibly. The Silas beat adds relational texture but doesn’t apply much counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivations (data‑driven neutrality versus ethical duty) are clear and in tension, and her micro‑choices—examining the dye, encoding the message, leaving the gate unlocked—flow from those traits. The interiority is specific to a meticulous observer and avoids stock phrasing. The change (from strict solitude to selective, covert action) is earned with a felt risk (expulsion). Slight safety in her high competence trims friction, but not fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silas’s motive (to unlock why scent triggers tears) is clear, embodied in tactile action and occupational detail, and culminates in a credible renunciation. His cautiousness versus compulsion to proceed registers as a live tension. Interiority is concrete (lantern work, pollen risks, the cool vial) rather than label-only. A slight tidiness in the closing realization trims some ambiguity but doesn’t undercut the earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—translating “time’s texture” into verse—drives concrete micro‑choices (reweaving knots, testing the rope) under rising pressure. Her contradictory impulses (preserve beauty by surrender vs share it by leaving) are present in-scene and culminate in a third-path choice consistent with her “ethically playful” trait. Emotions are embodied through tactile action (clay scraping, rope fibers, pulse with beings). The cost of leaving the grotto reads, though it’s felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s fear of breaking the “chronic hush” conflicts with her compulsion to “find beauty in the unfinished,” culminating in the choice to unbind the violin. Micro‑choices (placing the bowl, tuning a warped instrument, accepting sour notes) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Embodied perception is character‑specific (hearing the “tick,” “sigh,” and “creak”), and the renunciation of safety for imperfect sound carries a felt cost. No second character is needed; the relationship to the bowl and wrecks functions as the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives (precision, profit, and a guarded care for clients) are embodied through tactile procedure and sensory mapping, not labels. Her contradictory impulses—affectionate detachment vs. a drive toward empathy—are dramatized in the assessment beats and the closing renunciation. The emergent resonance forces a credible internal shift. The final choice (to leave space in the formula) reads earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motives emerge credibly from his shrewdness turned toward remorse and repair; his micro-choices (admitting complicity, proposing the archive, calling the printer) align with an internal reorientation. The tension between transactional reflex and new empathy reads on the page. Elena’s grief is embodied and catalyzes his turn without becoming a prop. The cost is mostly conceptual/social rather than immediate, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s ache to belong is clear and drives concrete choices—joining the search, reading others’ loneliness, declaring a dedication, and laboring three days. Interiority is specific (“ache as luminous as the crater’s glow”) and embodied through action. Internal contradiction is gentler than sharp—more yearning than friction—but still present in the tender ache that both wounds and guides. The final renunciation of outsiderhood feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is crystal and consistent—find the echo’s cradle before the fracture seals—and her choices (the deliberate strike, the borrowing of time) align under pressure. Interiority feels embodied and character‑specific (ink‑stained fingers, illustrator’s eye), with tactile fear and resolve. The internal turn from frustration to decisive risk is credible, though the final explicit articulation of “understanding dawning” edges into told epiphany. Cost registers as exhaustion and a reweighted practice rather than profound loss, keeping the change strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent—she seeks to “understand the mathematics of emotion”—and her choices (using the glass eyes, aligning them with the mosaic) embody that drive. Her interiority is specific and sensorial, linking the orchard’s silence to her brother’s disappearance with embodied ache. Internal conflict is present but muted; she tends toward quick synthesis rather than dramatized friction, which slightly softens the cost. Still, the earned renunciation—accepting the pause rather than forcing a cure—reads credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s kindly, methodical nature is embodied in concrete actions (nightly checks, careful extraction, archival sleeve) and an earned renunciation: she chooses to be seen by ensuring another is heard. The internal contradiction—wanting visibility while living hidden—registers without being overexplained. A slightly stronger sense of risk or cost (fear of discovery, potential repercussion) during the placement could deepen the crucible. Still, reactions to the tape are specific and character-defining.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s controlling precision versus her circuitous sincerity creates credible internal friction that motivates the shift from command to invitation. Concrete micro‑choices—pocketing the anomalous leaf, loosening soil with bare hands, leaving the journal closed—align with her trait set and reveal earned change. The cost (relinquishing control and metrics) is legible and scaled to the scene. A hint of neatness in the resolution keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives—insomnia-fueled need to “thresh meaning”—drive concrete choices (venturing into the storm, digging, seeking Havel, changing what she paints). Interiority is embodied and specific (salt-crusted windows, trembling hands), and the enemy insignia forces credible ambivalence rather than tidy forgiveness. The final renunciation of painting only war wounds feels earned by her encounters with the brooch and Havel. Minor note: “wryly earnest” is mostly shown through action but still leans on a label once.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (guiding the villagers, seeking the pearl) and flaw (grand-event focus) are clear and tested when her prediction fails. Her embodied responses—recoiling, then reaching for shadow—register a credible shift. The acceptance of the pearl and the choice to “inhabit” mark an earned reorientation with implied cost of renouncing her prior certainties. The pilgrim adds pressure without stealing agency, keeping the crucible intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—turning fragments into meaning and then into communal heartening—is clear and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (picking the valve, deciding on staggered calls). Interiority is embodied (“tremor in her chest,” the cold of rain) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is modest; she moves from archivist to clandestine herald without much resistance shown. The felt cost is present but quiet (secrecy, burden, grief), scaled to the piece’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motive (mapping toward the rumored fortress) is clear and personal, evolving into a need to confront his guilt. His meticulous mindset and grief inform concrete micro-choices (following arrows, punching cracks, hesitating at the booth). The threshold hesitation credibly dramatizes contradictory impulses before the palm‑punch confession. The change is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied (salt spray, white knuckles), her skepticism credibly challenged by an on‑page vision, and her choice to risk ridicule for the whales reads motivated. The internal contradiction—skeptic guarding relics vs. latent belief—operates in scene and resolves into a believable stance shift. Slight softness: villagers’ quick acceptance reduces the social price we feel she pays for speaking up.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, pressing motivation (to discover what happens after goodbye) drives concrete choices under pressure. Interiority is specific—boredom “settled into his bones,” mistrust of the shard after it consumed a city—yielding a credible renunciation. Contradictory impulses (hunger for answer vs. fear of the shard’s cost vs. survival) register in action. A touch more embodied struggle at the peak would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—an honest calculus to save a dishonest father—is specific, credible, and drives each micro‑choice (equations, proposal, refusal to lie). The internal tension (inheritance of brilliance vs. moral rot) is present on the page without therapy‑speak. Some beats feel a touch too tidy—her certainty under stress rarely frays—limiting felt struggle. Still, action and interior align and culminate in a stance with visible cost (only a partial concession secured).

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystal: to collect the textures of time before silence erases them, and her tactics (gridding, charcoal choices, calibration) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied and specific (“vibrated in her molars,” tears from “aching connection”), with competence meeting desperation. The internal contradiction—incandescent restraint under panic—is present but soft; true conflict doesn’t bite hard beyond craft vs. loss. The final poise (preparing for the next resonance) reads as earned endurance with a felt cost of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s drive—to rebuild memory’s texture and counter official erasure—is vivid and embodied (mud, salt, metal), and actions align: eavesdropping, assembling fragments, etching, then sacrificing the label. Internal contradiction is subtler (survival vs. pursuit of truth) and could tighten under a sharper moment of jeopardy. The final renunciation (pressing the label into mud) reads as an earned stance with cost. Voice-specific perception (“layers of absence”) gives individuality without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s grief-driven skepticism gives him a credible motive and a palpable contradiction: myth buster seeking a mystical answer. Micro-choices (taking out the shell, deciding to bow the one‑string cello, leaning into the hum) reveal character under pressure. The acceptance at the end forecloses his prior posture, though the cost of relinquishing proof could be sharpened. Interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s dual allegiance is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—reading the graffiti, convening the meeting, and choosing to reorganize rather than confront. Interiority is specific and embodied (“hope warred with desperation,” the calliope’s tune under his chest) and aligns with his role as culture shock absorber. The handoff of the chip to Elara externalizes his internal shift credibly. A slight neatness in the pivot to leadership keeps it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motive—secure the last unblemished image before obliteration—is clear and drives concrete choices (the chemical timer, the moonlit vantage, the refusal to look back). His interiority is specific and embodied (the sand grain’s weight, the click’s relief), with a credible contradiction: he understands progress yet mourns its cost. Micro‑choices under pressure (trusting molecules over his hands, waiting through the hush) reveal value hierarchy. The change is an earned endurance/renunciation: he takes the frame and accepts loss without consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific (repair the drone in time for her daughter’s departure), and her competence is embodied through tactile, technical choices. The interiority is sensorially distinct without therapy‑speak. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little emotional friction beyond concentration. The final renunciation/cost reads as quiet endurance rather than a charged trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and mindset are clear and particular—an exacting, dry wit that trusts data under pressure. We feel a credible tension between worry and quiet certainty, with embodied stakes (cold, time) and concrete micro‑choices (aligning dog‑ear to frost, deciding to trust the pattern). The internal conflict is modest and resolves without much friction, keeping the arc from deepening into a harder cost. Still, actions and reactions stay consistent and character‑specific.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—restore shared balance—is focused and embodied through tactile choices (barefoot cadence, touching Tomas’s arm). Interiority is present and specific, though she faces little inner contradiction; her steadiness carries more than it complicates. Secondary pressure exists (Tomas’s scoff, Finn’s impatience) but remains gentle. The earned endurance at the end reads credible, if low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motive (survival via a clean signal) collides with panic, yielding a concrete, earned renunciation: he suppresses the instinct to bolt and commits to focus. Interiority is embodied (rebreather hiss, cold limbs) and character‑specific via the hush’s memory‑touch guiding his tactics. The visible cost includes time, oxygen, and relinquishing the vial. A hair of lyric generalization creeps in, but the choice remains credibly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation—escape before inheriting his father’s disbelief—drives the piece, embodied by tactile cues (cold bars, salt spray). The internal tension between inherited lie and private truth is present, though slightly stated rather than dramatized in contradiction. Micro‑choices (not turning the knob, carrying the lattice, choosing hush over plea) reveal values under pressure. A felt change occurs as he renounces being defined by his father, though the emotional cost could be shaded with one sharper conflicting impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s caretaking and the ghost bride’s debt‑driven purpose are clear, with embodied reactions (fogged breath, raw voice) grounding feeling. The ghost’s paradox—healing that harms—gives her motivation specificity. However, Silas remains largely reactive; few micro‑choices under pressure limit layered contradiction. The relationship dynamic is poignant but offers limited on‑page negotiation beyond his plea to stop.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (“carve a path from ruin to reverence”) is clear, embodied in specific labor and anchored to a talismanic object. Her agency is consistent and purposeful, and her bleeding fingers provide tangible cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves with steady conviction more than contested impulse. The fisherman’s line adds a relational echo but not substantial character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is specific and consistent—restore a fractured faith—and her tactics (patient wandering, deep listening) align with that. Interiority is embodied through tactile observation rather than label-speak. However, conflicting impulses are muted; she rarely faces a live inner contradiction that forces a painful trade-off on the page. The final act reads earned but relatively unopposed emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—protecting anonymity to uncover “meaning in the margins”—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices (kneeling to read chalk, verifying at the kiosk). Interiority is specific and character‑particular, avoiding therapy‑speak. Internal conflict is present but gentle (reverence for analog ritual vs the surveillance world), limiting sharpness under pressure. The final act (mailing the letter after a re‑read of the pseudonym’s truth) feels earned though not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (decode anomalies, warn rebels) are clear and intensify under pressure. Her split between “scatterbrained” performance and razor‑focused craft reads embodied (thimble drop, mirrored glass). Fear and composure coexist convincingly as the guard passes. Minor safety: her competence borders on smooth, with little on‑page cost beyond risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, and her embodied urgency (bleeding palm, fatigue, “payment” to the labyrinth) grounds the lyricism. Contradictory impulses—seeking understanding not reversal—show in her “fierce tenderness” and refusal to change the past. Micro‑choices (“Show me the hesitation,” then “Show me the moment she almost turned!”) reveal priorities under cost. Slight tidiness in the concluding self‑diagnosis trims peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied, with a clear throughline from translator-guilt to the micro-choices of decoding, revising the cast’s symbol, and relinquishing the coral. The contradiction—shrewdness paired with tenderness under anesthetic haze—animates his perception and tactics. The ethical risk of promising “return” adds complexity and cost. Mei’s presence functions as crucible without becoming a cipher herself.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to recover lost joy) is clear and drives concrete choices: salvaging the projector, loading flawed film, casting the image, committing to return. Interiority is vivid and embodied (tears, grime, tactile handling of the fragment), though contradictory impulses are light—fear or doubt seldom push back in‑scene. The remembered network and grandmother calibrate her values without safety‑hedging. The final renunciation of passivity (she will display daily) reads earned with a gentle, credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s internal pivot from habitual certainty to chosen curiosity is legible and grounded in action (the nickel flick). Embodied details (coin’s temperature/weight, brush work) keep her interior alive. The cost of relinquishing certainty reads more conceptual than felt, which softens the turn’s bite. The visitor adds light pressure but doesn’t deepen her contradiction beyond a single nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motive—guarding the inner spark—consistently drives concrete choices (decoding the seed, planting under a live sweep). The interiority is specific and embodied (the cracked spectacles, soil, drone light) but shows little contradictory impulse or wobble under stress. He reads highly competent with minimal visible struggle, softening the felt cost. The relationship with Elara adds pressure and context but doesn’t force a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and consistent—“to photosynthesize pain into beauty”—and his endurance under insomnia reads as a lived flaw rather than a badge. Interiority is embodied through tactile behaviors (tracing constellations, folding into kelp mats, humming). The contradictory impulses—ache versus the need to transmute it—coexist rather than alternate. The final acceptance of sleep feels earned by the centuries of persistence and the poem-as-blossom turn.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (tuning fork vs. song; pressing ear to opal; risking a shattering) track under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“foxglove regret,” exhaustion), though internal contradiction is minimal beyond perseverance versus despair. The final endurance choice reads earned, with visible cost in fatigue and the ongoing burden. A touch more ambivalence or a misstep under stress could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—atonement and restoring trust—is concrete and drives each micro‑choice (which text first, what promise to weave). The carefully reckless/cautious duality is embodied through the fragile ink well and measured pace under a ticking clock. Internal conflict is present but muted; after the first breakthrough, resistance becomes minimal and competence dominates. Still, her humility-by-necessity feels earned by the prior failure and the looming council vote.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s professional acuity, moral tension, and embodied stress (“hand trembling…from fatigue” shifting to awe) create a credible, particular interiority. Micro‑choices (vinegar, chain, decision to trust Elara over protocol) align tightly with motive and stakes. The contradiction—public safety vs. preservation—acts in scene rather than as summary. Cost is mostly conceptual (defying council/protocol), but it’s legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a former forger seeking redemption through preservation, torn between control and necessary risk. Embodied details (trembling hands, dust‑mote practice) ground her psychology. The final choice to entrust Hermes credibly emerges from the established fear/need dynamic. Minor neatness in the relief afterward skirts tidy resolution but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s goal is clear and steadily intensifies: stabilize reality and understand sacred thresholds tied to her father’s disappearance. The final renunciation—bowing instead of rushing—credibly forecloses a path with felt cost. Interiority stays particular (bench grain as “maze corridors”), revealing methodical tenderness under stress. A touch of tidy articulation (“Thresholds feel sacred…”) edges toward thesis but is grounded in character memory.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—seeking a rhythm of belonging—drives concrete choices (recalibrating lights to mimic kelp pulses), and her displacement between surface and deep reads as lived contradiction. Emotions are embodied (salt‑crusted console, hum against pressure) and object‑focused (burnt feather) rather than labeled. The small but charged contact with Kael adds relational pressure without crowding the POV. The final renunciation of frantic seeking for felt belonging is earned and carries cost (risked power, acceptance of the deep’s terms).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clean and specific, and the “cheerful gloom” registers as a consistent, character‑particular texture. Interiority is present through embodied use of the crater glass, but genuine contradiction under pressure is light. Competence stays high with little visible struggle or cost in the decisive beats. The final choice (gathering and teaching) feels earned but relatively low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and method are clear and character‑specific (an analytical performer orchestrating the tide), and her micro‑choices enact that identity. Interiority is present but largely single‑valent—she’s composed and calculating with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The audience’s presence exerts only light social pressure, limiting relational crucible. The ending implies endurance/renunciation (letting the sea “play” before she does), but the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—defying a nostalgia ban to inscribe a prophetic verse on her skin—is clear and consistent, with tactile interiority (calloused fingers, cool soil) grounding her. The key micro-choices (smuggling the speck, mixing tears, continuing through pain/anchoring) align with her role as tide dancer. Internal contradiction is mild—yearning vs. risk—but largely harmonized rather than fought on the page. The renunciation cost (spirit departing, body left) lands credibly from established desire.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority rooted in craft; Elias’s restlessness with “spectacle over substance” motivates his predawn ritual and frames the micro‑choices (waiting with the stone, reading the rings). The internal contradiction—artisan pride vs. hollow commissions—operates in scene. His final stance to return to work “ready to find the extraordinary glow” is earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized. Embodied details (cold seeping, palm imprint) keep emotions grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kai’s interiority is concrete and embodied (scars, the porcelain box), and his guilt-to-resolve shift reads earned by accumulated memory and tactile handling. The contradictory impulses—penance vs. outreach—are present, though the realization lands a touch tidy. The father–daughter breach motivates him credibly across the piece. A few lines compress complex psychology into thesis-like declarations, slightly smoothing struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (recalibrating the gauge, iterating patterns) reveal character under pressure. The tension between “logical” and “dreamer,” and between eroded spirit and persistence, gives credible interior texture. However, the internal conflict resolves too smoothly once the new pattern works, with limited felt cost in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s obsession and perceptual gift drive concrete choices (opening the diary, handling the negative, deciding to carry the record forward). Interiority is textured—his re-valuation of what walls “dream” reads earned rather than declared. Contradictory impulses (curiosity versus the sorrow he uncovers) are present but lightly rendered rather than dramatized under sharp pressure. Still, the final resolve feels credibly motivated by the scene’s discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, concrete motivation (coax mirrors into possibilities) with embodied tactics (calm, modulation) and a credible constraint (“panic fractured light”). Limited inner contradiction or cost to the painter herself keeps the arc steady rather than transformative. Secondary emotional pressure comes through participants (widower’s warmth), not her interior conflict. Competent endurance rather than a change-based arc lands, appropriate but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive and guilt are embodied through tactile ritual (the ebony clipboard, breath, accords) and a concrete, high-cost decision. Contradictory impulses—duty, shame, political suicide—operate simultaneously in the confrontation. Her admission and promised censure align with her flaw history (earlier rigid protocol) and show credible endurance with cost. Kael’s wary engagement sharpens status dynamics without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thorne’s contradiction—amoral profiteer with a tender fixation on the lark—drives credible, embodied choices, culminating in the sacramental placement of the egg. Interiority is textured and specific (the boyhood feather, the tactile attention to cracks and salt). Lena’s presence adds just enough social pressure to expose status dynamics without hijacking POV. The final renunciation (leaving the egg) reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—freeing the echoes and risking her station—reads clear and consistent, with the mother’s voice sharpening urgency. Embodied micro‑choices (the fingertip work on threads, the focus on the central knot) reveal character under pressure. Internal contradiction is muted (she’s largely unwavering), though the “chaste defiance” frame gives her stance nuance. The final endurance and renunciation of safety feel earned but lightly costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interiority is specific, embodied, and morally fraught; the calligrapher/puppeteer duality gives credible contradiction between control and subversion. The off‑page relationship with Mara applies tangible pressure that shapes the present stance. The final renunciation/commitment (“reveal the strings”) feels earned by prior beats and costs social harmony and aesthetic certainty. A slight tidiness in the clarity of the final insight keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—honoring overlooked histories—drives each tactile choice, from cairn‑building to the precise knot. Her embodied interiority (calloused fingers, breath, tears) is specific and credible. The contradiction between control (perfect knots, deliberate placement) and surrender (accepting the wing’s loss) culminates in an earned renunciation. Agency dips at the climax (the monarch intervenes), but the acceptance reads motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve erased voices—drives every micro‑choice and is filtered through her craft competence. The guilt-to-forgiveness arc is credible and rooted in tactile action (aligning holes, rebraiding, pouring bronze). Internal contradiction is quieter (fear vs. hard‑won calm) and could show more friction under pressure. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting emotional exposure as cost) reads earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (protect the bunker and decode why paths choose walkers) is clear and intensifies under the storm’s clock. Her “foresight/hindsight only” limitation creates credible internal tension that she must actively counter to act in the present. Micro‑choices—pocketing the seal, counting to the seventh oak, pressing the seal—track to her values. The final renunciation of “guarding” for “witnessing” feels earned, though a touch of tidy epiphany softens the messiness of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motive—sealing a covenant before erasure—drives specific, tactile choices (aligning the tile, whispering the oath, extinguishing the candle). The internal contradiction between empiricism and ritual is dramatized (his almost-scoff before the glow) rather than merely labeled. Emotion is embodied (calloused hands, tears, chipped bowl) and consistent with his frugality. The cost is primarily conceptual; a sharper on‑page price would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and tactics are crystal clear and embodied—“scheming pacifist” reads in her patience, timing, and object choice. Kael’s resentment is not just labeled; it’s tested and softened through the music box’s beats and his physical reaction. The turn toward release is swift but earned by the cumulative notes and sensory recall. A slight tidiness in the resolution trims ambiguity around lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—recreating the sextant to “capture a runaway dream”—is clear, and her shift from skepticism to surrender via Silas’s guidance is credible and embodied. The relationship dynamic works as a crucible: Silas applies gentle but real pressure that changes her tactic. Internal contradiction (practical hands chasing the impossible) is present but lightly dramatized, with limited on‑page cost beyond letting go of fixing the tool. Still, actions align with motives, and the final renunciation reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and flaws are concrete: stubborn craft devotion and a misbelief about permanence drive her choices. Her micro-choices (scolding the vine, searching the satchel, deciding to sacrifice the ribbon) reveal a hierarchy of values with embodied cost. The internal turn—reframing vows as seasonal—feels earned by the act of mending with the ribbon. Liora’s brief on‑page return provides a relational crucible without diluting Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aris’s interiority is specific and embodied—“brightened disquiet,” the lavatory refuge, the tactile weight of the shell—grounding his bewilderment in concrete choices. The directive “Observe. Do not interact.” sets a credible internal conflict that he breaks, revealing character under pressure. The leap to epiphany is earned by prior sensory anchors, though the moral cost of violating the Archive could be more explicitly felt. His final act—replacing the cameo—credibly forecloses a path and accepts consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive and competence read clearly, and her paid cost (surrendering a lesson) grounds motivation with consequence. However, interior contradiction is light; we seldom feel competing impulses under pressure beyond a prudent balancing act. Kael functions as a foil/ticking clock rather than a relationship crucible. The final choice aligns with her established traits and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s drive to recover Elara’s name is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the card and ship shows embodied motivation under pressure. The “blissfully aberrant” trait productively enables her to enter echoes, though internal contradiction (comfort vs. compulsion) remains more stated than dramatized. The final acceptance—kindling solace in herself—reads earned by the preceding tactile discoveries. A sharper glimpse of cost (fear of losing Elara by accepting the search) would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent, and her calmly precise method under pressure reveals character. Interiority is particular (ink-stained fingers, syncing with the tick), though internal contradiction is modest—flutter vs. method isn’t a true clash of values. Choices (unbraid, rebraid, bind seal) align with motive and drive the turn. The cost is largely conceptual and quiet rather than personally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—restore quiet—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (reading crack patterns, aligning the stone, choosing inversion over force) reveal competence under strain. The cost lands as earned exhaustion and the relinquishing of the map. Internal contradiction is subtle (depletion vs. will), not deeply dramatized, keeping this shy of the top band. Still, her embodied focus and tactile engagement with tools and ice feel specific and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—rekindle the beacon to prove pattern in “coincidence”—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (placing/angling the shard). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with fear and conviction coexisting in her trembling and breathless focus. Internal contradiction is present but mild; doubt never seriously contends with her certainty. The final choice feels earned, with emotional cost shown in tears and physical strain rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—verifying and preserving collective memory—drives concrete choices (measuring shadows, transcribing). Interiority is textured (preemptive nostalgia vs duty) and embodied through touch with the crystal and the ache at dawn. The internal contradiction is present but subtle, resolved via an earned endurance rather than a dramatic pivot. A slightly greater sense of risk or sacrifice in the act of transcription could have deepened the on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s guilt as a fireworks designer who caused a tragedy crisply motivates her hyper‑vigilant “Step. Breathe. See.” attention and the final, risky act of lighting a flame. The contradictory impulses—fear of fire versus need to kindle hope—surface in tactile beats (handling the rag, choosing the basin). Micro‑choices track cleanly and reveal values. The closing shift to “Create” reads earned rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and interior contradictions are clear: tradition-bound patience versus the pressure to answer Kael’s modern demands. Her embodied attention to the droplet and cicada reveals character under pressure. The choice to return “not with defense” is earned, though the on‑page cost remains subtle. Relationship pressure is mostly offstage, slightly softening the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive—collecting silences to survive claustrophobia—is clear, embodied, and drives every tactic. Contradictory impulses surface under pressure: control via “seven heartbeats” versus surrendering the doll to nurture the hush. The decisive relinquishment of method and prized object reads as an earned shift with felt cost. Relationship stakes with the father remain off‑stage but charge her purpose credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motive—transforming brittle silence into a comforting hush—is clear and consistent, and his tactics (calibrated humming, decibel management) align with it. Interiority is specific to his acoustic mindset, but his competence smooths away friction, and contradictory impulses are muted. The decision to forsake fare is a light cost rather than a crucible. He reads distinct, though the repetition of “fluidly logical” flirts with label over embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and character‑specific—“wisely adventurous” shows in coaxing paint rather than scraping and in using the ruby flake with care. Interiority is present in embodied terms (moss, ozone, throat tightening) without therapy‑speak. The renunciation at the throne reads earned by prior values. Minor gap: her temptation to rule never surfaces, so the internal conflict stays gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is clean and compelling—guard the threshold and relieve despair—and her choice to “link through scars” is earned by the sister backstory and present pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied (ash, bones, breath), avoiding therapy-speak. The contradiction—protecting the living by deepening her solitude—registers as a credible cost. Minor softness: her struggle feels almost too assured, with little risk of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation as a pyramid-scheme survivor is clear, embodied by her tactile engagement with the bolt and press, and her decisive action tracks. Interiority is concrete (“pressure building like tectonic plates”), but internal conflict is limited—she moves from recognition to execution with little friction. Silas, present on the page, functions mainly as a foil with minimal complexity. The final choice feels earned yet relatively unambivalent emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and sustained—she’s the “dynasty ender” seeking Silas’s truth—and her micro‑choices (attuning the crank, reading the waves, returning the object) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile focus and atmospheric perception rather than labels. Internal contradiction is mild; she moves toward understanding without much resistance, limiting depth of conflict. Still, the final renunciation/reframing feels earned by prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Torin’s shame-hardened retreat and reluctant, ritual-driven action read as a coherent arc from avoidance to charged acceptance. Interiority is embodied (dusty armor, trembling finger) rather than labeled, and his vow’s reinterpretation motivates the decisive act. The tension between past failure and present risk gives credible friction, though the cost remains more conceptual than concrete. A second on‑page presence might have sharpened contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief, curiosity, and professional instinct align into a credible pivot from numb processing to purposeful curation. Embodied details—the chip on the button, the fluorescent hum—ground her interiority. The turn risks neatness (“Proof that love persists…”) but feels earned by the tactile sequence of choices. Emotional contradiction (pain and awakening purpose) is present without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive (sister erased; refusal of indifference) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices under pressure (puddle-map reading, pipe crawl, dropping the key) align with it. Interiority is concise and embodied (shivering in auric water) rather than diagnostic. The piece lacks a pronounced internal contradiction—he’s steadfast more than conflicted—which trims depth. Still, the endurance at the end reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clean and rooted in duty; the “last keeper” burden and the grandfather memory give him credible stakes. Interiority is concrete (breath, brass, stone vibrations), but internal contradiction is light—he rarely wavers or errs. Micro‑choices (waiting to play, calibrating silences) reveal competence under pressure. The endurance ending reads as earned stasis, though the felt personal cost could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—decoding the leaves to save the arbor—is clear, embodied in tactile work and precise micro‑choices (withdrawing the speck, the exact prod, sacrificing the last spore). Interiority is filtered through her vocation with specificity (“mossy delight”), avoiding stock feeling labels. The internal contradiction is mild (orderly ritualist choosing to risk and expend rare seeds), so pressure on her psychology remains gentle. Still, the sacrifice of the last sky‑orchid spore gives her final choice credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motive—to test surrender against his compulsion for control—is clear and consistently embodied through tools, mapping fractures, and the improvisation at the chasm. Contradictory impulses (“uncertainly certain”) surface under pressure and shape his tactic shift. The renunciation—leaving the compass—lands as a credible change with a modest but felt cost. The epiphany edges neat (“let it flow”), but it’s earned by the concrete ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motive (redemption) is clear and consistently pressured, and his flaw (control-fixation) is confronted through concrete micro‑choices (scraping away failed mercury, re‑attempting with altered intention). Interiority is embodied via tactile alchemical work and specific memories of Elara. The renunciation—returning without the body—lands with visible cost. A touch of thematic over‑articulation (“He hadn’t failed her…”) slightly tidies what’s otherwise earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s goal and methods are clear, embodied in tactile choices with the tooth and misaligned harp. Interiority is mostly shown through sensory focus and tactic, not labels, and her calm resolve reads consistent. However, she faces little internal contradiction or visible struggle; competence smooths pressure. The “understood instantly” beat edges toward telling and trims ambiguity at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s embodied interiority is vivid and specific, with micro‑choices under pressure (subtle stance shifts, testing the air) revealing a mind bent on extracting mercy from pain. The trauma reflexes complicate his agency without erasing it, showing contradictory impulses of recoil and analytic control. Motivation (“the mathematics of mercy”) coheres and deepens rather than arriving as a late label. The closing endurance is earned and forecloses ease: pain remains even as he finds modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—honoring drowned keepers via the ledger—and every choice aligns with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile handling of the lens and the grandmother’s aphorism, but contradictory impulses are limited; she almost never doubts or risks failure. Micro-choices (how to angle the lens, which canvas to approach next) reveal competence more than conflict. The ending shows commitment rather than change; the cost is primarily emotional and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s motive (compulsive need to uncover what ceilings hide) is clear and action-driving, and his profession/ghost‑sight inform credible tactics. Interiority is specific (dust reading, tool‑logic), though internal contradiction is mild—it’s sorrow more than a live conflict. His engagement with Thorn shows character under pressure without melodrama. The resolution (freeing the ghost) costs him a cherished “secret‑keeper” stance, but the price reads primarily as quiet sorrow, not a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is explicit and sustained—compress eternity before rupture—and actions align (uncorking the whisper, using the mirror-page). Interiority is present via tactile, profession-shaped perceptions (typebars, frost language) but contradictions are light; he’s decisive more than conflicted. The fear of the press “tearing reality apart” adds human pressure but resolves quickly. The closing renunciation/endurance—accepting a remade library while sacrificing perfection—lands but with limited felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation (atonement through proof) is clear and intensifies under the storm, and her interior conflict—fervor vs. regret—is embodied in tactile choices (placing the shard, reciting the verse). Her ex‑revolutionary guilt sharpens the final cost without hedging. Varek functions as a focused counter‑pressure that reveals her stance. The closing acceptance of loss reads as an earned endurance/renunciation rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motive is crystalline and embodied through the covenant’s cost; the metallic taste and rust‑scarred hands ground his interiority in action. His competence meets genuine risk—self‑deception would shatter the chip—giving him a credible internal edge. The hinted thief adds pressure but never enters the crucible, limiting relational complexity. Still, the final endurance feels earned and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—seeking “the place where explanations fail”—is clear and tightened by her scientist’s pride versus the pull to surrender. The internal contradiction (calibrated instruments vs. “Science ended here”) manifests in concrete choices. Embodied detail (molars vibrating, clay on cheeks) keeps emotion specific. The final renunciation—leaving the kit—earns the change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s artistic sensibility and patience are vivid, and her choices (using the slide, reframing the storm, retrieving the spiral) align with her “perpetually learning” drive. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets the crisis with an already compatible worldview, so the epiphany feels deepening rather than hard-won. Embodied emotion is strong (wind, cold, hum in the ribs). The final renunciation/commitment costs comfort but doesn’t reveal a shadow value resisted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—reckon with Leo’s mystery—and her actions (waiting in the cold cathedral, angling cards, then choosing a new mural approach) track cleanly. The interiority is embodied (pigment‑stained fingers, cold stone in her bones) and avoids therapy‑speak. The shift from “shouting” murals to “umbral tenderness” feels earned by on‑page discovery, though the realization lands a touch neatly. Contradictory impulses—public vividness vs. private hush—coexist and resolve credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—to decode Cora’s diary and honor silenced voices—is clear and intensifies under the retrocognitive assaults. Interiority is embodied (smell of burning tires, baton crack) and specific to an archivist living in artifacts. Micro-choices (arranging debris, reinterpreting symbols, taking the ladder) reveal values under pressure. Slightly tidy emotional release at the end keeps it just short of outstanding complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular motivation—reject illusion, build on reality—drives all actions, and the bottle interactions reveal character under pressure. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“working memory strained”), though contradictory impulses barely surface; he never truly wavers toward false comfort. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned, with a felt solitude cost. A hair more on-the-page temptation would deepen conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives (from oath scribe to archivist of emotions) are clear and evolve under pressure, culminating in the renunciation that his work preserves a death rattle. Interiority is specific and embodied (“velvet disquiet,” wax burning his skin), with micro‑choices (immersing in memory, adjusting the stylus, speaking the last line) revealing values. The internal contradiction—preserver versus tomb‑keeper—surfaces credibly through the prophecy. Limited external interaction keeps the arc intimate but never thin.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear: she must save the Vault while seeking to “discover the texture of borrowed time,” and the “furiously tranquil” state credibly holds both fear and steadiness at once. Embodied detail (ice stinging skin, syncing breath to the creak of ice) grounds her interiority. The piece could sharpen cost by showing a wobble or near‑failure to stress her limits under pressure. Still, actions align with intent and reveal character through choice rather than label.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation and interior conflict are clean: protocol versus a practiced ethic of “listening over noise.” Embodied micro‑choices (switch hovered, tracker sensitivity increased, fingers on the rope) reveal character under pressure. The renunciation is earned by prior habits and costs her obedience and reputation. Slight idealization—few visible personal flaws beyond caution—keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s grief, ritualized labor, and “cosmic janitor” ethos motivate concrete micro-choices, culminating in staying to shield the chronometers. The flight/stay contradiction is dramatized under storm pressure, not summarized. Embodied detail (star‑ash grit, knotted hands, the shard’s cool) grounds interiority. A faint tendency toward aphoristic neatness in the closing realizations slightly softens the messiness of human contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motive—guarding the unspoken—reads clear and consistent, and his renunciation at the end (choosing to listen, not speak) feels earned. Interiority is specific to his perceptual habits (reading chips and splinters as history). However, internal contradiction is light; curiosity vs duty never truly bites, keeping tension modest. The ghost child’s cue catalyzes him, but his emotional struggle remains mostly serene rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—feeling and safeguarding time’s “texture”—is clear and drives concrete choices (the coded ad, the purchase, the silo act). Interiority is particular (time as grit, ash as encoded sorrow) and embodied. Internal contradiction (duty vs. risk, patience vs. urgency) is present but lightly sketched, with little friction on the page. The ending’s stance—accepting the burden of covert stewardship—reads earned, if not deeply torqued by competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—seeking beauty in the incomplete—is distinct and drives her micro-choices (approaching the water to “tend” discord rather than fix the kite). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, revealing a perfectionist tension that she reweights by the end. The cost is modest but present: she relinquishes the fantasy of a “perfect” poem and returns the feather. Stakes stay intimate, yet the shift reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motive—make the symbiosis undeniable before death—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (measure strain, place wires, endure rain). His “brazen calm” under a terminal clock creates a credible tension between urgency and composure, though internal contradiction is modest. Embodied emotion (raw hands, tight lungs) grounds him without therapy‑speak. The final renunciation of self (“Not me, but the pact”) reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and embodied—she smuggles the amber, samples soil, and runs the test. Interiority is specific to her scientific skepticism, with tactile choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is light and the on‑page cost remains mostly implied (career risk, solitude), which softens the crucible. The final renunciation/acceptance is conceptual more than emotionally torn.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, rooted motivation (reclaiming a battlefield through a garden) with embodied grief and endurance; choices (seed scattering, replying in dead tongues) align with his values. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—sorrow versus hope—without a sharp in‑scene clash. Micro‑choices under pressure (trusting birds’ signals, crushing pods) reveal a principled, ritual mindset. A felt cost exists (war memory, patience), though a sharper internal rub would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motive—translating distance into closeness—threads cleanly through each beat and culminates in a credible renunciation of “digging for the dead.” Interiority is embodied via scent-logics and tactile recalls (leaf, tobacco, lavender), and the micro-choices (try the phonograph, re-examine grooves, deploy the leaf) illuminate character. A slight anthropomorphic slippage (“palm,” “pocket”) momentarily distracts, but his perceptual signature holds. The final decision to go east carries emotional cost and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (honoring a family ritual to transmute confusion into exploration) is specific and enacted through sketching and alignment to the compass. The pariah/blessing tension gives credible contradiction and colors her embodied perceptions. The pivotal realization (“clarity flooded her—the crisis hadn’t been her fault”) leans a touch declarative, skirting convenience. Still, the closing commitment to return with new paper reads as an earned stance rather than a neat cure-all.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motives (to amend imbalance) are clear and consistent, and his ethic shapes concrete choices (offerings to wyrms, the acorn token). Interiority is specific (“cautious abandon,” joy braided with duty) and embodied in tactile action on ice. Internal tension exists but is modest; he moves through fear rather than wrestles with it. The closing self-repricing (“amended his own fear”) is earned by on‑page risk, though the cost remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (“historian of small gestures”) is clear, embodied, and tested when the survivor appears, forcing her to confront the actor/survivor split. Micro‑choices (waiting for the penumbra, spelling words, opening the false bottom, cutting twine) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses—ruthless observation vs. tenderness and self‑protection vs. exposure—operate simultaneously. The costed change (unbinding the journal and placing the pawn) feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied: grief-driven avoidance of reading collides with the urgent need to recover “the shape of home.” Contradictory impulses (fleeing pain vs. choosing to read/activate the stone) operate simultaneously at the peak beat. Micro‑choices (feather pressed, scraping the sliver, holding through the dawn fray) reveal values with felt cost. The closing stance shift—carrying home within—feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motive is clear and enacted through tactile micro-choices—fidgeting turns into purposeful thread‑work. Internal contradiction (shame versus analytic rigor) plays on the page and culminates in a credible renunciation of self‑punishment. The exoneration arrives a touch neatly, but it’s anchored in her specific skillset. The final apology to her younger self reads earned rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motive—to refract a singular decree into multiplicity—is clear and drives each micro‑choice, especially the decision to raise the quartz rather than recant. Interiority is specific and embodied (calloused hand, warmth of quartz), with Vanya’s subtle softening adding a credible relational crucible. The internal contradiction is modest (Kael’s fear vs. defiance is implied more than dramatized), but the final refusal to retract reads earned. Secondary pressure via Vanya and guardians is focused and relevant.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive—mend to make meaning at the edge of dissolution—is clear, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her uncertainty and doubt play against her resolve in the tactile beats (the hand in acid, the tremor while tracing gold). Micro-choices (matching pockmarks, continuing after the beam shears) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The final acceptance of death reads as an earned renunciation rather than melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular—fulfilling a self-imposed vow and releasing Clara—dramatized through concrete choices (abandoning the canvas, entering the cave, placing the shell, not looking back). Interiority is embodied and specific (oilskin apron tug, phosphorescent moss) with credible contradictory impulses (nostalgia vs. presence). The renunciation at the end forecloses a path with felt cost. A few explicit realizations (“It wasn’t magic…”) slightly tidy the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s motive—save the Marigold and vindicate Mara’s lesson—is clear and intensifies under pressure. His restraint (weeping instead of cheering, refusing to shout) reveals contradictory impulses handled in scene. Embodied detail (sea-slicked stone, aching throat, trembling fingers) grounds emotion. Minor idealization of his belief system trims some ambiguity but not momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motives (save ships, reach Elara through work) are precise and pressure-tested, with embodied detail (solder burns, patchwork limbs) rooting emotion. The hesitation before igniting the censer with tears shows a credible micro‑conflict that turns into choice. Flaws persist—grief remains rather than tidily resolving—making the final endurance feel earned. A touch more contradiction under peak pressure could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to quiet the psychic static via truffle lore) is clear and presses her into a risky, character‑specific choice. Contradictory impulses—rational skepticism vs. desperate hope—operate simultaneously, especially at the “grace in fracture” echo. The cost (heightened truth compulsion) exposes a flaw that complicates her ethics in the Hemlock moment. Secondary pressure is lean but effective: Hemlock’s arrival turns inner stakes outward without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interiority is specific and embodied—oilskin, knotted fingers, tea‑leaf charts—so his motive to decode the gesture reads earned and character‑particular. The borrowed‑memory flashes create a credible tug between isolation and sudden belonging. His final choice (pressing the Edelweiss and recommitting to the light) feels like an earned renunciation of pure solitude with a felt cost. Minor note: the inner contradiction is gently rendered rather than sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive is clear and consistent—loneliness braided with a truth‑seeking compulsion—and his choices under pressure (trusting the ants, fitting the chip) align with that. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, especially the cartographic lens on perception. Internal contradiction is mild (frustration vs. resolve) rather than deeply conflictual, keeping this just short of top tier. The final repricing of loneliness feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (protecting her kingdom and child while confronting her disenchantment) is clear and embodied through the brutal climb and the decision to face the grotto. Contradictory impulses—weariness vs. responsibility/love—coexist on the page. Her micro-choices track (continuing inward despite dizziness; addressing the fissure with quiet authority). The only softness is that her power manifests swiftly without prior testing, blunting visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to “capture the density of presence”) collides credibly with the relational cost of Kael’s news, and her renunciation is earned by the failed vial attempt. Contradictory impulses—alchemical control versus embodied presence—act simultaneously in scene. Micro‑choices (uncorking/capping the vial, handing over the shell, the final “I’m here”) reveal a value hierarchy under pressure. Kael’s sparse dialogue carries real weight and sharpens her change without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied: ink scarred bark, soot‑thickened water, the cabin’s damp smoke carry the psychic pressure. Contradictory impulses—envy of the unburdened self vs. the need to make meaning—operate simultaneously and drive her micro‑choices (write vs. succumb). The final admission “I see you. I miss you.” feels earned by prior envy and costs her the illusion of innocence. No safety‑hedging; the flaw is integrated and transformed rather than erased.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—she seeks silence, notices Chen’s hands and the screw, then chooses the quiet act of polishing the bowl. The conflicting impulses (naming the grief vs. protecting it; her lost scent-world vs. presence) operate in-scene. The renunciation (not mentioning the screw) feels earned and costs her the relief of directness. One line (“She finally understood how to humanize her own silence”) edges toward summary, but it’s supported by on‑page action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive (earn his sigil, avoid fraud) is clear, embodied through his crystallizing affliction and the tactile choice to abandon tea for runes. Contradictory impulses (panic vs. ritual focus) play simultaneously on the page. The transformation from scholar-in-doubt to storyteller-with-a-compass is earned through specific acts and memory-charged inscription. Minor neatness in the self-reframing (“not a curse but a compass”) slightly tidies the ambiguity but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (deliver an overdue apology before dawn) are clear and drive concrete micro‑choices (jury‑rigging wires, flipping the switch, framing her apology in his idiom). Her gossip‑column past versus present exorcist role creates a live contradiction she negotiates in scene. The acceptance that she cannot stop the cutting but will plant saplings reads as an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Emotional texture is specific and embodied without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias aims to unify laws and expose deception—and his choices (reading, then aligning the dictionary with the fissure) track to that goal. Interiority leans abstract but is character‑specific (“end of history witness,” “ancient sorrow”) with some embodied cues. Internal conflict exists but remains gentle; the piece could use one sharper contradictory impulse under pressure. The final shift from witness to weaver reads earned but the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation—to grasp what clocks truly measure—is clear and carries the scene, and his ritual choices (whistle, key, counting) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is character‑particular via tactile, craft‑rooted details (hydraulics, asymmetrical key), grounding the lyric impulse. The change—reframing time as a boundary measured in heartbeats—feels earned by the accumulative build. Slight lack of contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity harmonize rather than clash) keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s duty-versus-curiosity conflict is clear and localized to concrete micro‑choices (intercepting, pressing, handing over the tool). The turn to “allowing growth” is motivated but arrives a touch easily, with limited visible cost beyond relinquishing the pointer and old protocols. Interiority is mostly particular (spatial intuition, tactile engagement with the button) but drifts into generalized realizations at the end. The relationship with the stranger functions as catalyst rather than crucible, limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradictions—rigorous probabilist vs. daughter seeking meaning—are concretely dramatized through tactile choices (boarding the subway to “read” scrawls, bringing the lantern). The old woman and the father apply targeted relational pressure that exposes blind spots. The realization at bedside feels earned by the subway beats, not granted for free. A trace of neatness in the final reconciliation slightly softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s contradiction—curating estrangement while aching for connection—animates credible choices, especially his refusal when Elena seeks him. Embodied detail (hum in his teeth, cool disc) grounds emotion. The cost of his rule is legible at the end. Slight over-articulation of his “mission” edges toward stated thesis but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and embodied in precise micro‑choices (pressing the flower, addressing the teens, giving the vellum away). Contradictory impulses—grief and defiant tenderness—coexist on the page and culminate in an earned renunciation. The archivist vocation is integrated into action rather than label. Cost is emotional and social rather than material, but it’s felt.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aris’s contradiction—desperately jocular exterior versus raw ache—reads cleanly in action and voice, with the cracked spectacles and forced jokes grounding him in specific embodiment. His micro‑choices (overpaying beans, tracing rumors, palming the moon rock, finally convening the circle) align with the loneliness motive. The shift from frantic catalysis to vulnerable presence is earned and forecloses the fantasy of a potion. Secondary figures pressure him credibly without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (locating the stillpoint to anchor grief) is clear and active, and her embodied perception creates a specific, character‑particular interiority. Contradictory impulses—panic as the constellation pause thins versus her brother’s counsel to surrender—surface in scene and guide choices. The tactile mapmaking and note‑reading yield credible micro‑choices (following the ring west, digging when the needle points down). The epiphany skirts neatness but is earned through the cumulative sensory ordeal rather than declared early.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and flaw (driven to repair a past mistake while doubting outcomes) are clear and embodied in precise micro‑choices—unbending the nib, writing sparingly, targeting the botanist’s hesitation. Contradictory impulses (“confidently uncertain”) operate in scene and guide tactics. Emotional texture is concrete (station groans, starlight warps) rather than label‑only. The visible personal cost is modest (accepting ambiguity, draining the pen) but credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive—to honor and render silence—drives every action, with embodied, specific behavior (empty Leica framing, chalking durations) revealing her values under pressure. The joy/sorrow braid at the flute moment reads earned rather than declared. Kael’s influence is cleanly dramatized through tactile exchanges (pressing the camera; bringing the flute), not exposition. If there’s a limit, internal contradiction is modest; she rarely wavers beyond the final bittersweet acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—preserving knowledge at personal cost—is clear and consistent, with the arsonist/guardian tension giving her a credible inner contradiction. Embodied details (“volcanic tenderness,” the charcoal stick, ash) keep emotions grounded. The final renunciation—choosing secrecy—earns its weight. A few declarative self-positionings (“She wasn’t a criminal; she was a guardian.”) flatten nuance slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystalline and urgent—reviving Lyra’s vision—and every tactic (the coded drumming, ignoring prompts) reveals character under pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied (“drumming on the pulse‑point of her own wrist”) rather than diagnostic. The quiet defiance versus the risk of neural overload gives a real internal contradiction. The Earned Stasis at the end (choosing to remain, fingers remembering the rhythm) lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s competence, ethos (“whispers travel farther than shouts”), and gait-reading are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices under pressure. The interiority is efficiently embodied (mimicking walks, pebble flick) rather than explained. Internal contradiction is light—this is more an earned stasis/validation than a fraught change—so the emotional cost remains modest. Still, actions consistently align with motive and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guardian’s motive is crystalline and embodied through patient, precise action; the child’s shift from trembling to wonder reads as a credible, earned response. Interiority is largely externalized via image rather than thought, which limits contradiction and layered self‑deception. Still, micro‑choices (mirror angle, shutter width, when to stop) reveal values under pressure. The restraint from speaking functions as character-specific ethos rather than a generic silence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to seed doubt—reads clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete choices (sneaking out, installing cards, comforting the girl). Interiority is embodied (mist on skin, the thrum in bones) and character‑particular. Internal contradiction is modest (resolve over fear); the piece could show greater live ambivalence under risk. The closing gesture with the pawn credibly reconfigures her role from covert agitator to caretaker without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and character‑particular: shame and longing converge into a choice catalyzed by the whalesong and scrimshaw. Interiority is embodied (gills blooming, salt that heals) with a lived tension between belonging and fear. The struggle feels a touch too smooth at the crest—she yields quickly once the call arrives—so contradiction doesn’t fully bite. Still, the final renunciation (leaving the docks) lands as an earned, costed change.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—cultivating lightness within forbidden grief—is clear and governs each micro‑choice (whittling, narrating, refusing the porch light). The internal conflict is active on the page in her “morally ambiguous” hush versus civic obligation. Her exchange with Mrs. Gable shows status pressure and subtext without collapsing into declaration. The final endurance choice (accepting report risk) credibly forecloses a safer path.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—reclaiming a forbidden art to dissolve sacred boundaries—is lucid and consistently enacted through concrete micro‑choices (seeking the angle where shadow meets quartz, pressing her palm to shadow rather than stone). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (“tremor of certainty”), but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers. Competence predominates and the path feels unopposed, softening the felt cost. Still, her actions align cleanly with her aesthetics‑driven purpose and yield a credible endurance/change.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clean and specific—Lysander’s colorblind pursuit of beauty leads to the risky barter. His interiority is embodied through tactile noticing and tool use rather than labels. Relationship dynamics with Elara carry subtle status play and respect. The inner contradiction (longing for color vs. commitment to texture) is present but could press harder in the waiting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is precise and embodied—she wants to “discover the texture of connection,” and her micro‑choices (mounting the lens, humming C‑sharp, moving to the bell) align under pressure. The internal tension between restoring an audible past and accepting connection as a felt presence lands in the closing renunciation. Emotions are rendered through tactility (dust, warmth, bone‑deep thrumming) rather than labels. The cost is gentle but credible: she relinquishes the fantasy of simple technological recovery for presence with felt grief.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s grief, guilt, and need to pivot from memorializing to cultivating are concrete and drive every choice. Contradictory impulses—despair vs. fragile purpose—coexist on the page, especially when she hits a renewed low and chooses to act anyway. Embodied details (calloused finger, tears, the groaning gears) keep emotions grounded. The visible cost is mainly emotional and reputational risk rather than material, but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s methodical, scholar‑skeptical cartomancer is vivid and consistent; Maya’s arc from ragged despair to engaged curiosity reads true. Motivation (mapping cultural stress) cleanly drives Elara’s choices. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the on‑page cost to either character is subdued, tilting toward serenity over struggle. The relationship dynamic is present but not pressured enough to force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive is clear and pressure-tested: risk self-erasure to purify nostalgia. Interiority is embodied and specific (dust on the tongue, jagged steps, claps) with credible contradictory impulses—she feels the pull of memory yet denies narrative. Micro-choices under stress reveal values and cost. Slight idealization of competence is tempered by palpable struggle and trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the shape of hope—is clear and embodied through tactile anchors (the river stone) and precise, task-driven choices. Her discovery that her curation helped seed the shadow creates a credible internal turn and cost. The decision to let the shadow metamorphose rather than fight it reads as an earned renunciation. Slight limitation: the struggle feels largely cognitive and controlled, with minimal on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty to report vs. compassion for a traumatized animal—are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (misting electrolytes, patient breath, meticulous documentation). The tail tip discovery reframes her belief and tightens her motives credibly. Emotions are embodied and particular; no therapy‑speak shortcuts. The final stance (report and heal, not release yet) feels earned and carries cost (admitting her lapse, delaying freedom).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s drive (closure-seeking surgeon haunted by his daughter) is precise and embodied, and his actions—coffee-ring divination, the painful ivy tunnel, the final renunciation—align with that flaw under pressure. Contradictory impulses (compulsion to “open” vs. dawning refusal) operate simultaneously on the page. The choice to accept the loss of telepathy and stop reopening others’ scars reads earned and costly. A hair shy of perfect because the epiphany edges toward tidy articulation in the last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—she comes to locate and save unused love—and her actions consistently align with that drive. Interiority is sensorial and embodied (lilacs, tear‑stained paper), though contradictory impulses are limited; she rarely hesitates beyond the brief incubation pause. The final choice to carry the love within herself reads as an earned endurance with a conceptual cost. A sharper on‑page tug between personal risk and mission would have deepened complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive—to free creativity trapped in the archway—is clear, embodied, and carried through precise actions (aligning the astrolabe, tracing meteors). Her interiority is vivid and particular (“shadowed rapture,” grief for lost making). Contradictory impulses are mild (awe vs. sorrow) but present in the ecstatic-melancholic blend under pressure. The visible cost (collapse from exhaustion) earns the final endurance/rest beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s vigilance, ritual with the clock, and pivot from fixing the archive to tending spores read as character-specific and motivated. The internal contradiction—guardian of dead futures versus cultivator of new light—lands credibly. Embodied details (the clock’s cold metal, the dune’s “broken glass” song) make his emotions concrete. The cost is subtle but present: he relinquishes mastery/control for caretaking and finally sleeps.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s longing to reclaim her “wild frontier” is specific and embodied, and her micro‑choices (placing the gear on her chest; inserting it into the pulley) align with that drive. The internal contradiction—civilized armor vs. untamed clarity—registers through tactile, sensory noticing. The epiphany lands a touch neatly, with little resistance or genuine risk displayed in the moment. Emotional cost is more conceptual than felt, slightly softening the turn’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—seeking unused courage after the leash of fear snaps—is clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (choosing the winding path, surrendering the ticket, pressing her palm into the star depression). Interiority is specific, embodied by tactile images (mist, creaking wood, black sand). Internal contradiction is mild; she feels “free and adrift,” but the ambivalence rarely sharpens into active friction. The final shift from seeking to carrying reads earned, though the cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—reckoning with the cost of safety—remains coherent and specific, and her micro‑choices (stopping at the discoloration, pocketing/placing the bolt, choosing to remain) align with that drive. Contradictory impulses (penance vs hope; leaving vs staying) coexist credibly on the page. Embodied details—tingling nerves, muffled steps—anchor emotion in the body. A few declarative insights verge on summary rather than dramatized struggle, slightly softening peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivations are clean and consistent—Aris as custodian of truth, Varek’s brittle entitlement, Elara’s hesitant courage—but interior contradiction is light. Aris’s “regally unpretentious” stance shapes nonviolent choices and aligns with the quiet reveal. We get embodied tells (ink, hands, bow) yet little true internal conflict under peak pressure. The final renunciation of force is credible, if not hard‑won by doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motive is clear and continuous—he must understand the vanishing paths—and his embodied habits (the tapping practice) root his interiority in action. The piece shows credible frustration escalating to a somber acceptance, an earned endurance. Internal contradiction (anchored to duty yet unmoored from hope) is present but remains mostly thematic rather than dramatized in a hard choice. Still, actions align with motive and culminate in a costed renunciation of easy hope.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to reframe the rebellion against despair) is clear and embedded in embodied action—bare feet on permacrete, aligning the glasses, submitting to the hum. The internal tension—violence vs an “older” power—is present, if mostly articulated rather than contested under direct pressure. Micro-choices track to her values and culminate in a credible renunciation of fury. The felt cost is modest but legible: a pivot from martial victory to patient, communal reawakening.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—refusing calcified tradition after catastrophe—is clear and consistent, and her choice to unseal the embryo grows credibly from it. Interiority is embodied (heat, tremors, plant‑whispers) with a concrete moral calculus. The internal contradiction (honor tradition by changing it) is present but lightly contested; the scene skews competent with limited struggle. A sharper on‑page cost or falter under pressure would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are embodied: the freeze, the deliberate reach for the photo, the sensory grounding, and the return to planting reveal a credible, costly endurance. The trauma is dramatized through physical cues rather than labels, though a few terms (“somatic markers,” “pearl of stillness”) flirt with therapy‑speak. Micro‑choices under pressure are clear and aligned with her values. The final refusal to surrender reads as earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive—repairing her fractured artistic self—is concrete and escalates as she handles the tarot. Contradiction is alive: avoidance vs. surrender, control vs. acceptance, and she pays a cost by re‑entering the trauma (“feeling the heat of the flames”). Micro‑choices (isolating The Tower, then The World) reveal a values hierarchy. The final renunciation of perfection and choice to descend lands as an earned shift, not a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s motives are urgent and consistent, and her micro‑choices (inducing panic, deploying the drone, pushing through photosensitivity) align with a coherent, embodied interiority. The “serene anger” registers as a lived contradiction—cool control alongside self‑harmful recall. A slight dock for a few declarative labels that flatten complexity (“This was the cruel truth she sought”). Overall, her endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (spark conversation vs. fear of cryo‑punishment) is clear and escalates credibly into decisive action. Embodied detail (trembling hands, chill seeping) grounds interior conflict; the pod choice shows value hierarchy under pressure. A touch of label repetition (“bravely conflicted,” “contraband truths”) edges toward telling, but her micro‑choices remain specific. The ending’s shift from conflict to resolution feels earned by prior steps.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s pacifism in tension with her father’s violent legacy is concrete and enacted under pressure; the sheathing choice reads as an earned renunciation with visible risk. Interiority is specific (leaf angles, strut tremor), and action aligns with motive. The felt cost is kneeling under a raised rifle to protect seedlings. Slight softness: the raiders’ retreat comes quickly, trimming some grit from the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—saving the village’s lullabies—and actions stem cleanly from it. The interiority is concrete (“cool-headed fisher…for echoes”), with credible contradictory impulses (calm fear vs. desperate hope). Micro-choices under pressure (the spike strike, zigzag, grounding, the final cast) reveal values. The only softness is cost: he succeeds without a visible personal loss beyond exertion and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation—truth versus filial loyalty—drives concrete micro‑choices (the pen, the columns, the call) and her embodied perception is character‑specific. The regret over firing Ben counterweights her competence, giving the decision a moral bite. The internal contradiction is present but resolves a touch too cleanly, with limited felt cost on the page. Still, her traits (devoted observation, newsroom upbringing) credibly compel the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, embodied motive (to hush guilt) threads through concrete choices, culminating in the risky tether ritual. Interiority is specific (amber, Lyra, “meteor hush”) and not therapy‑speak. The coincidence of finding precisely relevant letters is a slight softener, but Aris’s agency remains primary. The ending earns an endurance shift, not a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (finding meaning in the mess) is clear and her socially perceptive read of the room credibly triggers her choice to act through the mandala. Interiority is particular enough—her ache and hesitation register—without lapsing into therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction (unease yet acting) is present but mild, with limited felt cost beyond a tear and the mandala’s impermanence. Secondary figures (Torin, Lissa) reflect pressure but do not complicate her choice in a way that escalates cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivation and ethos (“gentle radical,” warmth wrapped in steel) drive every action from debris-sifting to confronting Varr. Interiority is embodied through tactile details (ash, cool ceramic biting his palm) and specific values. The main lack is a sharper on‑page cost or contradiction; he never wavers much, so complexity is strong but not maximal. The status dynamic with Varr briefly deepens character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—mend one shard before demolition—drives each choice, and her synesthetic interiority yields concrete, character‑particular perception. Her decisive act (choosing to save the boy rather than herself) aligns with the established values and reveals a credible hierarchy under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she balances desperation with tenderness, hope with the acceptance she can’t fix everything. The felt afterstate (nostalgia replacing crushing failure) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation (not redemption but an urgent need to “illuminate hidden pathways”) is clean, character‑particular, and enacted by micro‑choices (muscle‑tensing to sharpen beams). His affectionate skepticism versus complicity in Synapse creates credible tension and a felt cost. Lena applies real, scene‑level pressure and shifts from doubt to resolve, enriching the crucible. The final renunciation of telepathy in favor of embodied understanding reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—mapping and “becoming the voice of the unknown”—is clear and intensifies as the fossil’s role reconfigures her task. Interiority is concrete (visor fog, panic regulated by the fossil) with a credible tension between private talisman and communal beacon. Her choice to reframe her maps and release exclusive ownership reads earned. Minor neatness in the self-narration (“factual mysticism”) trims some rawness but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to reprice the prophecy from doom to possibility—is clear and consistently embodied in choices (arranging buttons, turning hourglasses, deciding to descend with a map). Interiority is specific and tactile (“Buttons remember what voices forget”), though internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers beyond brief recollection of elders’ warnings. The felt cost (defying elders, the burden of responsibility) is present but understated. Still, action aligns with motive and the final stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear (redeem trust, mend self) and actions align, with embodied fear and resolve (“each movement was deliberate”). The internal contradiction—caution vs. daring—plays out credibly in the snow‑coding and the decision to proceed despite the warning. The daughter/pillbox memory personalizes stakes without derailing the present. Minor neatness in the “unused courage” phrasing edges toward tidy but remains earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s competence, vow, and tactile decision-making are vivid and consistent; his attentiveness and the needle habit concretize motive into action. Internal contradiction is limited—he rarely falters—so pressure reveals craft more than character fracture. Still, micro‑choices (closing eyes to “percolate,” repairing rope under stress, minute tiller correction) feel embodied and particular. The gratitude exchange lands as earned endurance rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaito’s motive (to understand why some places resist change) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—aligning the glass, shielding the lavender, placing the river stone, deciding to carry the shard—reveal values under quiet pressure. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft memory and sensation (“thrum” through his bones). The main limitation is low contradiction; his zen steadiness rarely meets friction that forces a harder trade-off. Still, the endurance/renunciation (accepting the wasteland’s persistence) reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—repurposing craft to cast light into danger—reads specific and embodied, and her “wistfully pragmatic” stance coheres with tactile micro-choices (placing shards, testing angles). Internal contradiction is subtle but present: elegiac acceptance of loss versus active defiance through labor. The cat and the remembered locksmith sharpen her values without diluting focus. Stakes remain intimate; no glaring blind spot or unearned leap.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s goal—stabilize the Aethon flood and transmute isolation into independence—is clear, urgent, and consistently embodied (molars buzzing, throat bled). Contradictory impulses (yearning for connection vs. terror of shattering) operate in scene and drive her to risk the dawn ignition. Micro‑choices (descending, aligning the gnomon, ear to stone, holding through the surge) reveal values under pressure. The final acceptance reads earned, with a visible cost in pain and relinquished isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s yearning and contradiction—curating others’ intimacy while feeling hollow—are convincingly embodied, culminating in the risky, specific act of writing “I want to belong.” The shift from ghostwriter to facilitator aligns with her “keeper of secrets” identity and costs her anonymity. Interiority is precise and textured, not abstract. The epiphany from the nest skirts convenience but is grounded by tactile action the next day.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motive—protect the truth of the signal—drives concrete, risky action, and his “cautiously hopeful” stance threads decisions under pressure. Interiority is particular (spectral lines, grounding schematics) and embodied by tactile choices (rerouting power, bypassing safeties). Internal contradiction is present but light; he largely suppresses institutional anxiety to focus on craft. The moral cost (breaking protocols, risking shutdown) lands and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motives—duty versus claustrophobic dread—drive micro‑choices (“prudence meant moving slow… adventure demanded she push forward”). The internal contradiction holds in scene and guides tactics. Her restraint with the booby‑trap check earns the final grab and reads character‑true. Minor reliance on familiar images (“heart… like a trapped bird”) slightly lowers distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motive (reviving empathy for Clara) is clear, embodied by her ritual precision and the constraint of prosopagnosia. Interiority is specific (mist density, paces, texture of silk) and actions align with her limits. Contradictory impulses are present but muted (guilt/failure vs. method), so the peak choice feels steadier than conflicted. The small on‑page relationship moment with the man reveals values credibly without overexposure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—clearing her grandfather’s name—drives every beat, with embodied contradiction (sticky fingers, “spongey dread” vs. steady voice) under pressure. The micro‑choice that matters—holding, reading, and finally reinterpreting the nail—aligns with her librarian/mapmaker competence. The decision to stay in a failing station forecloses an easier path with a felt cost. A slight neatness to the epiphany trims messiness of human error, but it remains credible.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”—and his choices (reading the tarp, committing to the descent, playing the closing note) align under pressure. Interiority is concrete via tactile anchors (glass flake biting, shale shifting). Internal contradiction is thin—he moves decisively with little hesitation—so complexity feels slightly underdeveloped. Still, actions reveal character with credible cost and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—urge to flee vs. the practiced, deliberate calm—are embodied in tactile choices (opening the satchel for charcoal and a map, not the money). His father’s shadow informs present action without absolving him, and the renunciation of escape reads as a credible cost. Interiority stays concrete and character‑particular. A faint neatness to the final acceptance keeps it just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive (decode before monsoon; make sense of Kael’s last message) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is grounded in tactile action (telescope, spectrograph, telegram). The internal shift from solitary burden to communal witnessing feels earned by the dream’s ritual and the star-decoding. Minor softness: the epiphany risks tidiness (“Carry not alone,” “We lift together”) without much resistance on the page. Still, motive → action → reconfiguration tracks credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive (to repair a curse he caused) is clear and compels concrete, escalating choices; his “warlike serenity” undercuts panic in a character‑specific way. Interiority is embodied through tactile actions (expanding circles, vine grip) rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction—calm soldier’s focus vs buried shame—surfaces credibly at the shattering confession. A slightly deeper on‑page tug between saving the lake and fear of exposing himself could have raised the charge further.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive is clear and embodied—she bleeds, plants, and risks to reweave the covenant—and her “anxious elation” under pressure feels character‑specific. Contradictory impulses (hope/terror; bondage/communion) are present but not deeply stress‑tested. Micro‑choices (prick thumb, “heed the silence,” plant the clipping) align with motive and escalate commitment. The cost is visible (blood, years rooted, only a partial step), though the struggle edges toward assured ritual success.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is vivid and consistent—reckless idealism yoked to tender care—and her micro-choices (carving, binding meanings, accepting the roots) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The embodied details (thumb smoothing the card, the lullaby) keep emotion textured and specific. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (fierce gentleness vs. compulsion to “trammel fate”), landing as Earned Stasis rather than revelation. No false tidy epiphany; the visible cost of endurance reads.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rich, embodied interiority grounds Liam’s motives—his fact‑shielding and grief collide credibly with the tactile appraisal habit. The micro‑choice to keep the cloth is earned by the re-seeing of its specifics (blue gel, heat puckering). Contradictory impulses (professional duty vs. personal resonance) operate simultaneously. The shift stops short of messiness about the ethical cost, but remains believable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motives are clear and consistently enacted through precise, gentle, scholar-specific micro‑choices (aligning sensors, following the tablet’s sequence). His emotions are embodied (obsidian lenses, cool glass, crystalline leaves) and his grief/longing complicates his competence. The internal contradiction—mechanistic understanding vs unreachable essence—lands in the final beats. Slight shortfall: in‑scene counter-impulses are muted rather than actively clashing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s duty-fatigue versus devotion creates a credible tension, and her micro-choices (feeding metal to the forge, transcribing with brass, deciding to “let them flow”) align with her motive. Embodied details (spectacles’ coordinates, sluggishness under a waning moon) ground her internal state. The change is an earned stasis: she recommits to a costly, humble routine rather than a grand fix. Slight safety remains—no real risk of refusal—keeping it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s mandate, professional detachment, and felt response to the pearl create a credible internal conflict that culminates in a motivated refusal to sign. Interiority is concrete (the molar-vibrating hush, the cold stone, the journals) and his micro-choices track under pressure. A few abstractions (“walls between hearts”) edge into told theme rather than strictly dramatized impulse. The final renunciation carries a plausible professional cost and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, urgent motivation (self-forgiveness) drives embodied choices: maps spread on a splintered bench, the wheeze of patched bellows, the journal line that renounces control. Contradictory impulses (method vs surrender, medication dam vs raw grief) are dramatized rather than declared. The change—choosing to “flow” and to document healing—feels earned and costly. A few aphoristic lines skim therapy-speak, but the concrete beats keep it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and method are clear and character‑specific, with embodied actions (kneeling to the floor, syncing the reversed watch) that reveal her meticulous, driven nature. The “cautious exuberance” reads as a credible tension between risk and hope. However, we don’t see a hard, costly choice on the page—her conflict with the implied price of the second letter remains anticipatory. The piece ends in charged poise rather than a motivated renunciation or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (protective idealism vs. pragmatic capitulation) are clear and intensify under pressure, culminating in a costly renunciation. Interiority is embodied and specific (“mulberry ache,” tactile gardening pain) with credible contradictory impulses (play to shatter will vs. surrender to protect the idea). Micro-choices—propagating by splitting the root, taking only a drop, handing over the violin—reveal values under duress. Vorlag’s brief on‑page presence cleanly pressures a final stance without diluting Elara’s centrality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and embodied in action—profession, duty, and grief align into a focused aim. The urgency of “Now” grows credibly from her method of attunement. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she executes without a complicating blind spot or competing impulse. The endurance at the end reads earned but not morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and temperament are clear and consistent; her micro‑choices (climb to think, harvest before dawn, arrange the ritual) express a particular, embodied caretaker’s logic. Internal tension—grace granted yet contentment elusive—registers but rarely pressures her into visibly costly trade‑offs. The hairpin efficiently reveals wound and stance without melodrama. The closing acceptance feels earned, though the path offers minimal friction or contradictory impulse under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction is vivid and embodied: a “conscience for hire” who weaponizes doubt yet suffocates under it. Micro‑choices (touching the clasp, raising the shard) track a credible progression from avoidance to surrender. The Mrs. Gable memory sharpens his flaw without overexplaining. A slight whiff of tidy self‑diagnosis near the end trims the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—teaching through withholding—drives every beat and her backward aging provides tangible cost. Kael’s frustration and dawning comprehension give the relationship a credible crucible. Interiority is present but skims toward aphorism at moments (“Truth must be earned, not given”), softening contradiction. Still, actions align cleanly with motives and the final renunciation (she vanishes into youth) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is crisp and consistent—he seeks to navigate without moving—and his micro-choices (shifting from skimming stones to appraising the arrowhead; returning it) align with that aim. Interiority feels embodied (dust, bone resonance) rather than labeled. The internal conflict is subtle rather than oppositional; stakes ride on endurance and renunciation more than contradictory impulses. The final renunciation reads earned but low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—seeking the sacred beyond the Engines—drives concrete choices (returning the keystone, mist walking, discarding her pack). Interiority is embodied (cold ache, trembling) and character‑specific. Minor over‑articulation (“She would never again mistake automation for art”) trims ambiguity and slightly tidies the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motive—discovering the color of sound—anchors every choice and stays legible through concrete acts (descending, decoding, testing vows). Interiority is specific (synesthesia, the grandmother’s riddle) but shows limited contradictory impulses under pressure; fear, doubt, or competing values rarely interfere. The closing renunciation is quiet but earned: he closes the book and accepts an inward compass at a cost of leaving mysteries submerged for now. Strong, if more gravitas under strain could deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (guiding the colony via ritualized randomness) is clear and consistent, with credible contradictory impulses—quiet enthusiasm versus “stellar doubt.” Micro‑choices under pressure (casting lots, selecting the most chaotic burst, adjusting prisms, repurposing the coins) reveal values. The interiority is embodied through tactile ritual (water over coins, ambered deck) rather than label‑only feeling. The visible cost is modest (risk of trusting entropy and abandoning doubt), so the turn feels slightly easy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief-driven motive is clear and particular, filtered through tactile actions (handling the atlas, arranging it in light). Interiority is textured and embodied, not label-only, and the reaper vocation is integrated rather than decorative. The internal conflict is present but modest—resolve leans more toward devotion than a live tug-of-war. The closing acceptance feels earned by prior choices, though the visible cost is primarily emotional and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clean and particular—brittle devotion paired with modest power—and his micro‑choices (matching breath to a five‑second pulse) arise from that. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (cold, the bell like a dead child), avoiding stock therapy‑speak. Contradiction is present (lukewarm power vs. cosmic task; naivete vs. dawning doubt) though not deeply dramatized in clash on the page. The endurance ending feels earned with a visible cost (exhaustion and only “time” bought).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and escalate—from vigilant duty to a personal imperative to break inherited silence. Her embodied choices (descending the mud, prying the tin, accepting tears) reveal a textured interior. The contradiction between guarding and revealing resolves credibly into a costly vow. No false epiphany; the photos earn the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—harmonizing logic and intuition before the elixir’s final transformation—is clear and embodied (flame trembling, locket pressed to palm). The internal contradiction is dramatized in the heat/caution hesitation and resolved through a specific, character‑driven choice (a controlled golden thread of fire). Change lands credibly with a foreclosed path (brute force) and a felt cost (abandoning her self‑protective disdain for intuition). The epiphany via starlings skirts convenience but is grounded in her prior mathematical attention.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving trust under pressure—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (climb, re‑thread, test). The piece leans into competence over contradiction, offering little internal friction beyond fatigue and memory of a colleague’s panic. Embodied emotion lands via texture (sweat, sway, cold metal) rather than labels. The ending commits to Earned Stasis, but the personal cost is modestly sketched (exhaustion, ongoing burden) rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s numbness-as-wall is embodied and motivates concrete choices, culminating in choosing connection at real emotional cost (tears, vulnerability). His internal contradiction—void versus yearning to feel—operates in-scene. Kael is one-note but applies credible pressure that reveals Aris. A touch of told motivation (“His motivation was clear”) slightly flattens interiority early.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motive—safeguarding space for innovation—is clear and consistent, and his choices (where to plant, to guard it, to redesign the room) align. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he weighs options but rarely faces a painful trade-off. Interiority is specific enough to read as his, but much is asserted rather than dramatized through embodied tension. The final stance is earned but low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—to tend and transmute household grief—drives every action, and her embodied choices (yanking cords, singing into wind) align with that aim. The “mournfully eager” tension reads specific rather than generic. Internal contradiction (hurt vs. hope; ritualized control vs. helpless loss) is present, though lightly stated rather than dramatized as a sharp, on‑page clash. The final easing of her shoulders registers a credible cost and earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—rigid boundary-keeping versus the urge to “make friends with uncertainty”—are dramatized in concrete action when she first recoils from the pendant and then chooses to integrate its energy. Embodied detail (paw trapped by ice, burning touch) keeps emotions grounded. The final renunciation (tending thresholds rather than fortifying walls) forecloses her prior tactic with a felt, character‑specific cost. A minor softness is the neatness of the realization stated in near‑thesis terms.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s stoic sensitivity is dramatized through embodied choices—the near-throw of the shard, then the gentler “feel the heat’s pulse” pivot. Motivation (interrupting failure) coherently compels tactics and endurance across attempts. The interior contradiction (calm exterior vs. aching pressure) stays active in scene rather than labeled. The closing acceptance of a fragile, transient success reads as an earned reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her shift from filtering to resonating reads earned. Interiority is specific (tuning to “hush,” refusing safety protocols), though contradictory impulses under pressure are muted. Embodied detail (boots on grating, shard’s weight/heat) supports character. The felt cost is modest, so the endurance/renunciation beat lands more as conviction than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Leo’s motivation is clear and consistent—save the ferry by merging timelines—and his competence under pressure is convincing. Interiority surfaces in tactile ways (trembling hands, tuning by starlight), but inner contradiction is minimal; he rarely falters or doubts. The relationship pressure with Captain Mara functions as operational coordination more than a crucible, keeping emotional complexity modest. The ending’s endurance stance (he stays, work continues) reads as earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive (to “discover the texture of connection”) is clear and tested under pressure, and her professional competence collides credibly with responsibility when the man says, “It hurts.” Interiority is embodied via the sinew thread’s feel and the gallery’s hum; she makes a costly, specific choice—sharing the thread and co‑weaving—to accept moral burden. The internal contradiction (control vs. the necessary pain of connection) surfaces in the shift from thinly rationalizing to active receiving. A touch of explanatory phrasing (“She’d sought connection but ignored its cost”) slightly overstates what the scene already earns.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motive—translating drowned starlight into navigation—reads concrete and coherent, and his teaching stance reveals character through action. The tactile bond with the chain anchors interiority in the physical. However, internal conflict is light; “balanced curiosity” reduces friction where a sharper contradiction might deepen stakes. The micro‑turn arrives via Kael’s skepticism, but the cost to Aris remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and profession are crisply defined, and her inner tension between “assuring” and “chasing ghosts” drives the pivotal breach of procedure. Embodied reactions (the earpiece’s warmth, the mist, the thrum) anchor her choices. However, her competence faces little pushback or cost beyond urgency, so the arc reads slightly tidy. Lily and the mother serve as pressure but do not substantially complicate Elara’s decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arden’s motive (retrieve Vale’s notes to honor the unremembered) is clear and coherently drives each choice under rising pressure. Her claustrophobia is embodied and credibly degrades perception and tactics as the tide returns. Micro-choices (plunging hands into icy water, forcing the hatch, deciding to run) reveal hierarchy of values. A slight neatness in the closing resolve (“keeper of echoes”) trims some ambiguity but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—retrieve meaning from collapse—and her heartbeat‑counting habit grounds embodied anxiety. The porcelain‑and‑ink method shows competence under duress without erasing fragility. Internal contradiction exists (fear of erasure vs. choosing to accept corruption) but could press harder. The closing acceptance reads earned, though the cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive is clear and embodied—his copper‑veined duty and tactile focus on bone texture drive every action. Micro‑choices (placing the diamond, shifting to the starlings’ patterns, modulating his hum) reveal a competent, devout practitioner under pressure. Internal contradiction is limited; he rarely wavers or exposes a competing impulse. Still, the final acceptance of loss at a cost (the diamond destroyed) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (find truth, release bitterness) is clear and embodied, and her choice to press the arrowhead to the phone under pressure reveals character. Contradictory impulses—mission-driven skepticism vs. yearning to believe—coexist credibly. The metamorphosis reads earned by prior beats (tape replay, confession, object’s hum). Slight neatness in the final emotional equanimity trims the upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (“to reawaken beauty”) and embodied interiority through the locust shell and heart-syncing ground Elara’s choices. The “gap between knowing and understanding” creates credible internal tension that narrows as she commits. Micro-choices (planting feet, holding the note despite upheaval) reveal values under pressure. The piece could risk more visible personal cost or flaw exposure, but characterization remains strong at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aris’s motive—smuggling hope where treaties fail—is clear and specific, and his “respectfully rebellious” stance generates credible micro‑choices under pressure. Interiority is embodied (satchel weight; bottle cold against ribs) without therapy‑speak. The Elara/Kael letter personalizes the stake and sharpens his resolve at the pinch. Internal contradiction is present but modest (calm voice vs. pounding heart), keeping this short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior is embodied and particular—calloused fingers, ritual routes, and the grief‑made silence—and his decisive break (choosing to sing) is credibly earned by the wind‑bell clock and the fragment’s vibration. The contradiction between his long self‑enforced muteness and his craft of mending pays off when repair becomes sonic. Emotional cost is present on the page (tears, tremor, risk of voice). Minor note: a touch more friction before he sings could heighten felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s obsession and ritualistic competence are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (object selection, spatial mapping, recitation) align with motive. The interiority is specific (scarf-as-compass, equation as “angles and sorrow”) but shows little contradictory impulse or genuine risk wobble in the peak beat. The final stance shift from seeker to guardian reads earned but low-cost. Strong embodiment (scarf tightening, warmth up the spine) anchors emotion without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—finding her sister—drives every choice, from the dawn vigils to the light‑photography and the final departure. Interiority is textured through tactile objects (salt‑fogged lens, chipped palette) and a credible obsession. However, internal contradiction is light; we don’t see competing impulses beyond persistence and hope. The closing choice forecloses comfort (library) for risk (forbidden island), but the felt cost is more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aris’s motive (to free courage) is clear, embodied, and consistent with her “enigmatic locksmith” identity. Her micro‑choices—waiting for Vega, receiving rather than taking, pouring longing—reveal character under pressure. Internal struggle is more implicit than contested; she meets limited resistance, so cost reads modest. Still, the quiet endurance and renunciation of force credibly earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motive and methods are vivid and consistent—“hands‑on folklorist” is dramatized through scraping, diving, and using a sextant. Interiority is concrete (salt‑crusted goggles, trembling glove), and the moment of reframing the witch from thief to guardian reads earned. The internal conflict (resentment vs. yearning) is present but resolved a bit smoothly. Emotional cost is felt but leans gentle rather than thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (win readmission by redeeming a trapped shadow) are clear and embodied in specific behaviors (backward pacing, shard handling), with a credible contradiction in her combative tenderness toward Kael. The mentoring relationship functions as a crucible, producing his insight that forces her shift. Her change—stopping the backward retreat and annotating with his words—feels earned. Minor neatness in the speed of her emotional pivot keeps it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive is crystalline and embodied through tactile craft, and her ache at the memory of the last Wonderbloom gives the ritual a felt price. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or missteps, so pressure reveals little new about her. Competence leads throughout, with resolve more than struggle. The final renunciation (costing pain to seed hope) reads earned, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (grounding the dead through repair) is clear and embodied in her craft, and the brother’s apparition forces a costly, character‑specific confrontation. Contradictory impulses—trembling grief versus steady precision—coexist on the page. Micro‑choices (which knot to tackle, how to release, the lullaby) reveal values under pressure. The final steadying of her hands reads as earned endurance rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s professional mindset and guarded openness are specific and consistent, and her choices (comparing reels, overlaying surveys, clearing ivy, waiting on rain) are well motivated. Interiority is embodied (“breath fogging the lens,” hum through her palms) rather than abstract. The internal contradiction (skepticism vs. welcome for revelation) is present but not deeply stressed under pressure. The emotional turn at the hum feels earned, though the personal cost is quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s grief-driven, quietly analytic mindset is specific and embodied (the tremor, the weight in his chest), and his micro‑choices (extracting the thread, re‑housing the note, returning the globe) reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses—compulsion to seek versus the final renunciation—are present though not deeply contested on the page. The closure choice to leave the globe carries a visible cost and feels earned by his established methods. Slight neatness in how the epiphany arrives via an improbable note keeps this short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to connect with and comfort the lonely code‑ghost while reclaiming her silenced voice—reads specific and consistent. Her grief‑induced muteness versus the choice to sing gives credible internal contradiction. Micro‑choices (using the bolt plate, choosing symbols, finally singing) align with pressure. The cost is emotional exposure rather than bodily risk, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s curiosity and duty conflict cleanly on the page—she opens the diary, keeps reading through the chimes, and pockets the items despite the steward’s frown. Interiority is embodied via tactile details (mint, grandmother’s hands) rather than labels. The final stance shift—carrying secret warmth while performing her role—feels earned. Cost is present but soft (risk of reprimand rather than a sharper consequence).

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, specific interiority ties vocation to grief; her choice to ignore oxygen to secure proof is credible and costly. Contradictory impulses (survival vs. vindication/connection) operate simultaneously in scene. Small moves—the telescope’s focus ring, the decision not to retrieve it—reveal priorities under pressure. Slight sentimentality in the epilogue softens edge but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—preserve the library by mirroring the sky—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (coin sequence, stylus work). Her tactile interiority feels specific and embodied, with competence balanced by genuine limits (the tremor). Internal contradiction is present but modest (ambition vs. exhaustion/limits). Lack of relational pressure keeps the crucible narrow, but it suits the single-POV frame.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑particular, and her tactile, professional noticing grounds her. The interiority is embodied (“calloused fingers,” breath fogging) and her loneliness shades choices. However, internal contradiction is light; she solves cleanly without a palpable self‑conflict testing her values. The final stance shift (isolation sweetened by purpose) feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to learn the rhythm of repair—shapes every micro‑choice, culminating in the renunciation of force for attentive “listening.” Driftwood nostalgia adds a credible counter‑impulse to duty, lending texture without softening stakes. Embodied detail (numb fingers, frost) grounds interiority. The final earned shift—choosing communion over conquest—reads as character‑specific and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation to trust the ghost and mobilize the colony is clear and embodied (frost, bell, sprint to the hub). Interiority is specific—“hope like brambles”—but internal conflict is light; he pivots to belief quickly with minimal ambivalence. Secondary pressures (Anya’s skepticism vs. Renn’s leap) help, though they’re brief. The visible cost is mostly labor and risk of misallocation rather than a sharper sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—redeeming a past failure and safeguarding time through a lullaby—is clear, embodied, and escalates under pressure. His micro-choices (placing the puppet head, committing to the song despite the cost) align with a coherent inner life. Contradictory impulses (despair vs. resolve) are present but lightly rendered rather than dramatized in a charged clash. The visible cost (rapid aging) credibly earns his final endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation (oath-bound necessity) is clear and consistent, and her choices—assembling the path, timing the move—align with it under pressure. The hate/duty tension is credible, though live-on-page inner contradiction could be sharper during the rescue beat. Embodied details (trembling hands, breath impressions) ground the emotion without therapy-speak. The final wondering about her freedom reads earned rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s grief, guilt, and scientific temperament cohere into a clear motive that steers concrete choices (placing the chrysalis, deciding to build self-healing polymers). The interiority is specific to his lens (polymer/foam analogies) and embodied through observation. The shift from punishment to purpose reads earned but smooth; contradictory impulses under pressure are understated, making the turn feel low-friction. Still, the ending’s acceptance carries a credible, ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s want (to find where stories begin) collides credibly with her livelihood as a clean-slate vendor, and her ache around the ‘Waxing Gibbous’ vial grounds emotion in body and object. Her pivot from selling erasure to mapping absence is earned by observation → insight → act. Internal contradiction (comfort in emptiness vs need to carve meaning) is present rather than summarized. A hint of declarative certainty (“her slates were lies”) trims nuance but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive (to “sandpaper” a jagged guilt) is specific, embodied, and tested under pressure when the pavilion’s remorse threatens to drown her. Contradictory impulses—seeking solitude yet choosing to be subsumed—surface in the tactile beats of touch and cooking. Her final choice to transform rather than erase reads earned and costly. Brief, pointed backstory (the apprentice) meaningfully charges each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eliska’s motives are clear and embodied—she listens, decides, acts—and her tactile work with the jammed weight reveals character under pressure. The “empathetically decisive” trait is dramatized rather than told. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little self‑doubt or competing impulse. The dawn exchange with Marek confirms the social vector of her choices but arrives after success, not as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s motive and vocation are clear and embodied—his trembling, tears, and engineered procedures reveal a concrete, idiosyncratic mind under pressure. The internal contradiction is modest: he’s resolute more than conflicted, with little friction between fear and drive beyond the bodily “quaking reverie.” Micro‑choices (injecting the serum, stabilizing the memory flow, choosing to catalog) track cleanly from motive. The closing renunciation—accepting the keeper role—feels earned, though the visible cost is largely emotional rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is crystalline and consistent, and her embodied reactions (the stomach lurch, the time pressure) read true. However, the interior contradiction is minimal: she’s competent and steady, with little friction between fear and purpose. The “latent blaze” registers as drive, not dilemma, which softens the cost of her choice. Strong but not transformative characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aris’s motive—to make music in a world that has gone silent—is vivid and character‑particular, grounded by tactile craft and the teacher’s maxim. Embodied perception (porcelain’s hum, thrum up the spine) reveals a lived practice. The internal contradiction—summoning song at the cost of widening cracks—is present but could be sharpened earlier. Still, actions align cleanly with values and culminate in an earned, tender renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: he values beauty and principle over reinstatement, and his refusal to name the traitor informs the present vow of silence. Embodied tics (the dented worry stone, shadow placement, stance) ground his interiority. However, internal contradiction is modestly dramatized—the struggle reads mostly resolved, so the peak feels low‑friction. The final choice to return with a solution costs him little visibly beyond continued exile.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (recovering the diary to deepen a lifelong ethic of empathy) is clear and consistently dramatized through tactile choices with the tuning forks. Interiority is specific and character‑particular via her taxonomy of silences. Internal contradiction is light—more devotion than struggle—so cost reads primarily as emotional rather than conflicted. Still, the final reorientation toward carrying silence inside feels earned by the scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—mistaking control for serenity—drives concrete choices that later reverse, with the pot’s shattering exposing her flaw. Interiority is sensory‑particular (olfactory cues, tactile seed) and shows contradiction: ambition to master versus the humility to yield. The renunciation—leaving the seed in the crevice—feels earned and costs her control and her prized pot. Minor safety: the insight settles quickly but is backed by on‑page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear goal and competent agency (water‑flow navigation, using the arrow as resonator), with embodied perception under pressure. Internal contradiction is light; awe and focus dominate without much competing impulse. Micro‑choices are present but low‑risk, so the final stance shift reads more contemplative than hard‑won. Effective, but not yet character‑revealing at a deep level.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s professional drive and embodied method read specific and credible, with micro‑choices (Point Alpha/Bravo, recalibration after the container shift) revealing values under pressure. The patch grounds a humane conflict between forensic rigor and grief. Internal contradiction is present but modest—duty versus risk/regret—without a deep rupture. The final vow feels earned by prior observations and the near‑miss.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s motivation (to certify wonder) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it. However, interiority leans declarative and serene rather than conflicted; we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in sensory synesthesia, but much of his state is summarized (calm, charged) instead of dramatized through struggle. The cost—losing the amber sheet—is felt, but his internal trade‑off arrives without much resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—salvaging understanding from a catastrophic failure—is clear and drives each micro‑choice from arranging markers to attempting the flute. Contradictory impulses (control vs surrender) are dramatized, not told, and culminate in an earned renunciation. Embodied detail (calloused fingers, dust‑tasting breath) grounds her interiority. The final choice forecloses a familiar path with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motives are precise and embodied—the drive to “quantify the ache” meets the visceral cost of transposed empathy. Contradictory impulses (control via math vs. surrender to feeling) collide under pressure once the fragment threatens to infect the press. The final renunciation—placing the fragment away and choosing to carry rather than solve—reads earned. Minor hedge: the realization skirts thesis-speak, but the choice itself remains character-grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s fear, loneliness, and duty are embodied (trembling fingers, biting frost) and culminate in a purposeful micro‑choice to kneel and attend to the flower. Contradictory impulses—dread vs. the urge to coax wonder—operate simultaneously and drive action. The change to quiet resolve feels earned by the experience with the pendant and the cost of Vanya’s absence. No false tidiness: the ache remains while resolve clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive (to prove objects absorb emotions) is clear and drives every beat, and her internal contradiction—need for control versus dawning awareness of projection—plays out on the page. Embodiment is strong (forehead to glass, tears freezing), and the renunciation at the end lands with felt cost. A touch of self‑summarizing phrasing (“truthful lies”) edges toward labeling but remains earned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s longing and despair are embodied and motive-driven, culminating in a costly, coherent choice to sacrifice herself. The internal push-pull (weariness vs. duty to “recommence”) is credible and enacted rather than told. Minor limitation: contradictory impulses could be more directly dramatized at the decision beat rather than implied through description.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—coaxing resilience from a broken world—flows organically from his meek, meticulous temperament and his occupation, and it compels the final costly barter. The internal tension (fearful silence vs. determined action) is present though restrained, resolved through the sacrifice of his voice. Embodied perception (wet stone, humming silk, bone-deep tremor) grounds emotion. The change at the end is credible and visibly paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive is precise and embodied: a sensory cartographer pursuing the weight of a hidden truth about Lyra. Micro-choices under pressure (pressing the shard, “redirect” as a tactic, refusing to flee the bay after the near‑strike) reveal her hierarchy of values. The conflict between the impulse to follow and Lyra’s injunction to contain reads on the page. The final acceptance—carrying the truth as compass—feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the lighthouse’s promise when the lamp dies—is clear and embodied through concrete micro‑choices (descending, stone codes, leaving the note and glass). Interiority is specific and filtered through her profession; the “warmly observant” trait shows in what she notices. Internal contradiction is present but muted (helpless to relight vs. compelled to protect), keeping it more steadfast endurance than fraught conflict. The earned renunciation of repairing the lamp tonight in favor of a quieter safeguard reads credible and costs her certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s duty, fear, and stubborn dismissal of omen create credible, contradictory impulses that tighten under storm pressure. Her embodied focus on temperature, angles, and the physical wick grounds interiority in action. The panic at “broken light” and the later conceptual pivot feel earned by prior competence and doubt. Minor safety: the herald is more pressure than relationship, so interpersonal complexity is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to understand story‑magnetism after her transplant—is vivid and consistent, and her dye‑master habits translate into on‑page choices (retrieving the wing, using it as lens). Her internal contradiction (seeking vs. holding still) is dramatized and resolved credibly in the final renunciation. Emotions are embodied through craft‑specific perceptions rather than labels. The change costs her the chase and self‑foregrounding, which reads as earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motives are clear and particular—the ledger, the psoriasis, and the vanished wife give him texture beyond a trope. Interiority is grounded in tactile choices (not touching the sextant pieces; waiting for the moon) with a credible, quiet obsession. The internal turn—accepting witness over literal knowledge—lands, though contradictory impulses are soft on the page. A bit more on the cost of renouncing the exact “seeing” might deepen the felt conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive (“to rekindle the dying realm”) is vivid and embodied—panic, numb fingers, tear on the dust, “poured every ounce”—and her micro‑choices (pivoting from lost “grand hymns” to intimate work songs) reveal character. Internal contradiction is present but light: fear and paralysis give way to agency without a strong cost debate. The closure (committing to the final note) feels earned by the recalls of lullaby/harvest chant, though the price remains mostly exertional. A deeper flaw or tradeoff would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—empathy that compels retreat versus a need to risk connection—are concrete and embodied (panic, the compulsion to hide, smoothing the invitation). Micro-choices track under pressure (drawer labeled “Unprocessed,” step back, then moving to the room’s center). The final stance shift feels earned by prior grief and habitual avoidance. Slight convenience: the inscription answers her fear too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivations (guilt over acquiescence, desire to tend and repair) are concrete and consistent, expressed through tactile choices—eating slowly, planting, opening the locket gently. Contradictory impulses—self‑blame versus care—coexist on the page. The final stance (continuing guerrilla gardening as a form of absolution) feels earned and forecloses a path of passive regret. Slight neatness in the absolution turn keeps it just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—preserve the last luminous vow—is clear and expressed through concrete, meticulous actions under time pressure. Her competence is particularized (precise alignment, balancing grief/resolve) and her nerves register physically, though internal contradiction is modest. The micro‑choices (increasing sensitivity, adjusting angle, prioritizing core truth) reveal values and stakes. Emotional cost is felt, if quietly, in the acceptance of a tomb‑like vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s goal is clear and particular—recording “the sound of trust breaking” before dawn—and her actions (calibrating, raising/ lowering the horn, resetting the cylinder) align under pressure. The tactile fixation on the watch fob grounds emotion. Internal contradiction is modest (resolve vs any qualm about benefiting from violence), keeping her arc more endurance than change. Still, the closing “hollow victory” registers a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motive (to understand carriers) is clear and embodied through sensory vigilance and the ring’s handling. Interiority is textured and specific, though micro-choices are limited to waiting, tightening the ring, and interpretive leaps. The conceptual shift from skeptic to understanding is earned but pays a modest emotional price on the page. Relationships with the carriers do not pressure her directly, keeping conflict largely intrapersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—rectifying a creative paralysis—is clear and continuous, with embodied emotion (charcoal-stained fingers, tears) under pressure. Contradictory impulses (flight from the calling versus surrender to it) act in scene, especially at the lock and when she finally draws. Micro-choices (using a crystal as a pick; choosing the first line) reveal priorities credibly. A touch of on‑the‑nose reflection (“a test—could she fix what was fractured within herself?”) slightly blunts ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (“to find where lost conversations went”) is clear and sustained, and her honesty‑triggered vulnerability produces concrete, character‑specific choices. The Ben beat externalizes her flaw at a cost and sharpens her tactics. Interior admissions while assembling the map feel earned, not tidy epiphany. The final “bloom” tracks to established traits, though the relationship pressure is brief rather than crucible‑transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the color of wonder before her winter muteness—drives every choice, from tuning to embedding the ice. Interiority is concrete in tactile acts (tensioning for C-sharp, the prayer-like adjustments). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than live-on-the-page; urgency vs. calm craft seldom sparks true friction. Still, the final renunciation (accepting silence) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s desire to save the roses while quieting his “inner static” is clear, embodied, and escalates convincingly under crisis. The android “flaw” of nostalgia becomes a motivating contradiction that drives a risky, inventive choice. Micro‑choices (opening the box, channeling the storm, choosing the vent) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The resolution—sacrificing the dome/farm-in-place for a seedlike remnant—feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to listen and heal—drives clean, aligned actions (pocketing the locket, convening neighbors, unlocking the box). Interiority is present but safe; little contradictory impulse or visible personal cost under pressure. Secondary characters offer distinct, efficient impressions without real counterpressure. The final renunciation/endurance cost is mostly communal and emotional rather than personally risky.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—save Aegis and “encrypt vulnerability as strength”—is specific and drives concrete choices (recovering entries, rolling dice, choosing dance over panic). Interiority is embodied (cold water at her knees, steady breath), showing fear coexisting with resolve. The decisive endurance at the end (not running immediately, ritual care with dice) feels earned. A touch more visible internal contradiction in the peak beat could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s motive—recovering erased memories—drives clear, coherent choices (grounds-reading, digging, the flower ritual). Interiority is specific (bone‑tug, brine sting, brittle flowers) and avoids therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is limited; he doesn’t truly wrestle with reclaiming vs releasing until the end. The final acceptance lands as earned, though the emotional price registers more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent—hush the coded prophecy—and her micro‑choices (mapping silence, placing and dipping the wing, pushing harder) align with that aim. Embodied stress is present (sweat, steady fingers, breath work), though inner contradiction is minimal; she reads more as composed practitioner than conflicted person. The cost lands as endurance and the loss of the tool rather than a deep personal rupture. Strong, focused, but short on layered ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive—to extract meaning from buildings—reads clear and specific, with embodied grief grounded in tactile beats (seal, tea, mortar lines). Her internal conflict (interrogation vs. acceptance) is dramatized through Mrs. Thorne’s pressure and the letter. The shift to honoring the “agreed upon lie” is motivated by prior history and the present exchange. Slight neatness in the epiphany cadence keeps it just shy of transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, coherent motivation and steady agency under pressure; her micro-choices (adjusting stones, recalibrating the lapis orb) align with her goal. Embodied emotion lands (tears, trembling) without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is modest—resolve overrides doubt—so the arc feels slightly tidy. The cost of reliving the memory reads, but she never risks failing beyond the ritual’s precision.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—family legacy, guilt over an ancestor’s coerced crime, and a principled mission to “calibrate” treason. Interiority is embodied (powdered lapis on fingers, breath misting, trembling hand) and conflict is specific: too much vs. too little correction. The micro‑choices around pressure and restraint (a “moth’s wingbeat” of force) reveal values under stress. Slight idealization of competence keeps contradiction modest but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaela’s desire to protect the truth and learn why “some people echo” is clear and consistent, and her embodied perceptions (rock vibrations, shell hum) ground her interiority. The fear/resolve tension is credible, especially when Renn warns and she chooses to sing anyway. The relationship functions as pressure, not comfort, sharpening her choice. The final commitment reads earned with a visible risk cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—salvaging something pure—is clear and consistently embodied in action and perception. Her interiority is specific (the dream parsing, the tactile handling of the globe) and avoids stock emotion; the tears freezing at realization land. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; the piece could sharpen the push‑pull between truth‑seeking and the cost of exposure. The final renunciation (rescuing a memory over material salvage) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kenji’s motive—reverent attention to hidden effort—is consistent and embodied in small, specific choices (placing the whisk, whistling, brewing tea as ritual). Interiority is particular to his craft, linking net knots to the parapet’s “loom.” Internal contradiction is minimal; he faces little resistance beyond uncertainty, so pressure on his values is gentle. The closing endurance (sitting long after the tea cools) is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motive—debunking “comfortable lies”—is clear and coherently drives each action (entering the storm, dismissing the curse, digging, reassembling). Interiority is specific enough (her skepticism vs. locals’ superstition), though contradictions under pressure are mild. The final renunciation—replacing the diamond and leaving with the letters—reads earned with a conceptual cost rather than a visceral one. A touch more on-the-page ambivalence under pressure would deepen her humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and urgent, and her renunciation of the Prophet’s false dawn provides a credible internal turn. Interiority is embodied (“frozen finger,” “heart hammered”), and her micro-choices under pressure (tuning past chatter, rerouting power) align with her aims. The contradictory impulse—prior belief versus new conviction—registers, though the pivot happens quickly with limited on‑page friction. The cost of belief-shift is more conceptual than felt, slightly softening depth.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motive—to bridge generations—threads through specific actions (winding the corroded key, offering the lullaby silently, bottling the child’s hum). Interiority is concrete (cold-seeped bones, jars of captured sounds) and particular to him. The change is an earned reframing from archiving to communion, with the felt cost of continued solitude accepted. A touch more simultaneous contradiction under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, urgent motivation and embodied interiority (“ache in his molars,” “azure coat flapping”) ground him as a competent, “logically emotional” engineer. Micro‑choices under pressure (humming, fractional adjustments) reveal values and resolve. Internal contradiction is light—he rarely wavers—so the arc skews endurance over moral complication. Cost lands as exhaustion and strain rather than a deeper renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to cultivate patience against communal impatience—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (hand on stone, tracing the moon’s arc, leading the chant). Her internal tension between urgency and restraint reads on the page without therapy‑speak. The youth with the hammer presses her stance credibly. The visible cost is a renunciation of force rather than a bruising personal loss, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—refusing to rubber‑stamp another “accident” under a coercive boss—drives observation and choice, and the heritage lantern personalizes her resolve. Interiority is concrete (scuff pattern reading; tactile grip on the wall/lantern) with credible tension between fear/compliance and integrity/action. The final stance shift feels earned. A slight convenience in instantly tying a partial footprint to the supervisor trims depth but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Father Michael’s motive (honor Elias’s last request while wrestling with guilt) is clear and intensifies through micro‑choices: seeking a second opinion, staying through the delicate repair, and deciding to drive through the night. Interiority is concrete and embodied (hands that “learned patience,” holding breath), with a credible contradiction of hope vs. self‑reproach. Mrs. Gable exerts useful, characterful pressure without stealing focus. The closing acceptance of “he deserves peace too” feels earned by prior beats rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zephyr’s motivation is clear and specific, and their embodied persistence (acid scars, workshop losses) grounds the goal. The internal pivot—recognizing the missing “unspoken hope”—lands as earned rather than convenient after twenty years and multiple attempts. Micro‑choices (launching despite a hissing beam, switching from calculation to felt resonance) reveal values under pressure. The epiphany is swift but supported by long pursuit and the kaleidoscope’s prior groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is crystal clear and intensifies under pressure; her lies and the last‑second launch of the script align with motive. Interiority is lean but specific (patch, pulse, “heart pounded”), though internal contradiction is modest beyond duty vs. obsession. Vance functions as immediate pressure with legible status dynamics. The final stance shift—rescue over search—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motive (prevent violence by “mapping empathy onto action”) is consistent and enacted through concrete choices (seeking the mirrors, assembling shards, confronting Kael). Interiority is present via shadow‑embodied sensation but contradictory impulses are light; Silas reads highly competent with minimal on‑page doubt or cost. Kael’s brief on‑page presence adds social pressure but doesn’t deepen a relationship crucible. The closing stance feels earned though somewhat low‑friction for Silas emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives—post‑euthanasia clarity redirected into learning “the sound of approaching endings”—are specific, embodied, and drive her micro‑choices (volunteering, trawling, handling the parasol tip). Contradictory impulses (end/understand endings; patience/fold in patience) operate simultaneously in scene. The near‑crack and talisman choice reveal character under pressure without therapy‑speak. The change to an earned stance (listening within endings) forecloses the prior self‑erasure path with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (grain under her fingers, gravel biting her knees), and her ache is character‑particular. Her micro‑choices—picking up the letter, reinterpreting it, deciding to keep it as a “seed”—align with a quiet, watchful temperament. The final stance (keeping the letter to cultivate understanding) reads as an earned renunciation/acceptance. A minor ding: “to nurture intersubjective understanding” edges into abstract label‑speak not wholly organic to her voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent—preserving the prophet’s first truths—and her micro‑choices (kneeling, aligning breath, whispering “Hold”) reveal competence under pressure. The “strangely honest” burden adds texture, though internal contradiction is light and mostly stated rather than dramatized. Her cost appears as exhaustion and the risk of weaving her being into the clearing, but the sacrifice remains understated. Strong single‑POV embodiment without a deep fracture or risky failure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and embodied in specific choices (curating the path, giving her own grief‑photo to Leo), with steady, character‑particular perception. Internal tension is understated but present—the calm curator carrying a private hollow. Secondary characters add texture without pressuring her into a decisive confrontation. A hair of abstraction (“transmute suffering into a masterpiece”) dulls the otherwise concrete interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—proving language is living—drives concrete micro‑choices (placing the crystal, abandoning linear notes, leaning in to listen, catching the shard). Interiority is specific and embodied (ink‑stained fingers, blood’s rush, rustling “verdant”). Internal contradiction (trust in books vs. their obsolescence) is present but lightly dramatized. The end registers an earned stance shift toward fragile hope with modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s motive—to capture the sound of aging—drives each micro‑choice (chalk spirals, driftwood arrows, sprinting to the plink) and is complicated by his precognitive amnesia. Interiority is embodied and particular (“vibrated in his molars,” “weight of his own life”). The contradiction—urgent longing vs. inevitable forgetting—stays live in scene and culminates in a costly endurance. The final renunciation-by-impairment (standing empty-handed) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aris’s grief-driven motive is clear and particular, with concrete embodiment in the clock, the tremors, and his hands on optics. The contradictory impulses—control vs. acceptance—play out credibly in the pivot from resisting tremors to harmonizing with them. The epiphany risks neatness but feels earned by the precise, fragile “leaf tick” trigger. Final acceptance forecloses the prior path of brute stabilization with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and agency are clear and consequential: she insists on the rooftop, orchestrates sound, and deploys the vinyl shard. Interiority is embodied through sensory focus and occupational tact, though her serenity borders on idealized with limited visible internal contradiction. Aris functions more as a recipient than an active foil, appropriate for the moment but limiting relational dynamism. The final “benediction” and her steady holding of space earn the renunciatory closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑particular, and her micro‑choices (rune corrections, calibrated tension with the key) align with her quietly deliberate nature. Interiority emerges through tactile focus rather than label‑speak. The cost—accepting she hasn’t found Varn—registers with restraint. A deeper on‑page contradiction (impulse toward risk vs. caution) could have sharpened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and concrete, with a clear flaw (arrogant skepticism) evolving into a principled, grace‑tempered stance. The decisive micro‑choice—repurposing the tooth and committing to teach the village children—aligns with her motivation. However, internal contradiction is largely resolved before the scene, so pressure in the moment is modest. Finn’s presence warms but doesn’t substantively test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—supplying flameless light under fire risk and honoring her grandmother—rooted in embodied acts (weighing, polishing). The internal contradiction (earthbound loss vs. found purpose) is present without melodrama. Micro‑choices (selecting the “pearl of stillness” shard, committing to the village display) reveal values. The cost—renouncing the dream of orbiting observatories—registers, though its sting is mostly recollected rather than acutely contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular: to reframe shame into connection, dramatized through the micro‑choice to reveal the pendant. Contradictory impulses (seeking refuge vs. risking exposure) are present and resolved via a credible, earned offering. Embodied perception (moss, icicle patterns) grounds her interiority without therapy‑speak. The relationship with Mara functions as a crucible that tests and affirms the new stance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—hoarding hopes to force an ending—collides with his fear of erasure, producing credible micro‑choices (kneeling, tracing, forcing the shell, then releasing). Embodied cues (salt mist, trembling hands, the shell’s hum) keep his interiority specific. The contradiction—collector vs witness—operates in scene, not summary. The renunciation at the end reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive to restore sacred practices is clear, embodied in tactile choices (tendril insertion, hymn-singing, using her grandfather’s token). Interiority is specific (panic, rough voice, calloused fingers) but largely unconflicted; she moves from problem to solution without much contradictory impulse. The micro‑choice under pressure—grabbing the stone and risking the device—reveals values and lineage. Cost is mostly emotional and memory‑bound rather than a visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief-fueled purpose is clear and embodied in slow, precise action; the counted breaths and frost-stiff fingers ground motive in behavior. Contradictory impulses are subtler—caution vs. urgency under the eclipse—but they’re present. Her micro-choices (arranging spirals, choosing totality to act, sealing with “wax of frozen tears”) credibly reveal values. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with emotional cost tied to Lina.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is specific and propels concrete, expert choices under time pressure. Embodied grief coexists with disciplined method, though internal contradiction remains modest (she stays largely unruffled). Micro-choices (millimeter tilts, watching reflections not prisms) reveal a precise hierarchy of values. The ending’s endurance choice (keep wonder, not Silas) lands with a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is concrete and enacted through micro-choices (lamp orientation, wrist rotation), and her burden-logic feels character-specific. The “fractal weaver’s curse” deepens interior conflict without feeling like label-speak. The faint smile at the end reads as earned endurance/renunciation with cost. A touch more contradiction under peak stress could elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is unambiguous and embodied through tactile choices (tracing grain, taking the first cut), with grief contradictions (here/gone) present in action. The widow’s micro‑choices under a live clock feel credible and character‑specific. A slightly over-tidy epiphany line (“she had harvested this truth…”) trims ambiguity and softens the cost. Still, endurance-as-choice lands with felt specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—gather 100 sorrow‑fragments to negotiate with her own ghost—is specific, persistent, and drives every choice. Interiority is embodied (“cold wire” of regret; the crunch of glassy silt), with credible contradiction between resolve and erosion. The final renunciation—offering the fragments as apology and accepting silence—reads as an Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor limitation: “chronologically confused” appears more as texture than a live constraint on her peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and competence are clear and embodied through tactile choices (grease-stained fingers, rerouting power). Her interiority is specific—stoic wonder rather than gush—but internal contradiction is light; she seldom struggles beyond dust and risk. The sextant insight credibly reveals character under pressure. The final stance—returning with colleagues—feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (ritual with satchel, tactile precision), and contradictory impulses are present: craft‑bound caution versus the pull toward abandoned creation. The silent encounter with the bear reveals his perfectionism’s cost without sermonizing, and his micro‑choices (lowering the oiler, holding still) align with character. The renunciation at the end reads earned by prior pressure. A faint neatness to the epiphany keeps it short of sublime.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the sundial grounds her interiority. The shift from legend‑chasing to dismantling fraud is credible and earned by her training and discovery. However, internal conflict is relatively frictionless; the epiphany arrives cleanly with limited on‑page resistance. Emotional cost is implied more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—preserving ancient methods—drives every micro‑choice on the dock, and his patience is enacted in tactile, character‑specific ways (gloves, breath, fulgurite). Interiority is grounded in objects and action rather than labels, with an earned quiet elation at discovery. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece leans on steadfastness over competing impulses. The final vow (tying the rope to the tin) reads as a credible endurance choice with a subtle cost in time and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—mapping absences to enable healing—is precise and embodied through tactile ritual with the thread. Her interiority is concrete and character‑specific (saffron scent, sea‑spray phantom) with a credible burden/sacrament tension. Micro‑choices (summoning Varek, revising the obituary, shifting to “pattern”) reveal values under pressure. The endurance cost is felt via her own grief (Silas) without tidy self‑absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s drive—to reawaken beauty—organizes every choice from theft of moss to calibrating coils, and his final refusal to “fix” the hatchling is an earned renunciation. Interiority is textured and embodied (oil‑stained hands, ozone/moss taste), with credible fear braided into awe. The contradiction (perfectionist impulse vs. acceptance of fracture) is dramatized by the imperfect chick. Minor hedge: the prince’s inner counter‑arguments remain largely lyric rather than contested by a second pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—atonement through healing the land—reads cleanly and her embodied actions (grafting, mixing black sand, touching the coin) align with that drive. The internal contradiction (shame and anger toward her father vs. devotion to the damaged place) is present but rarely forces a hard on‑page tradeoff. Still, the micro‑choices under quiet pressure feel character‑particular and consistent with a firefighter’s discipline. The final renunciation of guilt into service lands as earned endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (liberate the city’s memories) is consistent, embodied, and scaled by the seventeen‑year wait; the trembling hands and tear tracks register cost. The skeptic‑who‑believes tension is credible, though internal contradiction under peak pressure could be sharper. Micro‑choices (following the wire, reading breadcrumbs, pouring drop by drop) reveal a value hierarchy (patience over force). The endurance and renunciation of the starlight resource earns the final hope.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she must disperse seeds “without using fire”—and her lineage charges her choices. Interiority is particular (tears crystallizing, ache for cycles she can’t halt), though contradictions are mild (grief vs. resolve rather than a sharper clash). Micro‑choices (slotting the gear, adjusting tactics as density changes, releasing seeds) align with motives. The earned endurance at the end reads credible, with an emotional cost held rather than solved.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s motive—to transmute solitary grief into a collective vessel—is clear and enacted through embodied, trade‑off laden choices (ribbons tied at charged sites). The gravestone carver’s worldview (stone vs “space between”) generates a credible inner conflict reframed by Corvin. He pays a visible cost (first tears since the funeral) that forecloses the old stance. Minor note: the mentor’s guidance edges toward neatness, but the change still reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation (restore the clock/town to atone for Silas) is clear and drives concrete, pressured micro‑choices (timing the chisel at the pendulum’s infinitesimal stillness). Interiority is character‑particular—craft knowledge braided with grief. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. self‑recrimination) play simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of pure penance into promise reads earned, if a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motives and temperament are clear and embodied through tools and ritual, and her micro‑choices (lens, tweezers, smoothing the edge) align with her “tenderly organized” nature. The internal turn from blithe to solemn registers, but there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; her competence faces minimal resistance. The cost at closure is mostly the burden of remembrance, felt but light.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is clear and specific—seed innovation within ice’s constraint—and the risks are concretely acknowledged (“flood villages or deepen the freeze”). Interiority is textured with tactile anchors (frost tracing, breath fog, quill weight). The internal conflict is present but mostly conceptual; he rarely wavers, so contradictory impulses don’t fully combust on the page. The final stance feels earned, though relatively low on messy ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is precise and character‑particular: a former orchestra copyist repurposing her craft to restore stories. Micro‑choices—tuning, transcribing fragments, deciding to “cloak” dust—align with that motive. Interiority is embodied and specific (radio warmth, trembling ink), though internal contradiction is minimal; fear of authorities is noted rather than dramatized in conflict. The final endurance/stance—quiet restoration over open rebellion—reads earned but lightly priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—crystallizing fleeting emotion through ritual—drives every choice, culminating in a credible renunciation at closure. The internal tension between preserving and accepting dissolution is embodied (mask weight, final scattering). Micro‑choices (spiral pattern, leaving the pouch) reveal value hierarchy without safety‑hedging. A faint tendency to declare motive (“rebellion against oblivion”) trims the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Phil’s motive—to preserve rational methods—drives every micro‑choice, and his abrasive calm under Kael’s taunts rings true. Status dynamics are clear as Kael kicks silt and Phil counters with evidence. However, Phil lacks a live internal contradiction; he is unwavering, which trims depth. The endurance choice at the end is earned but pays a modest on‑page cost (social isolation, threatened labor).

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ms. Thorne’s motive—to repair a fractured choir through listening—is clear and consistent, with tactile interiority (pearwood filigree, beeswax air) grounding her choices. The “expectantly resigned” stance credibly coexists with active pedagogy, creating a modest but real internal contradiction. Mateo and Aisha are glimpsed with just enough specificity to register pressure and empathy without stealing POV. A slight didactic tint in articulated insights keeps the emotional complexity just shy of profound ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, particular interiority and tactile choices (pruning deeper, salvaging the seed, keeping vigil) reveal a stubborn, tender resolve. The tasting of memories embodies emotion without therapy‑speak and informs micro‑choices. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—pain/ache versus persistence—rather than a sharp split. A few thesis-like lines (“gentle rebellion”) tell what the images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific (the truth compulsion as embodied pressure) and her micro‑choices under stress (choosing to reveal everything, including the riddle) align with motive and cost. The compulsion meaningfully complicates her interaction with the man, revealing character through action. A slight neatness at the end tilts toward tidy reassurance, shaving edge from her internal conflict. Overall, she reads particular and credible within the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to test why some houses feel alive—is specific and steady, and her embodied perceptions (boots crunching, the orris shard warming) ground her interiority. Agency escalates from small trials to the Finnegan place and culminates in tears and acceptance. Internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers or pays a concrete price beyond vulnerable hope. Still, micro‑choices with the objects reveal a distinct hierarchy of values and a credible, earned softening at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aelius’s motives are clear and specific, and his shift from rigid blame to sorrowing nuance feels earned via the ampoule’s staged revelations. Interiority is embodied (stone joints, anchoring against current) and tied to micro‑choices. Internal conflict resolves swiftly and cleanly, with minimal mess or resistance at the peak. The cost is largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motive—capturing the “texture” of a missed choice—drives concrete actions (testing the theorem, placing the chipped die) and culminates in a credible renunciation. His internal contradiction (escape vs. re‑inhabiting hesitation) is dramatized at the rupture and paid with cost. Embodied details (grain of wood, rain scent, die’s fracture) ground his abstract aim. Minor on‑the‑nose maxims (“perfection traps…”) slightly flatten nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motive (preserving lost languages to awaken kindness) is vivid and consistent, with embodied doubt versus “methodical hope” driving on‑page choices. Micro‑choices—ritualizing under moonlight, posting the canvas, waiting anonymously—reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The grandmother tie personalizes the stakes without sentimentality. Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle, keeping the conflict intimate rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s scholarly urgency and embodied fear are clear, and her micro‑choice to repurpose ritual baskets feels motivated by long‑standing preservation instincts. Internal contradiction is light—she pivots decisively rather than wrestling on the page—but the tension between ritual reverence and pragmatic salvage reads. Secondary characters (elders, Varen) supply ambient pressure rather than active opposition. The final stance—choosing survival over purity—lands with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to step beyond fate’s design—is clear and sustained, and her actions align with it throughout. We get tactile interiority (oil-stained fingers, cold resolve) and competence without grandstanding. However, contradiction under pressure is minimal: she rarely hesitates or pays an on‑page emotional price beyond the final “terrifyingly unwritten” note. The change feels more conceptual than psychologically contested, slightly limiting depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s motives and interiority are clear and embodied from the first line—tender ribs, copper taste, and a history with a “photographic” curse drive concrete choices. Contradictory impulses surface credibly: revulsion versus attraction to the “repulsive allure,” fear versus the will to expose it. Her micro-choices (photographing the clasp, then herself) align with the paradox method and show growth. The closing stance—embracing the curse to unmask fear—lands, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vow-driven motive is clear and consistently enacted under pressure, and her micro-choices (jamming the mallet into the breach, reading clouds to shift tempo) align with character. Interiority is tactile (salt stinging, mallet against chest) but leans more toward competence than contradiction. The piece would benefit from a sharper internal counter-impulse or cost to deepen complexity. Still, her endurance and craft-centered agency feel specific and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motive—understanding the watchers via the city’s “language”—is precise and embodied, with tactile habits (chalk, ochre, stylus) revealing character under pressure. The “quietly driven” trait coheres with his patience and risk tolerance, culminating in a credible resolve to go. Internal contradiction is modest (curiosity vs dread) rather than actively colliding in‑scene. Still, actions align cleanly with motives, and the last choice feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her “emotionally rational” calibration is embodied in small actions (timed by the last petal, calmly gathering papers, committing to present). Internal contradiction is mild—sorrow vs. resolve—without a truly pressured fracture, but the Clara memory adds moral tension. Her final choice (to confront the council) is earned by prior causality with a visible social cost. The piece avoids stock therapy‑speak and shows character through tactile engagement with objects and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are concrete and consistent, and her embodied choices (wresting the cornerstone, deciding to embed notes and return the originals) reveal a clear value hierarchy. The “stoically sensitive” contradiction is dramatized rather than labeled, with strain against the sea offset by tenderness toward memory. Internal conflict is subtle rather than combative, but the final renunciation—leaving the watercolors sealed—lands as an earned cost. Character reads particular through tool-use, attention to sound/texture, and inherited purpose via the inkwell.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive to “trace honest origins” is clear and her choices (gathering stamp-marked documents, carving a provisional mark) align tightly with that motive. Interiority is concrete and embodied (cool brass in hand, stiff posture, chill unrelated to damp), showing a practiced, meticulous mind. Internal contradiction is mild—doubt versus duty—so the emotional price reads more conceptual than felt. Still, the steady renunciation of the official chronology is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is crystal: transmute grief by craft, with credible contradictory impulses (“descends while ascending”) embodied in action. Micro‑choices under pressure—continuing to polish through pain, choosing lantern over crane—reveal values with cost. Interiority is concrete (plum blossom scent, knuckles white) and character‑particular. Minor ding for one slightly declarative insight line, but the choice still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aris’s grief-driven rigor and the contradictory surge of hope are embodied in concrete micro‑choices (placing the geode, rerunning sequences, logging coordinates). The interiority feels specific and physical (rail bite, hum through deck), avoiding stock therapy‑speak. Final stance (map pools, not reclaim the past) is earned and costs him the fantasy of reversal. Minor melodramatic edges don’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—chasing a “frequency of belonging”—is specific, embodied, and coherently tied to her competence and wartime loss. The trembling at the decisive moment (“Now!”) credibly contradicts her steady pilot’s hands, earning the turn. Micro‑choices (waiting for convergence, aligning chip) reveal values under pressure. The only softness is a near‑tidy emotional landing that minimizes lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motive is clear and particular—atonement through truth—and his internal conflict (professional self‑justification versus belated accountability) breaks on the watch‑hand reveal. Embodied emotion lands (“sharp edge biting into his skin”) and aligns with action. The ending renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Slight convenience in his retroactive “remembering” tempers peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motive—translating past failure into present mercy—is clear and drives the final choice, with the drawer pull concretizing his guilt and resolve. Interiority is embodied through tactile detail (cold brass, slick stone) rather than label-speak. The contradictory impulses—protocol/pride vs. release—are credible and present in-scene. A minor ding: some history is told rather than dramatized, softening the live struggle slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses—drawn to open water yet forcing himself shoreward—play out in embodied choices (humming through tears, counting poles, dropping the compass, beached with phone in hand). Specific memories (missed graduation, first crab) sharpen motive and cost. A slight overuse of explicit labels (“align heart and action,” repeated “merrily melancholic”) trims the edge of subtlety but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motives and contradictions are concrete—he wants freedom yet chooses the slower, riskier path and relinquishes his only relic to awaken empathy in another. Micro‑choices (left vs. right; give the ball or not; lift the girl) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotions are embodied (burning lungs, ache behind the eyes) rather than labeled. Minor overtness in setup (“proving he could make selfless decisions”) softens the edge but doesn’t undercut the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to reforge a bond beyond death—is precise and endures pressure, shaping concrete choices (seeking spices, choosing to conjure bond not body). Interiority is embodied and specific (bark under her fingers, spice scents as memory). The contradiction between refusal to accept loss and acceptance of metamorphosis plays on the page. The ending’s renunciation reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motive is precise and embodied, with tactile anchors (the cracked saucer, the tablecloth) guiding credible choices. The surrender to “willing perplexity” coheres with her cartomancer identity and culminates in a paid cost. Internal contradiction is present but gentle—more devotion than friction—so the arc lacks a sharper tug-of-war. Still, the final renunciation (pouring the vial) reads earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s pacifism, survivor’s guilt, and fear of being last create credible contradictory impulses that she works through in scene. Her micro‑choices—selecting her mother’s photo, forgiving herself, and embracing the part that “craved oblivion”—motivate the climax. Emotions are embodied (hair drifting in zero‑G, tears, tactile tools) rather than labeled. The final change reads earned, with a felt cost in the ship’s new emptiness and her acceptance that “her time was near.”

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motives are clear and particular (fetch seawater for a sick child; live his creed of generosity; seek the “texture of transformation”). Interiority is embodied through tactile sand, glass, and wing-buzz details, but he skews saintly, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Key micro-choices (detouring to the beach, gathering shards after the bottle breaks) align with character. The arc to embracing destitution feels earned, though costs are gentle and conflict rarely bites back.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—ignite a silent revolution under cover of the blackout—is clear and drives her choices. Competence and calm inventiveness are embodied in the quill‑holder alignment, though internal contradiction is limited. The heritage object adds particularity to her inner life without yielding substantial ambivalence. The final commitment to “melt back into the shadows” reads earned, with implied cost but little on‑page fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive (fulfilling Mara’s promise by decoding sacred patterns) is clear and compels concrete micro-choices under pressure. His contradictory impulses—control via math vs surrender to vision—play out in the moment the stone slides and he abandons sequence. Embodied stress (slick rocks, sweat freezing, trembling from visions) grounds interiority. The renunciation at the end feels earned and carries cost (accepting ephemerality over mastery).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motives and interiority are vivid and embodied through tools (the timer), scars, and the ritual of counting; his exile and Elara’s note drive credible micro‑choices. The contradiction—furious tranquility amidst tempest—shows in action, not label alone. The epiphany edges tidy, but it’s earned via on‑page patterning and cost (relinquishing the external event for an internal conjunction). Emotional texture remains character‑particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motives (broker peace, decode the message, survive) are clear and embodied through the weight and function of his mechanical arm and his tactical patience under pressure. His micro‑choices during the duel—using footwork to align with the sundial instead of seeking a killing blow—reveal hierarchy of values. Vorlag is more one‑note, but the status dynamics are legible. The final renunciation (deflecting rather than striking) feels earned, though the on‑page cost remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, character-particular interiority with credible contradiction between the timid Scribe and the bold Architect drives the on-page choice. The coffee tin and tactile actions ground motive. The cost is felt but somewhat idealized; pressure never forces a messy mistake or visible stumble. Lack of a live counterforce in-scene limits crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to intervene and reach Leo before night—drives concrete micro‑choices (mimicking the clock’s pulse with music, choosing the arbor to mask her presence). Interiority is embodied through tactile detail (cracked ivory, the hum of the broken spring) rather than labels. A mild gap is the limited on‑page contradiction; despair versus agency is stated more than dramatized, though her pivot to music shows credible resolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s drive to safeguard collective memory is clear and embodied in concrete micro‑choices (measuring pitch, selecting Lyra, placing the seed). Her “empirically whimsical” doubt provides a credible internal tension without devolving into labels. The quickness of success after identifying the key slightly reduces felt struggle and cost. Still, interiority and action align and culminate in a believable, earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in flaw: pride withheld a warning; now regret fuels a deliberate attempt to mend. Interiority is concrete and embodied through pruning, stitching, and handling the compass and lace. Contradictory impulses—defensiveness versus accountability—surface and resolve into an earned renunciation. The final choice (weaving new instructions, a daily tending) feels like genuine cost rather than neat absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb. Aris's motivation is established with nuance, rooting her professional burnout in a specific intellectual conflict: the demand for "explosive narratives" versus the "quiet truth of gradual transformation." Her internal conflict is not just stated but dramatized through her micro-choices, like shifting her focus from a beautiful, singular relic (the butterfly wing) to the mundane, collective pattern of dust. The final change is earned, a crystallization of her core traits under the pressure of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her core trait ("steadily adaptive") is demonstrated effectively through her actions. The link between her artistic skills and tracking ability is a notable strength. However, the score is capped by interiority that occasionally slips into overly articulated, diagnostic language for a character in crisis, such as the explicit goal "to discover purpose in the pauses," which reads more like a thematic summary than an authentic internal driver.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a profound loss that makes her quest to "translate silence into music" feel urgent and necessary. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied details—"Frustration tightened her throat"—that avoid cliché. The final change from desperate innovator to fulfilled composer is earned through a specific, character-driven breakthrough, fulfilling the narrative arc with a palpable sense of cost and rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is exceptionally clear and well-rooted in his established profession and temperament. The internal conflict between his weariness and his stubborn sense of duty is palpable and drives the narrative without overt summary. The final choice to defer his own rest feels inevitable and earned, a perfect culmination of his character as someone who gives "rest a permanent address," now for the unburied as well as the buried.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in an earned emotional shift. The direct statement of his motivation ("His motivation—to build intergenerational support—was etched...") is a minor weakness, slightly telling what the rest of the scene shows effectively. However, his interiority is embodied, and his final choice to ring the bell feels like a credible culmination of his gently persistent nature, satisfying the core character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and rooted in a compelling backstory of spiritual failure. Interiority is well-embodied, particularly the physical trembling and the visceral recollection. The final change is earned; however, the internal experience occasionally drifts toward thematic summary, as in "a pilgrim of sparks...driven by a spiritually curious ache," which feels more like an authorial label than a character's raw internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is potent and clear, rooted in both intellectual curiosity ("discover the texture of time") and profound personal loss. His interiority is conveyed through embodied emotion ("heart hammered a rhythm") rather than labels. The final earned realization provides a devastating arc, transforming his initial motive into the story's central tragedy, fulfilling the 9+ gate with a choice that has a deeply felt, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained under pressure. Her interiority, particularly the line "patience was her shield against panic," is concrete and demonstrated through steady action amidst chaos. The final act of self-sacrifice feels earned and consistent with the established motive of prioritizing the land's future over her own liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is singular and powerfully rendered, directly fueling her every action from forging metal to filtering sound. Interiority is exceptional, blending technical obsession with the "splinter in her soul" from a past betrayal. The final emotional reaction—less victory than a confirmation of loss—is a sophisticated and earned change, demonstrating a character arc that is both subtle and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and drives a clear internal arc from seeking a person to discovering herself. Her competence is well-established through specific skills (e.g., thermal expansion). However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "luminous disbelief" rather than fully embodying the emotion, and a few moments of self-awareness feel slightly too articulated for a character mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between grief and creative purpose is well-established. The "thoughtfully spirited" narration is a unique and effective character trait, showing his coping mechanism. However, interiority sometimes slips into diagnostic language, such as "embodying weighty lightness," which reads more like an authorial summary than an in-the-moment feeling, slightly undermining the otherwise strong embodiment of his emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority occasionally lapses into overly articulated self-awareness. Phrases like "vulnerability felt like a raw nerve—and her only weapon" and the final paragraph's neat summary of her change read more like thematic statements than embodied emotion. While her core struggle is compelling, this diagnostic self-awareness slightly flattens the rawness of her crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and her interiority is rendered with exceptional, concrete detail. The characterization is strong, showing a mind uniquely suited to its task. It stops just short of the 9-band because her defining "obsession" is more asserted than dramatized through a contradictory impulse; her focus remains almost unwaveringly pure throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is singular and powerfully clear, driving the narrative forward. However, the interiority relies on the repeated label "remarkably composed" rather than fully embodying a struggle against non-composure, which slightly flattens the internal conflict. The final change in perspective toward janitorial duties is earned and provides a satisfying arc, but the emotional state feels more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation shifts credibly from solitary curiosity to a feeling of complicity, compelling her final action. The internal change is earned, though the leap to feeling "complicity" is quite rapid. The musicians' conflict is efficiently sketched, and Elara's final choice to break her silence carries a felt, on-page cost of social vulnerability ("her cheeks warm"), making her transformation from observer to participant legible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is profound and perfectly embodied in her ritual with the flawed marbles, creating a powerful internal contradiction between her acceptance of imperfection and her defiance of the system. The connection between her "knotted fingers" and the "withered vines" is established early and carried through to the end, making her physical state a mirror of the garden she tends. The final choice to place the marble is not a grand victory but a quiet act of faith, earned by decades of patience, foreclosing any path of surrender to the Quantifiers' logic with the cost of her long, isolated struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and potent, effectively driving the single, focused action of the narrative. Her interiority is well-embodied, particularly the trembling hands and the final vindication. However, the central internal conflict between her "obliging" nature and her rebellious ambition is presented as backstory rather than a dynamic, in-scene struggle, which slightly lessens the tension of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the action from start to finish. However, Elias functions more as a lens for the plot than a complex individual; he lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction. His competence in deciphering the clues feels slightly unearned for a musician, making him more of a necessary instrument for the narrative's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The motivation to quantify guilt is specific and rooted in her professional identity, driving the story's central action. The internal contradiction between her need for precision and the messy reality of grief is dramatized beautifully through her interaction with the illustration, culminating in an earned, character-specific epiphany. The final choice to embrace the "smudge" demonstrates a meaningful change with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Leo’s transformation from “religiously skeptical” to a “keeper of the swallowed truth” provides a clear arc. However, the shift is catalyzed almost entirely by the external coincidence of the radio call, making his change feel more reactive than earned. The interiority shows the result of the change but doesn't fully dramatize the struggle of his skepticism crumbling; he accepts the supernatural connection very quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling internal conflict between her vow (witness) and her instinct (act). This contradiction is not merely stated but dramatized effectively during the crisis. Her motivation is the engine of the plot, and the final choice—a renunciation of action in favor of a deeper form of witnessing—is a potent and earned resolution to her internal struggle, fulfilling the 9+ test for a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in a well-integrated backstory with her grandmother, which grounds her actions. However, the character’s interiority occasionally slips into over-articulated, diagnostic language (e.g., describing her own resilience as "softly adaptive"). The mirroring of "cautiously exuberant" in both her own approach and Leo's final state feels a bit too tidy, slightly undermining the earned, messy nature of emotional change.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, fitting the story's length and focus. The characterization is competent, but lacks the internal conflict or contradictory impulses needed for the highest tier; her function as a dispassionate archivist is consistent but limits deep emotional engagement. Her 'change' is a logical deepening of her mission rather than a difficult, costly choice, which feels appropriate for her non-human nature but less dramatically compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her competence under pressure is well-dramatized in the climax. The character arc from passive keeper to active "orchestrator" is satisfying. However, the interiority feels slightly generic; "Panic surged" is a label that isn't fully embodied in her perception or actions, which remain almost superhumanly precise, slightly flattening the emotional stakes of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Anselm’s motivation is powerfully clear and his actions are driven by a specific, professional competence that is tested and adapted under pressure. The interiority is sharp and concise, especially the pivot point: "Muffled clarity settled over him; the solution was simple, terrible." This moment of realization is earned through his prior actions and effectively shifts his tactics from direct repair to indirect intervention, demonstrating a complex problem-solving process rather than a simple A-to-B path.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action. Her interiority is concrete, linking specific memories to sensory outcomes, which grounds the abstract premise. The final change from "chronologically homesick" to a state of peace is earned, though the characterization occasionally feels subordinate to the lyrical concept.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and effectively drives the plot. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through his physical interactions with his past and future selves. However, the interiority often slips into abstract, diagnostic language (e.g., "conquering the labyrinth of self," "discarding dead ends of regret") that feels more like authorial summary than a character's genuine thought process mid-crisis. This tendency undermines the emotional authenticity of his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation to overcome her numbness is clear and deeply embodied through her unique sensory world. Her agency in experimenting with the broken needle feels earned and character-particular. The introduction of Silas provides a powerful, non-verbal validation that crystallizes her internal shift, showing a change in her state of connection rather than just summarizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her meticulous, data-driven nature. The internal conflict between preserving solitude and acting on integrity is well-dramatized. However, the final beats lapse into over-articulated self-awareness ("Integrity, she realized, thrived not in isolation..."), which slightly undermines the earned interiority by stating the theme directly instead of letting the final action carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation is powerful and consistent, driving the plot from a past reckless trade to the final, earned renunciation. The interiority is concrete, though the climax brushes against diagnostic language with "synesthetic grief," slightly flattening the emotion. His final choice is a credible evolution, paying a clear cost in the "aching recognition" that makes the shift feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is compellingly dramatized. The final change from feeling time as "sediment" to a "companion" is earned through on-page action. The characterization is very strong, held back from a higher score only by a few phrases like "ethically playful curiosity" that feel slightly more like authorial labels than organic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a consistent and deeply embodied motivation to find meaning in loss. Her interiority is specific and compelling, particularly her acoustic perception which is a trait, not just a label. The final choice to play the violin is perfectly earned, emerging from her internal conflict between fear and a family-instilled need to create, making the final Resonant Reconfiguration feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's characterization is exceptional, her motivation a compelling blend of professional rigor and a deeper need for understanding. The internal conflict between her "affectionate detachment" and the drive "to fuse insight with empathy" is not merely stated but dramatized in the climax. The final choice to refine the formula is an earned, credible change, with the cost being the loss of her previously stable, detached professional model.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris's transformation from shrewd broker to empathetic advocate is swift but well-motivated by the confluence of professional habit (noticing the address), personal debt (Mateo's past help), and witnessing Elena's grief. His interiority is concrete, shifting from calculation to regret to purpose. The speed of the change pushes credibility for a "shrewd" character but lands successfully within the story's compressed, fable-like logic.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal arc—the transformation of her "luminescent ache" from wound to beacon—is well-executed. The final choice to create a communal sculpture is an earned culmination of her journey from observer to participant. The characterization is strong, though the reliance on the explicit label "luminescent ache" slightly lessens the interiority's subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her grandmother’s legacy. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly her frustration with the discordant rhythm. The final change in her perspective on her art is earned through the climactic action. However, the character's internal conflict and struggle feel slightly intellectualized; the "terror" of the method is stated but not deeply embodied in her choices or perceptions, which remain quite controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character’s motivation is exceptionally clear and tied to a compelling backstory. Interiority is sophisticated, framing emotion in a unique, intellectualized way ("mathematics of emotion"). However, Elara's internal conflict reads more as a complex problem to be solved rather than a visceral struggle between contradictory impulses, which keeps her at a slight, cerebral distance from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and undergoes a sophisticated evolution from a personal need for visibility to an altruistic act of making another visible. The visceral sense memory of her grandfather is a powerful, specific anchor for her interiority. The only minor weakness is that her motivation is articulated with a touch too much diagnostic clarity, as in "Her own motivation crystallized," which feels more like an authorial summary than an in-the-moment thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her internal conflict between scientific control and an intuitive humility is dramatized through concrete actions, not just summarized. The shift from "director" to "witness" is earned through a credible series of pressures and reflections, and the final reprisal of her "circuitously sincere" nature lands with new, peaceful weight, demonstrating a complete and satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation to “thresh meaning from experience” is clear and consistently drives her actions, from her obsessive painting to her investigation of the brooch. The shift in her internal state is earned through the story’s central revelation, culminating in the embodied resolution of sleep. The final emotional note of "haggard awe" is specific, contradictory, and perfectly captures the complex mixture of exhaustion and hope, successfully avoiding diagnostic labels in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her internal crisis upon the failure of her gift is compelling. The pilgrim functions effectively as a catalyst, though their characterization leans towards a familiar "wise guide" archetype. Elara's rapid shift from demanding answers to whispered acceptance ("Show me") feels slightly compressed, though plausible within the story's mystical logic and length constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is established clearly and evolves organically from a passive archivist ("compile fragments") to an active agent of healing ("hearten"). This change is earned through the specific, embodied visions, avoiding unearned epiphany. The final, silent scene with the fisherman powerfully demonstrates her character's impact, showing a complete and satisfying arc with a felt cost—her continued, lonely dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the plot. Elias's core conflict—the meticulous observer avoiding his own interiority—is established efficiently and paid off with a powerful, earned choice. The shift from mapping the city's grief to confronting his own is seamless. A minor weakness is the slightly diagnostic phrasing, "numbing his grief with ink and paper," which risks over-articulating the subtext, but the final action grounds this insight in embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict as a “sympathetic skeptic” is established well and provides a solid foundation for her arc. Her transformation is motivated by the supernatural vision, which is a necessary causal link. However, the speed of her shift from scoffing at the tile to acting on its revelation feels slightly compressed, and the description of her working "courageously kind" reads more like an authorial label than an embodied, contradictory internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    Aeon's motivation is primal and clear, driving the narrative with credible desperation. The transformation from cosmic boredom to renewed purpose is earned through a costly sacrifice, not a simple epiphany. The internal conflict—distrusting the amulet yet needing it—is embodied in his actions, satisfying the 9+ test of contradictory impulses culminating in a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, driven by the core internal conflict of inheriting her con-artist father's brilliance but not his "moral rot." This tension is not just stated but dramatized in her precise, mathematical approach to finding an honest solution. Her micro-choices, like tracing the ink pot's rim while seeking a formula, perfectly embody her character. The resolution feels earned, as she synthesizes both sides of her inheritance—using the cleverness of a con artist to forge a pact grounded in her own integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to "collect the textures of different times" is clear, specific, and beautifully dramatized. Her interiority is sharp and embodied, particularly in the description of the lamp's hum vibrating in her molars. The final emotional beat—tears not of sorrow but of "profound, aching connection"—is earned by the preceding scene of intense, studious focus, fulfilling the 9+ test of a costly, earned change in state.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from a philosophical need for "texture" into a concrete purpose. Elias’s interiority is rendered with specific, sensory detail ("grief felt like wet sand"), and their final choice to become an "archivist" is a well-earned renunciation that lands with palpable cost. The execution is nearly flawless, with only a minor tendency toward overly precise self-articulation of complex emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear, and the central conflict between his professional skepticism and personal grief is embodied and potent. The transformation from a "myth buster" to someone who accepts an unprovable truth is earned through his interaction with Elara's objects. The phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" is a minor slip into diagnostic labeling at a peak emotional moment, slightly abstracting the feeling rather than letting it be fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear, and his defining trait—the "dual allegiance"—is the engine of the story's central tension. His final choice to reorganize rather than fight is a perfect, earned synthesis of his contradictory impulses, demonstrating a sophisticated internal arc. The shift from his internal conflict being a burden to a source of balanced action in the final paragraphs is both credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply felt, rooted in his professional past and present melancholy. The internal conflict between his scientific precision and elegiac purpose is dramatized effectively through his methodical actions, such as setting the chemical timer while reflecting on loss. The final action—not looking back—is a powerful, earned expression of his character's renunciation, completing a concise and moving arc.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her competence is well-balanced with the painstaking nature of her work. The interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in how she perceives the world through non-visual senses. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, where the line "She hadn't just patched a machine; she'd woven intention into uncertainty..." verges on a diagnostic summary of her own arc, slightly undermining the earned, demonstrated change.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her professional mindset provides a consistent, particular lens for her interiority. The internal conflict between "worrying tranquility" and "subtle confidence" is well-established. While the struggle remains largely intellectual, her final micro-choices—sketching the pattern, stoking the stove—credibly embody her shift from uncertainty to earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, serving as the story's unwavering engine. Her actions are perfectly aligned with her goal of restoring balance. However, as a character, she functions more as a mythic archetype or catalyst than a person with complex internal contradictions; her "infinite patience" and unwavering focus leave little room for dramatized internal conflict or a visible personal cost, which keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's core motivation—survival vs. a counter-intuitive act of faith—is compelling and embodied well in the scene's central choice. The internal conflict is clear and drives the climax. However, the epiphany where Aris instantly understands the vial's precise function via "memories" feels slightly too convenient, accelerating a conceptual leap that could have been earned through more struggle or inference. The final emotional state, while earned, is articulated with a touch of diagnostic clarity that slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is powerfully established and rooted in the high-concept legacy of the "cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son." His interiority is specific and compelling, particularly the desire to escape the "suffocating echo of a voice dismissed." The final choice to embrace the silence is earned, representing a clear and meaningful change from the inherited burden of his father's noise.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly in the contradictory motivations. The ghost bride's purpose, a blend of atonement and self-destruction, is powerfully realized through the "lovingly venomous" act on the nightshade vine. Silas's shift from pained observer to active participant ("Don't.") is a crucial, if futile, micro-choice that clarifies his values. The final shared state of "mournful elation" is earned and complex, avoiding simple tragedy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are perfectly aligned with her identity as a "poetic wharf weaver." The characterization is strong and consistent, particularly in how her skills translate from mending nets to mending the community. However, her interiority, while poetic, lacks a moment of genuine contradictory impulse or doubt; her path from finding the plate to completing the project feels a bit too seamless, preventing the score from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her change from “adrift” to “rooted” is earned through her on-page actions. The characterization is strong, but the interiority occasionally leans on declarative summary (“Her motivation was clear”) rather than fully embodied perception, which slightly distances the reader from her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a believable professional ethos and personal nostalgia. His interiority is concrete, particularly the "ache for textures lost." However, the final epiphany, while emotionally resonant, feels more like an intuitive leap than a rigorously earned conclusion based on the presented evidence (a name and a street), slightly diminishing the credibility of his change.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with her internal state and external disguise creating a consistent, compelling tension. The "wisdom disguised as foolishness" trope is executed with specificity through on-page actions like dropping the thimble and fumbling the glass. The final micro-choice to stitch the candle flame provides a powerful, earned moment of character expression that solidifies her inner resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, nuanced, and psychologically sophisticated; the goal is not blame, but understanding "the fragile breath where turning back was still possible." Interiority is consistently embodied through physical sensations like the throbbing cut and aching chest, avoiding diagnostic language. The final earned change from desperate urgency to peaceful acceptance is powerful and well-supported by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Aris’s professional identity as a translator is seamlessly extended to his internal landscape, motivating his unique approach to trauma. His interiority is rendered with concrete, specific sensory details tied to his physical state (the anesthetic), avoiding generic emotional summary. The final choice to alter the symbol on the cast is a perfect culmination of his established traits—his empathy, guilt, and professional skill—earned with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear, desperate, and consistent. The arc from hollow despair to purposeful creation is earned through the story's central action. Interiority is strong, though a few phrases like "pensive mirth filled her chest" lean slightly toward diagnostic summary rather than fully embodied emotion in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between "unwavering certainty" and a dormant curiosity is established well and drives the central choice. The hobo nickel serves as a solid external correlative for this inner state. However, the final change, while earned, is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity in dialogue ("I chose curiosity over certainty"), which slightly undermines the otherwise well-embodied shift.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly fuels the story's climax. The explicit statement, "His motivation wasn’t glory; it was the simple, vital act of standing guard over that inner spark," is efficient for this length and is validated by his high-risk actions. While his interiority is consistent, it lacks the deeper, contradictory impulses under pressure that would elevate it further; his transition from "charming" to "focused" is more of a toggle than a layered state.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s motivation is profound and consistent, driving the narrative from start to finish. The internal conflict is rendered with evocative, specific imagery ("wars raged within his ribs"), avoiding abstraction. The contradictory trait "shyly unstoppable" is a brilliant touch, perfectly embodied in his quiet, relentless creative process. The final earned stasis feels entirely credible, a direct result of the centuries-long struggle shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her competence is well-balanced with the quiet desperation of her task. The character-particular emotion of "foxglove regret" is a brilliant piece of interiority, grounding the fantastical premise in a specific, contradictory feeling. The final choice to use the full song for "Amaris" is an earned culmination of her knowledge and love, with the cost of exhaustion and tears felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation for redemption is visceral and immediate, rooted in a specific past failure. Her interiority demonstrates a compelling contradiction between "carefully reckless energy" and "hard-won humility," which is earned through the story's events. The character change is legible and satisfying, shown in her shift from trembling hands to steady ones, culminating in the complex, earned emotion of "cautious exuberance."

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and the internal conflict between duty to the present and preservation of the past is well-established. The emotional progression is tracked effectively through the trembling hands, shifting from fatigue to awe. However, the final state of “dappled resolve” feels slightly too swift and articulated, moving from conflict to certainty without a more granular struggle on the page, which slightly softens the earnedness of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear and compelling internal conflict between past deception and present preservation. The central contradiction—the need for perfect control versus the necessity of trust—is dramatized in scene and resolved through a choice with a palpable emotional cost. Elara's interiority is rendered with unique, concrete details, particularly the use of dust motes as a meditative tool, which avoids cliché and feels character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final choice to renounce immediate reunion is a powerful, earned expression of her character arc. Her interiority is concrete and drives the plot forward through her specific way of processing the world. The score is slightly capped by the triple repetition of the attribute "featherly determined," which feels more like a label than an embodied trait by the third use.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her interiority is specific and compelling, particularly the concept of a "landscape astrologer." The arc from seeking an external pattern to feeling an internal, shared rhythm is earned. The final change feels credible, though the sudden, perfectly timed appearance of Kael leans toward convenience, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, her interiority lacks contradiction; she proceeds with high competence, and her defining trait of "cheerful gloom" is more of a label than an embodied, contradictory state shown through action. The emotional beats, like the tears followed by a smile, feel somewhat performed rather than earned through a deeper internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her analytical-artistic nature. However, her characterization lacks a compelling internal conflict or flaw; her hyper-competence and the flawless execution of her plan remove any sense of struggle, making her feel more like a vessel for the concept than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and potent, driving the entire ritualistic scene. Her interiority is richly rendered, though it occasionally strays into abstraction over embodied emotion, as with "the weight of the unspoken." The final transformation is a vast change, earned within the story's accumulative logic, but the characterization lacks a sharp, contradictory internal conflict in the moment; she reads as resolved from the start, which slightly softens the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional. Elias’s internal conflict between the demand for spectacle and his search for substance is made concrete through his actions and perceptions. The final change is earned through a specific, character-driven micro-choice—the observation of the rings—which feels like an extension of his professional skills rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kai's motivation is clear, but the pivotal change feels more intellectual than earned. The interiority becomes overly articulate at the climax, using diagnostic language like "translate this raw, personal agony into a universal language." This abstraction reads like an authorial thesis statement, momentarily breaking from the character's established, embodied emotional state and weakening the story's core emotional transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s characterization as a “logical dreamer” is successfully dramatized through her methodical yet hopeful actions. Her motivation is clear and unwavering despite repeated failures, making her final breakthrough feel earned. The internal conflict between her eroding spirit and firm motivation is palpable, culminating in a credible change in understanding. The story avoids simple labels by grounding her struggle in concrete tasks like arranging shells and recalibrating the gauge.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and evolves compellingly from a personal obsession to a communal purpose. The change is earned through the story's central discovery. However, his core trait of being "sensitively perceptive" reads more as a given ability than a source of genuine struggle or contradiction; a moment of misinterpretation or sensory overload would have added another layer of depth.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The painter’s motivation is singular and clear, and her defining trait—calm—is effectively dramatized as a professional necessity (“panic fractured light”). Her interiority serves the execution of her art, showing focus rather than complex contradiction. While this archetypal portrayal is strong and consistent, it lacks the deeper internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in-scene that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in a specific, catastrophic failure that makes her climactic choice both costly and inevitable. The internal conflict between political pragmatism and the personal need for redemption is dramatized, not summarized, culminating in her choice to admit fault. The characterization is superb, showing contradictory impulses and embodied emotions, as when she calms the "tremor in her own hands" before making a decision that is "political suicide."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thorne’s core contradiction as an "amoral philanthropist" is masterfully dramatized, not just stated. The motivation for his pilgrimage, while irrational, is grounded in the specific, tender memory of a lark feather, making his final act feel earned and inevitable. The internal conflict between his "ruthless calculus" and "secretly sentimental core" is active throughout the scene, culminating in an act of vulnerable, futile grace that pays off the setup with a palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character concept is strong and the motivation is clear, intensified effectively by the memory of her mother. Elara's interiority is well-embodied through her poetic worldview. However, her competence is so flawless—"a living sonnet written in motion"—that the struggle feels more elegant than visceral, softening the sense of genuine risk and leaving her feeling more like a perfect instrument of the theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and the internal conflict is well-realized. However, the final epiphany is articulated with a diagnostic clarity that feels more like a concluding thesis than an embodied, in-the-moment realization. The line "...ethical storytelling wasn’t about avoiding manipulation...but about revealing the strings" is slightly too self-aware, flattening the emotional texture of the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent. Her interiority is specific, though it occasionally relies on abstract labels like "esoteric realist" instead of purely embodied experience. The emotional arc is clear and earned, moving from focused grief to a state of profound witness, with the final shift to "a quiet warmth where grief had been" providing a satisfying, non-sentimental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, transitioning from guilt to a purposeful calm rooted in her craft. Her actions, particularly the delicate handling of the card and rope, are well-aligned with her profession as a caster. The main weakness lies in moments of over-articulated interiority, such as "Forgiveness wasn’t an end; it was the quiet ground from which her purpose finally grew," which feels more like a thematic summary than an embodied thought process in a high-stakes moment.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation and internal conflict are powerfully rendered. Her condition—a specific, debilitating form of perception—is not merely a label but the core of her embodied experience, driving every choice. The contradiction between her knowledge of past/future and inability to act in the present creates genuine struggle, culminating in the earned decision to force herself into the "raw present." The change is credible and paid for with the destruction of the seal and the directive's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is crystalline, and his central contradiction—empirical discipline in pursuit of a sacred mystery—is compellingly dramatized. The interiority is concrete, especially his near-scoff at his own superstition right before the climax, which grounds the subsequent revelation. The change from a seeker pleading with the cosmos to a humble listener is earned and profound, making his final actions feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation as a “scheming pacifist” is a strong hook, but the execution leans more toward pacifist than schemer; her plan feels more like a hopeful placement of a prop than an intricate weave of strategy. Kael’s resentment is clear but his sudden release lacks sufficient internal struggle, feeling more like a switch being flipped than a hard-won change. The dialogue drifts into diagnostic summary (“It’s a prison you built from smoke”), which flattens the emotional complexity of the moment into a therapeutic thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a desire to connect with her grandfather’s legacy. The internal conflict between her practical nature and her impossible quest is established, but her shift from skepticism to acceptance of Silas’s mystical method is very swift. A moment of stronger resistance would have made her final surrender more impactful and her "firmly grounded" trait feel more like a genuine obstacle overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, and her internal conflict between rigid tradition and adaptive love is dramatized effectively through her actions. The shift in her perspective is earned by the discovery of the ribbon, a powerful external catalyst for an internal change. The final beat, where she sees the "same feisty spark" in Liora, provides a perfect, resonant closure to her arc, showing the generational echo she sought in a form she didn't expect.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's progression from "bewildered curator" to an active participant in a temporal loop is compelling and earned. His core contradiction—the directive to observe versus the drive to understand—is dramatized effectively when he picks up the shell. The emotional arc from "brightened disquiet" to "profound, starlit peace" is well-tracked and provides a satisfying closure, with the cost being the loss of his linear worldview. The epiphany is powerful, though its articulation borders on being slightly too neat for a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core choice demonstrates her defining trait ("carefully resourceful"). However, Kael is a functional but thin character, primarily serving as a clock. The articulation of the sacrificed lesson feels slightly too neat and self-aware for a moment of crisis, bordering on diagnostic summary rather than an embodied, contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s motivation is sharp and compelling, and her unique trait of “blissfully aberrant calm” is well-dramatized. However, her interiority sometimes leans on articulating the story’s core concepts (e.g., “unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom”) as direct labels. This slightly subordinates embodied emotion to thematic summary, making her feel more like a vessel for the ideas than a person fully experiencing them in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her primary trait of being “methodical” is well-demonstrated in the climactic action. However, her interiority relies on summary and abstract labels (“clarity flooded Elara,” “a lesson in trust”) rather than embodied experience. The story tells us her emotional and intellectual shifts instead of letting the reader experience them through her specific, moment-to-moment perceptions, which keeps the character at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is viscerally established and her competence as a "mapkeeper" is demonstrated through action, not summary. Her internal state is well-embodied, progressing from the ache of dissonance to the earned "hammered repose." The final state is a credible result of the preceding struggle and cost (exhaustion), fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully clear and consistent, driving the narrative with conviction. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into thematic summary, most notably in the final paragraph: "The coincidences were real...proving meaning endured." This direct statement of the theme slightly undermines the earned emotion of the climax, making the character a temporary mouthpiece for the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between experiencing the raw moment and the duty to preserve it is well-realized. The concept of being "preemptively nostalgic" provides a strong, specific emotional core. The characterization is slightly weakened by a moment of over-articulated self-awareness—"She realized her own purpose mirrored this process..."—which reads more like a thematic statement than a raw, in-the-moment epiphany, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elara’s motivation to defy her “gravity of hopelessness” is established with physical weight, and her internal conflict is dramatized through the tension between this weight and her focusing chant. The final choice to light the rag is a perfectly scaled act of defiance, earned by the preceding beats, and the shift in her chant from "See" to "Create" provides a resonant, character-driven closure that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation is established with depth and specificity, rooted in her profession and philosophy. Her interiority is concrete, avoiding cliché and directly driving her micro-choices, such as shifting her focus to the droplet. The final change in stance is earned through a believable, character-particular process of reflection, fulfilling the story's central drive with a felt, though not yet paid, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her final transformation from collector to nurturer is earned through on-page struggle. The character arc is compelling and clear, showing a contradictory impulse (precision vs. desperation) that forces a costly choice. The epiphany is slightly over-articulated in prose but immediately grounded by a decisive action, preserving its integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the plot. However, his characterization as a purely competent, sensitive healer lacks significant internal contradiction on the page. The repeated label "fluidly logical" functions as a shortcut, telling the reader about his nature rather than consistently embodying it through more varied choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara's motivation as a "wisely adventurous" lore keeper is clearly demonstrated through her cautious yet determined actions. However, her interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels like "futuristic nostalgia" and her pivotal realization about the throne's purpose reads more like an authorial theme summary than a hard-won, embodied epiphany. The final choice is consistent, but the internal conflict lacks sharp, contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, rooting Elara's motivation and unique abilities in a well-realized internal contradiction between her duty of severance and her method of connection. The use of her own scars as a bridge to the dead is a powerful and concrete embodiment of her internal state. The final choice is earned, with a clear cost that reaffirms her character, meeting the 9+ standard for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation as a pyramid scheme survivor is established early and directly fuels her on-page actions, from building the press to the final confrontation. Her internal state, a mix of "virtuously mischievous" resolve and the "cold dread" of past trauma, feels earned and is compellingly dramatized. The final choice is a perfect, inevitable expression of her established character, meeting the 9+ test for contradictory impulses acting in a scene with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and drives the narrative with purpose. The shift in her understanding of being the "dynasty ender" is earned through the story's central action, providing a satisfying character arc. Her interiority is well-rendered, though some phrasing like "intuition as deep as the estate’s foundations" verges on abstraction. The final choice to accept the truth and carry it forward demonstrates a clear, costly change from her initial goal to simply "sever" the past.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Torin's motivation and arc from withdrawn despair to active restoration are clear and compelling. The backstory of his failure and the Oracle's vow provides a strong foundation for his change. The final emotional state is potent, though the description ("profound, bone-deep warmth flooding his weary limbs") leans slightly on familiar phrasing, just shy of the specificity seen elsewhere in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, shifting credibly from grief-induced apathy to a reignited sense of purpose. The internal conflict is present, but the final epiphany feels overly articulated and tidy. The line "Her own heartbreak felt suddenly less isolating" is a diagnostic summary rather than an embodied experience, slightly cheapening the emotional journey by resolving it too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply personal, rooted in his sister's erasure. This quiet fury credibly fuels his high-stakes actions, culminating in the powerful choice to stand his ground during the transmission rather than flee. This final micro-choice, embodying his commitment to "hold the line," is earned through prior causality and carries a visible cost, perfectly satisfying the demands for a compelling protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The character's motivation is clear and rooted in legacy, with strong interiority and embodied emotion. His micro-choices, like the "reverent slowness" of assembling the sax, reveal character effectively. However, the piece prioritizes concept over deep internal conflict; Elias is resolute and skilled, lacking the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene that would elevate the characterization to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her "mossy delight" and reverence for nature's order. The choice to abandon her sorting chest to build the chaotic monuments provides a meaningful character turn, demonstrating a shift in her values from passive preservation to active remembrance. Interiority is concrete, though it sometimes relies on familiar phrasing like "Hope, fragile as a seedling, bloomed in her chest," which slightly tempers an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, consistent, and well-rooted in a past failure (the music box). The internal conflict between a need for precision and a desire to embrace uncertainty is dramatized effectively, particularly in the climax. The final emotional shift is earned through action, fulfilling the story's core promise with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Silas is excellent, presenting a clear internal conflict between his methodical nature and the chaotic force of grief. His motivation is compelling, and the arc from seeking a 'fix' to seeking acceptance is earned through the failed and successful attempts at repair. The moment of his shift feels authentic, rooted in specific memories of Elara, avoiding a generic epiphany. A slight deduction for the summary statement "The balanced alchemist finally saw the imbalance within himself," which verges on diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence is established effectively for this length. The spirit's internal conflict—shame over an involuntary reflex—is a strong, particularized source of torment. The line "Elara understood her motivation instantly" borders on an unearned epiphany, but is justified as professional intuition. However, the articulation of her goal, "to integrate laughter into healing," veers close to diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the immediacy of her insight in a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. Kael's motivation is primal and clear, while his internal conflict between traumatic memory and analytical survival is dramatized through his enhanced senses. The transformation from a passive victim of trauma responses to an active navigator of his pain is earned and compelling. The final choice—to step forward and learn the forest's language—is a powerful culmination of his internal struggle, paid for with "aching grace."

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, anchored effectively by her personal history with her grandmother. However, her progression through the puzzle is frictionless; she encounters no setbacks, misinterpretations, or moments of genuine doubt. This flawless competence makes her feel more like a vehicle for the plot's unfolding than a character genuinely struggling against an obstacle, slightly flattening the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and demonstrated through action rather than just statement. The concept of his "weightless burden" is established early and paid off effectively in the final lines, showing a credible change. His competence is balanced by the quiet sorrow of his gift, creating a well-rounded and compelling protagonist for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is consistently presented and drives his actions, but its declaration ("His motivation was clear") feels more told than shown. The interiority is rich in world-perception but lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied emotional stress that would elevate the characterization from highly competent to exceptional. His path is linear, without the micro-choices under pressure that reveal a deeper hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in her past as a "fiery revolutionary" now grappling with the consequences. The internal conflict between her "burnished sorrow" and "fierce" motivation is well-established, culminating in a powerful, earned change. Her final realization, where sorrow becomes "absolute," is a perfect character closure, foreclosing any hope of redemption and landing with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.6)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and embodied. The internal conflict is dramatized, not summarized, through the "covenant of rust"—a concept that externalizes the cost of truth in his scarred hands and the metallic taste in his mouth. This isn't just a label; it's a constant, physical pressure that gives his struggle immense weight and credibility, making his final endurance fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's motivation is crystalline and compelling: she seeks "the place where explanations failed." Her character is revealed through her specific, lived-in details—the "sensibly eccentric attire," the failed grant proposals—which ground her quest in a believable history of intellectual obsession. The final choice to abandon her instruments is a powerful, earned renunciation of her core identity, showing a profound change with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal journey is the core of the story. However, her interiority sometimes becomes overly articulate, stating the story's themes with a diagnostic clarity that feels less like a character in crisis and more like an authorial summary. For instance, "Her motivation crystallized: to scaffold the ocean’s wild chaos..." is an abstraction that replaces a more embodied emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied, particularly in the opening. The final shift in her artistic approach from "shouting her pain onto blank walls" to "umbral tenderness" marks a credible change. However, the articulation of her epiphany feels slightly too diagnostic and self-aware for a moment of profound realization, bordering on summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, driven by professional duty and the personal cost of the psychic intrusions. His interiority is well-embodied, particularly during the climax ("heart hammering against his ribs"). The character's core struggle feels genuine, but the repeated use of the clinical-sounding label "retrocognitively trapped" slightly distances the reader from the raw experience. The final sentence's self-assessment ("clear-eyed and unbroken") is a touch too neat, summarizing the change rather than letting the prior action embody it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the transition from rejecting illusion to the grand ambition of "reimagining an entire civilization" feels slightly abrupt. The internal conflict is presented more as a sequential choice—rejecting despair, then embracing creation—rather than a simultaneous, deeply felt struggle. While his final change is earned by the story's end, the initial leap in scale could be better bridged.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, shifting from a professional obsession with preservation to a personal reckoning with annihilation. Elias’s interiority is concrete, particularly the link between his adult self and the eight-year-old’s "illicit curiosity." The final turn—feeling the end "not as a scribe, but as a man"—is earned and provides a strong, if slightly declarative, character closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly the dramatization of the core contradiction "furiously tranquil." The protagonist's interiority is concrete and her shift from guardian to one who has "felt time's grain" is earned through the climax. Her motivation is clear and her micro-choices under pressure feel purposeful and reveal her deep competence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between protocol and intuitive listening is dramatized with concrete, simultaneous impulses, particularly in the moment her fingers hover over the switch. Elara's motivation is consistent and deepens under pressure, and her final act of renunciation—choosing the bell over the siren—is an earned moment of Earned Stasis with the clear cost of professional defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s motivation is powerfully established and consistently drives his actions. The internal conflict between his grief and his search for purpose is palpable, and his choice during the storm feels earned. The final emotional state is a credible evolution from the opening, showing a character who has endured and been changed. A slight deduction is for the moment of diagnostic self-awareness in the final paragraph, which verges on summarizing the character's change rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in an earned renunciation (active listening over passive guardianship). However, the characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels like "tranquilly perceptive recluse" rather than fully embodying these traits through action and nuanced interiority. The emotional state of "astonishment" is stated but not deeply dramatized, making his inner world feel slightly summarized rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, grounding an abstract concept (“feel time’s texture”) in a concrete goal. However, her reaction to the climax—discovering the message is from her past self—is emotionally understated. A simple gasp before moving to understanding and action misses an opportunity to embody the profound shock of this revelation, slightly thinning the characterization at its peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her core traits are often stated ("warmly attentive," "characteristic tenderness") rather than purely dramatized. The internal conflict between her grand concept and her appreciation for fragments is well-drawn. However, the final paragraph summarizes her epiphany with diagnostic clarity ("woven dawns were born from fragments..."), which flattens the earned, in-scene discovery into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aris’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained by the terminal diagnosis, making his actions feel urgent and meaningful. His defining trait of "brazen calm" is consistently reinforced through his methodical work. However, this same consistency borders on being one-note, as the character lacks a significant moment of internal contradiction or vulnerability on the page, reading more as a serene force of will than a complex individual grappling with mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in a credible professional rebellion. Her interiority is sharp, balancing scientific rigor with an intuitive pursuit of a "poetic metaphor," which creates a sustained internal contradiction. The final emotional release is earned by the weight of her established intellectual isolation, fulfilling the 9+ test of a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in past trauma and embodied through patient, ritualistic action. The characterization is strong, particularly in how his unique skill directly serves his core drive. A minor deduction for the slightly declarative line "His motivation burned simple," which tells what the rest of the story shows with such elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. The motivation to "translate distance into closeness" is established and then earned through action. The shift from a creature of scent to one of sight-based interpretation is a potent and credible character turn, and the final emotional release is powerfully understated and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to find purpose in her isolation is clear and compelling. The contradiction of being a "blessed pariah" provides a strong internal conflict, and her final choice feels earned. However, some interiority verges on the diagnostic, such as the line "to transform her confusion into exploration," which summarizes the emotional arc a bit too neatly instead of letting the actions carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies too heavily on received philosophical labels from his master ("dancing with chaos," "sacred play"). While the moment of fear when the ice cracks provides a brief glimpse of internal conflict, he overcomes it so swiftly by recalling a lesson that he feels more like a perfect vessel for the story's concept than a person grappling with genuine struggle. His competence is admirable but leaves little room for flaw-driven complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in the compelling contradiction between her past as a crisis actor and her present as a true survivor. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through her mission to record others' truths while suppressing her own. The final change is earned, triggered by a specific, potent catalyst, and the cost—confronting her erased trauma—is palpable. The characterization is strong, though the description "benevolently ruthless" feels more asserted than demonstrated; the "ruthless" aspect lacks a clear on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and her core internal conflict—the desire for knowledge versus the pain of memory—is dramatized effectively. The resolution, confronting her "buried talent" to redefine home, is an earned change with a visible emotional cost (tears). The characterization is strong, though the sudden surge of the buried talent feels slightly more like a unlocked feature than a continuous internal struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her expertise as a chess strategist is well-integrated into the plot. The internal conflict is present, but the resolution feels slightly too articulate and therapeutic, particularly the line "Forgiveness, she understood, wasn’t about erasing the past but integrating its lessons," which reads more like a summary of the theme than an embodied, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is sharp and consistent, driving the narrative. Vanya's transformation, while powerful, feels slightly abrupt; the shift from "hard as the towers" to tearful acceptance hinges entirely on a single visual metaphor, making the internal process feel compressed. The dialogue, particularly Kael's "It’s a cage," verges on articulating the theme directly rather than embodying it through subtext, which slightly flattens the character's complexity at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between doubt and desperation is legible. The final choice to accept oblivion feels earned by the story's internal logic. However, her interiority occasionally slips into direct thematic summary, such as stating her motivation is "to conjure meaning," slightly flattening the character's voice into the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's characterization is strong and her motivation is compellingly rendered. The internal conflict between clinging to memory and the need for release is palpable, culminating in an earned transformation. Her initial state as "intimately aloof" provides a clear baseline, and the final shift is credible. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak for the most part, though a phrase like "her intimately aloof nature had kept her tethered to memory" comes close to summarizing rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eli's motivation is exceptionally clear, driven by the dual pressures of the immediate crisis and the need to validate Mara's philosophy. The interiority is specific and embodied, particularly the contrast between his "frantic rhythm" heart and "steady" hands, which dramatizes his internal conflict. The concept of "screaming tenderness" is a brilliant, character-particular insight that elevates the climax beyond a simple magical act into a profound emotional expression.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aris’s motivation is powerfully embodied in their patchwork physicality and grief. The internal conflict between duty and despair is palpable, and the final micro-choice to use tears is an earned, character-particular action. The contradiction between their technical skill as a navigator and their reliance on a mystical relic creates a compelling tension that drives the story to its resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives every action. The internal conflict between her trained rationality and her desperate need for relief is shown, not just told, culminating in a choice that feels both inevitable and costly. The transformation of her understanding of "psychological safety" provides a satisfying, earned character arc that lands with the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in his established eccentricity and isolation. The internal conflict between his solitary nature and the sudden, intrusive intimacy of the stranger's memories is palpable. The final shift from decoding a puzzle to accepting a "promise" is earned through the narrative's emotional progression, with the felt cost of a "borrowed ache" making the change credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in loneliness and a legacy promise. The shift from seeking an escape to accepting his own path is earned. The repeated label "empirically intuitive" is a minor crutch; while the story shows this trait in action (following the ants), the insistence on the label itself slightly undermines the interiority's concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The characterization is very strong, establishing Elara’s disenchantment through concrete internal states ("hollow rhythm," "drowned the music") rather than labels. Her motivation shifts compellingly from personal mystery-solving to regal duty, anchored by the specific, powerful memory of her daughter. The final transformation is earned, though the line "shed her weariness like a discarded cloak" is a minor cliché that slightly flattens an otherwise nuanced moment of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and undergoes a powerful, earned transformation from a detached alchemist to an engaged friend. The internal conflict between scientific observation and human connection is dramatized effectively in the climax. The final choice to renounce her initial goal has a tangible, felt cost. The characterization is slightly weakened by a few lines of over-articulated interiority near the end, such as "the most precise instrument...was the human heart," which summarizes the epiphany rather than letting the action fully embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal conflict is rendered with specificity, particularly the "hot, shameful jealousy" for a past self. The emotional progression from fighting this feeling to acknowledging it ("I see you. I miss you.") is earned and powerful, leading to a credible change. Minor deductions are for a few instances of diagnostic phrasing like "chronologically confused dread" and "feral nostalgia," which read slightly more like authorial labels than purely embodied character thought, though they do establish a consistent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, conveyed through subtle action and precise interiority. The motivations of both Elara and Chen are rooted in past trauma, creating a believable foundation for their quiet connection. The micro-choice to polish the bowl is a perfect, earned action that reveals Elara’s shift from passive observer to active participant in creating a moment of shared healing, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s motivation and internal conflict are powerfully embodied through the crystallization. The shift from a scholar fearing failure to a storyteller embracing his past is earned and compelling. However, the final paragraph summarizes his transformation with diagnostic clarity ("not a curse but a compass"), slightly flattening the earned complexity by stating what the preceding actions had already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is sharp, consistent, and rooted in a specific past action, giving her immediate depth. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through her self-correction ("You can’t apologize to a memory... You advise through metaphors now"), effectively showing her process. Her unique professional history informs her voice and tactics, creating a character who reads as a genuine, flawed individual rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias serves more as a philosophical vessel than a character with deep, contradictory interiority. His motivation is clear and consistent, but his emotional state ("quiet urgency," "ancient sorrow") is declared rather than embodied. While his final action is earned by the story's conceptual logic, the characterization lacks the specific, flawed humanity needed to elevate it, reading as a function of the plot's abstract machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, driving the story's contemplative action. His interiority is rich, and the final shift in understanding feels earned by the preceding ritual. The characterization is slightly constrained by a narrative voice that can feel more authorial than character-particular, keeping it just shy of a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara's motivation pivots from duty to curiosity in a single sentence without sufficient grounding, making her subsequent choices feel pre-determined rather than earned. Her internal state is conveyed through abstract, diagnostic labels like "revolutionized her own understanding in that instant," which summarizes change rather than dramatizing a difficult internal process. The core conflict between her professional responsibility and her curiosity is resolved without any tangible struggle or contradictory impulses shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal conflict is well-established and her motivation to reconcile her ordered worldview with her father's chaos is compelling. The progression feels earned through her journey. However, the character's interiority occasionally veers into overly diagnostic self-awareness, such as labeling her past self as "theoretically rebellious," which slightly undermines the emotional immediacy of her crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a desire for "cultivated estrangement" as a shield. The internal conflict is expertly dramatized in the final scene; his flatly stated "Wrong number" is immediately contradicted by his tightening throat, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to hang up is a powerful act of renunciation, an earned stasis where the cost of maintaining his isolation is keenly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply felt, rooted in both her profession and her personal history with the locket. The internal conflict culminates powerfully in the "haunted euphoria," a perfectly embodied contradiction. The choice to engage the teenagers rather than retreat into private ritual is a meaningful, character-driven turn that demonstrates her values under pressure. A minor deduction is for moments where interiority verges on self-analysis, slightly too articulate for the moment (e.g., "Her work wasn’t nostalgia; it was resistance...").

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.5)
    Aris Thorne's characterization is superb, driven by the potent internal conflict between his "desperately jocular" mask and the "raw ache beneath." This contradiction is not merely stated but embodied in his actions and dialogue, culminating in the masterful slip, "Asking for a friend. A very lonely friend. Me." The final change in his demeanor is earned through the narrative's central struggle, moving from a flawed, transactional view of connection to a more profound understanding, making the closure deeply satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully embodied through her unique sensory experience, making her grief tactile and immediate. The internal conflict is clear, particularly when panic flares against her brother’s remembered wisdom. The final change from seeking an external place to forging an internal state is earned and resonant, but a few moments of interiority, like "charting valleys of regret and peaks of rage," read as polished summary rather than in-the-moment perception, slightly flattening her voice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, but her interiority relies too heavily on summarizing its own theme, particularly with the recurring "thresh meaning" motif. The final realization feels more like a diagnostic statement ("Elara realized meaning wasn’t in the harvest but in the threshing") than an embodied, earned epiphany emerging from the action. This self-analysis at the climax flattens the character's internal journey into a thesis statement, reducing the moment's emotional power.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and compellingly specific. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, particularly the final, complex feeling of "joy... tangled with sorrow," which is earned by the preceding events. Kael serves as a perfect catalyst, his presence defined by action and subtext rather than exposition, making their fluid, silent rapport feel authentic and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her defining contradiction—guardian as arsonist—is potent. The final choice feels earned by her journey through the archive. However, the interiority occasionally relies on convenient labels like "analytically intuitive mind" or the repeated "volcanic tenderness," which state the emotion more than they embody it through specific, granular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation is singular, clear, and powerfully dramatized through her internal framing of the therapy as "rebellion." The contradictory impulses—hopeful defiance through drumming versus the crushing reality of the machine's limits—act simultaneously in the climax. The final earned stasis is potent, with the cost of her attempt made tangible in the line, "the quiet rebellion complete and the dream, once more, extinguished."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and his competence is well-demonstrated, but his characterization lacks depth. He functions more as a set of impressive skills than a person with internal conflict or meaningful flaws; his success feels assured, which slightly lowers the emotional stakes. The absence of a genuine struggle or a moment of self-doubt makes the journey feel more like a flawless execution than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian is a consistent and compelling archetype, but characterization relies more on elegant description than embodied interiority. Motivation is articulated as a thematic mission statement ("to teach darkness the value of stars") rather than emerging from a deeper, contradictory personal need. The lack of internal friction or a visible flaw makes the character feel more like a beautiful, symbolic vessel than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her final interaction with the chess student is emotionally resonant. The character is mostly strong, but the internal conflict feels more stated than dramatized; we're told about the "symphony of doubt" she perceives, but we don't feel her struggle with contradictory impulses in the moment. The core motivation, "to plant forests of second thoughts," is a touch too thematically articulate, bordering on authorial summary rather than raw character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between fear and innate belonging is well-dramatized. The characterization is strong, showing her alienation through specific details like being the "sea girl." However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly diagnostic language, such as when the magic is described as a "combative tenderness that demanded she face what she’d denied," which slightly undermines the organic feel of her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is consistently dramatized, not just stated. The internal conflict between self-preservation and the need for authentic expression is made tangible through her actions—the whittling as both shield and metaphor. The final choice to offer a subversive truth to Mrs. Gable is an earned culmination of her quiet practice, making her a complex and compelling character whose endurance feels active, not passive.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. However, her interiority is more intellectual than embodied; phrases like "a tremor of certainty" and "conviction as solid as bedrock" articulate a state rather than dramatizing a struggle. The character lacks the contradictory impulses or moments of doubt that would give her depth, reading more as a confident vessel for the story's theme than a person experiencing a profound transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lysander's motivation to find beauty in imperfection is not just stated but embodied in his every action, from his use of the reed to the final, earned epiphany. The choice to offer his most vital tool is a powerful reveal of his values under pressure, making his final transformation feel inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and her internal arc—shifting from seeking a sound to feeling a texture—is earned through on-page discovery. The change is crystallized in the final act, with the cost of dissolving the historical artifact. The characterization is strong, but slightly held back by motivation being stated in thesis-like terms ("Her motivation burned simple yet profound..."), which feels less organic than if it were purely demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and consistent, progressing from a well-embodied grief to a fragile but determined agency. The internal conflict is shown effectively through the contrast between her old work and new intentions. The phrase "subdued ardor" is a particularly strong piece of interiority, capturing a complex emotional state perfectly without resorting to cliché. The final shift to action feels earned within the story's compressed timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's motivation as a "scholar" seeking patterns is strong and consistent, driving her unique actions. Maya serves as an effective, if brief, crucible, forcing Elara to articulate her purpose. The primary weakness is that the dialogue, particularly Elara's explanations and Maya's final realization ("You’re mapping *ours*"), feels slightly too articulate and thesis-like, functioning more to explain the concept to the reader than as purely organic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her internal conflict—feeling the pull of memories while actively shattering the patterns they form—is dramatized with precision. The contradiction between the desire for knowledge and the simultaneous rejection of its addictive form is shown, not just told. The final moment of "anguished joy" feels earned, a complex resolution rooted in the preceding struggle, successfully fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is singular and powerfully rendered, driving the plot with focus. Her interiority, however, occasionally relies on abstract labels ("a fragile geometry," "luminous regret") rather than fully embodied experience, particularly at the climax. The final emotional state is named more than it is viscerally shown, which slightly undercuts the power of her earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between professional duty and personal compassion is well-dramatized through her actions. The conflict feels embodied, especially in the deliberate, gentle movements she uses to care for the chameleon. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly diagnostic language, such as when she explicitly names her goal "to balance self-respect and compassion," which slightly undermines the otherwise strong, demonstrated characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is powerful and consistent, rooted in specific grief. The internal conflict between his surgical impulse to cut and his emergent need to listen is well-dramatized. The final shift is earned, but a few lines verge on diagnostic self-awareness ("He was a closure seeker"), slightly thinning the interiority's texture in an otherwise strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is explicit and consistently drives her actions. However, her interiority sometimes relies on labels to explain her abilities, such as "Her spatially imaginative mind mapped," rather than fully embodying this trait in her perception. While her competence is clear, the personal need behind her quest remains abstract, slightly flattening the emotional stakes of her final, self-sacrificing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her defining trait as a "moonstruck dreamer." The interiority is specific and moving, particularly the contradictory emotion of "shadowed rapture," which perfectly marries the ecstatic beauty of the moment with the melancholy of its cause. The final choice is earned through a credible struggle, and the cost of her exhaustion is made tangible, fulfilling the 9+ criteria for characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation and internal state are rendered with specificity and depth, particularly through his attachment to the chess clock. The shift from a vigilant but despairing guard to a cultivator of new life is compelling. The final realization is slightly over-articulated ("He understood his true motivation now..."), a minor tell in a story that otherwise masterfully shows his internal transformation through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc is complete, but the resolution relies on overly diagnostic interiority. The final epiphanies (“She saw how her civilized thoughts had armored her against vulnerability... mistaking control for wisdom”) read less like an in-the-moment realization and more like a summary of the story’s theme, slightly undermining the earned, embodied change.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract, slightly generic phrasing ("heart beat a shoreline lullaby") rather than character-particular embodiment. The final change is earned within the story's allegorical framework. The ferry guides are effective archetypes, but Elara herself lacks sharp internal contradiction in-scene; her journey is a smooth, linear progression toward an epiphany, which slightly flattens her character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict between survival and identity is well-realized. The choice to endure is earned by the story's events. However, the late introduction of the "fire drill" backstory feels like a slightly too-convenient intensification of her guilt, and some interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("terrible arithmetic," "cobalt purgatory") rather than purely embodied emotion in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris is a well-realized character whose motivation and defining traits are demonstrated consistently through action. The contrast between his diminutive size and solemn duty is effective. However, Varek and Elara function more as archetypes—the arrogant usurper and the passive chosen one—lacking the interiority or contradictory impulses needed for the highest tier of characterization. Aris's final, quiet assertion of power is excellent, but the supporting cast is too thin to elevate the overall score further.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his past as a witness to the Great Bleaching. His interiority is effectively embodied through the tapping rhythm, which physically manifests his emotional state. The final shift to a steady, resigned beat demonstrates an earned change, accepting the cost of his discovery—the loss of hope. While strong, the internal conflict feels more like a progression from sorrow to resignation rather than a moment-to-moment battle of contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are a direct, earned consequence of her internal state. The shift from seeking cosmic patterns to terrestrial ones is a strong character-revealing choice. The label "awkwardly confident" is effectively dramatized in her "clumsy and sure" laugh, demonstrating a character whose actions outpace her self-perception.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation to "evolve tradition with intent" is clear, consistent, and drives the entire plot. Her final choice feels earned, crystallizing her stance as an "insurgent" with a legible social cost. The characterization is strong, though some interiority, like "Elara’s heart ached," is more declared than embodied, and the character lacks complex internal flaws beyond her principled opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and deeply embodied, particularly the contradiction between her fragility and resolve. The motivation is clear and compelling. The score is slightly capped by the use of somewhat clinical, diagnostic language like "somatic markers," which feels more like a narrator's label than a character's internal vocabulary during a crisis, subtly flattening the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptionally strong. Elara’s motivation is clear, and her internal conflict is rendered through specific, embodied details rather than summary. The transition from crestfallen artist to purposeful survivor is earned through the central symbolic act. The final choice feels like an inevitable culmination of her internal struggle, with the cost of her newfound purpose made tangible in the line, "The ache in her chest hadn’t vanished, but it burned now with purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is potent and intensely personal, driving every action. The central character concept of "serene anger" is exceptional—a specific, contradictory internal state that is demonstrated rather than merely labeled, and which deepens into "a rage made quiet by absolute comprehension" at the close. The choice to consciously relive trauma to pursue her goal is a powerful crucible that earns the final, devastating epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is clear and her central conflict—"bravely conflicted"—is effectively dramatized through her hesitation and subsequent decisive action under pressure. The arc from conflicted to resolved is earned by the story's events. The score is capped below 9.0 because the repeated label "bravely conflicted" feels slightly told rather than purely shown, abstracting an otherwise well-embodied internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a deeply embodied internal conflict between her pacifist heart and her father's violent legacy. The contradiction is dramatized beautifully in the climax, where the impulse to draw the dagger is palpable but overcome by an earned, deliberate choice to nurture. Her actions consistently align with her established motives, making the final renunciation of violence feel both surprising and inevitable, with the cost felt in the intense risk of the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kael's core trait as a "cool-headed fisher" is not merely stated but demonstrated through his patience and steady hands under immense pressure. The story masterfully embodies his emotions—"calm fear" and "desperate hope"—through the tangible vibration of the rail spike, avoiding abstract labels and creating a specific, resonant interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between corporate caution and journalistic courage is well-realized. Her observant nature is effectively dramatized in her methodical problem-solving. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated in the line "...it was about breaking the orbit of regret that had haunted her," which verges on diagnostic self-awareness rather than a purely embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and potent, rooted in a specific and embodied guilt. The change from tattooing stars to performing the tether ritual is a strong micro-choice that demonstrates an earned shift in tactics. However, the emotional progression feels slightly compressed, and the character's internal struggle is somewhat short-circuited by the convenient discovery of the letters, which provides external absolution rather than forcing a more difficult internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is consistently clear and drives the central action. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly her desire to "discover meaning in the mess," which aligns with her actions. The story effectively embodies the group's emotions (Torin's jaw, Lissa's hands), but Elara's own emotional state occasionally relies on diagnostic labels like "her whimsy tempered by gravity," which slightly lessens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but the characterization relies on direct thematic labels like "gentle radical" and "cradle empathy in arms of steel." The internal conflict is less a struggle of contradictory impulses and more a process of discovery. Varr serves his function as an antagonist but feels more like a narrative obstacle than a fully realized character, his change of heart happening very quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and compelling, anchored in her desperation to mend a past failure before her anchor is destroyed. Her internal conflict is embodied through the synesthetic details, and her final choice—to save the child rather than herself in the re-lived moment—is a powerful, earned action that demonstrates a clear hierarchy of values. The emotional shift from despair to melancholic nostalgia is a meaningful change, foreclosing the path of total failure with a felt, resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s motivation is sharp and evolves credibly from grappling with failure to pursuing a purer scientific inquiry. The "affectionate skeptic" trait is not just a label; it underpins his ability to diagnose the failure correctly, turning a disaster into a new research direction. His internal conflict and interaction with Lena are handled with nuance, making his final shift toward a new kind of understanding feel earned and resonant, satisfying the 9+ test of contradictory impulses leading to a costly, earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her professional mindset provides a strong anchor for her interiority. The shift from a private, anxious reliance on the fossil to a purposeful, communal understanding is earned by the story's climax. The internal conflict between scientific observation and personal panic is tangible, particularly in the line where she "relied on it to steady her breathing." A few phrases like "trembling with purpose" verge on cliché, slightly softening the landing, but the overall arc is compelling and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is established immediately and compellingly, driving every micro-choice. The interiority is concrete, especially the translation of the mentor’s wisdom into a physical sensation (“settle in her bones”). Her struggle is brief but believable, grounded in the “three brass buttons,” which prevents the final epiphany from feeling unearned. The final choice to descend is a perfect culmination of her established traits, and the cost—a schism with the elders—is clearly anticipated, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in both professional redemption and personal atonement. The choice to “vouchsafe” his own work is a powerful, earned character moment that crystallizes his internal shift. However, the interiority occasionally relies on over-articulated thematic labels like “unused courage” and “fixing what’s broken,” which reads more like a summary of his state than an embodied experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas is a masterfully drawn character for this length. His motivation is clear and embodied in his actions, particularly the mending of the rope. The internal conflict—the need for stillness versus the imperative to act—is handled with subtlety, and his competence is balanced by the genuine external threat, avoiding any sense of invulnerability. The backstory of the promise is integrated well, directly fueling his present-tense choices rather than feeling like an expositional insert. The character is a complete, compelling creation within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaito’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "zen-minded potter" persona. The interiority is specific, connecting his craft to his perception of the world. The final choice to leave an offering is earned through his journey of understanding. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments where his epiphanies are articulated with a diagnostic clarity that feels more authorial than in-character, preventing the highest score.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her "wistfully pragmatic" nature. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in the feeling of "protected vulnerability." However, the characterization lacks a moment of sharp internal contradiction acting *in scene*; her wistfulness and pragmatism are presented as a settled, harmonious state rather than a source of active tension, which keeps the characterization just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict is embodied well, particularly in the line about screaming until her throat bled. The arc from shielded isolation to a vessel of coexistence is earned and satisfying. However, the final thoughts verge on being slightly too articulate and diagnostic, momentarily pulling back from the raw, embodied experience that characterized the story's setup.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc is emotionally resonant. The core weakness is an over-articulated interiority that occasionally slips into diagnostic summary. Phrases like "the sense that she curated connections but never truly joined them" read more like a thesis statement than an embodied feeling, slightly undercutting the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris's motivation is sharp and consistent, crystallizing from a general hopefulness into a specific goal: outwitting the tricksters. The character’s internal conflict between scientific focus and terrestrial chaos is well-drawn, culminating in an earned choice to merge the two by confronting the crowd. A few moments of interiority verge on being overly articulated (e.g., "felt the familiar weight of the core concept"), but his actions—especially the unorthodox repurposing of the grounding rods—reveal a compelling blend of desperation and competence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between claustrophobic dread and duty is well-embodied. The moment of "wistful rebellion" provides a strong, character-particular insight that deepens her beyond a simple hero archetype. However, the core trait of "prudently adventurous" feels more like a label than a dramatized contradiction; the prudent action of checking for traps is brief and doesn't feel like it costs her adventurous impulse anything in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation and core contradiction are clear and compelling, driving her unique approach to the case. However, the interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic self-awareness ("Elena’s motivation was clear..."), which slightly undermines the character's lived experience. The witness character, while functional, feels more like a plot device than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her interiority is well-embodied, particularly the "spongey dread." The final choice to stay is earned and demonstrates a clear arc. However, the repeated use of the exact phrase "nervously confident" feels like a label rather than a fully dramatized contradiction, slightly flattening the otherwise nuanced characterization in those moments.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fiddler’s motivation is intensely clear but suffers from being stated in identical, label-like phrases ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"). While his actions align with his motives, the interiority relies on abstract concepts like "pixelated amnesty" rather than fully embodied emotion. The core internal conflict is present, but its resolution feels more like a symbolic discovery than a choice shaped by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s internal conflict between the inherited impulse to flee and a new need to confront his legacy is well-dramatized and consistent. The central contradiction of his "polished calm" shielding an inner panic feels authentic and drives the story's tension. The final change is earned through his climactic action, making his shift from running to accepting a credible arc. The characterization is strong, showing contradictory impulses in action rather than just stating them.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is fierce and clear, driving the narrative from the first paragraph. Her internal arc from shouldering a solitary burden to feeling carried by a shared one is earned through the story's central revelation. The final emotional change is embodied and avoids simple resolution, landing on a complex state of solace where "grief and purpose intertwined," satisfying the 9+ test for earned change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his final change is earned, moving from confronting personal shame to accepting a more complex historical truth. The characterization is consistent, but relies on some stock fantasy phrasing ("eyes sharp as flint," "guarded druid") that keeps it from feeling truly singular. His defining trait of "warlike serenity" is stated more than it is tested through contradictory impulses until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc from bondage to communion is well-defined. The internal change is earned through her ritualistic actions. However, the interiority is slightly weakened by the repetition of stock emotional phrases like "anxious elation," which reads more as a label than a uniquely embodied experience, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied, driven by the “wound that festered in the marrow.” Her defining trait of a “reckless idealist” is not just stated but demonstrated through the high-stakes ritual. The internal conflict is shown through the juxtaposition of her gentle handling of the card and the “unyielding glint of river stone” in her eyes, earning the final transformation into a keeper who endures rather than mends.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Liam’s internal conflict between the methodical appraiser and the intuitive roadie is dramatized effectively through his interaction with the cloth scrap. The motivation to reclaim purpose is clear and the final shift is earned through a specific, memory-cued realization, avoiding a generic epiphany. The contradictory impulses of insulating with facts versus engaging with painful memory are active in the scene, culminating in a costly but credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The motivation, a blend of scholarly curiosity and profound grief, is clear and compelling, driving every action. The final contradictory state—achieving intellectual triumph while feeling the keen sting of emotional distance—is masterfully rendered and earned, particularly in the line "the understanding of her *experience* was a distance he could only touch, never cross."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between the weight of duty and her resolve is well-realized. The character's final transformation, where routine becomes "wings," is earned through the central action of smelting. However, her interiority sometimes articulates the story's themes with too much precision, as in the axiom "Contradiction is the ore; truth is the alloy," which feels more like an authorial thesis than a character's organic thought in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's motivation shifts from professional duty to personal connection, which is a clear and compelling arc. However, the interiority relies on abstract, diagnostic labels ("suffocating accumulation of despair," "condensed emotional luminescence") rather than embodied emotion. The pivotal change is articulated in overly thematic terms ("What was needed wasn’t closure, but connection"), feeling more like an authorial summary than an organic character epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the central contradiction between his methodical nature and the surrender required for healing is well-drawn. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language ("self-blame dissolved," "heart's surface tension") that feels more like a summary of healing than an embodied experience, slightly undercutting the raw emotional state established elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is fierce, clear, and earned through the concise backstory of the confidence man. Her interiority is well-embodied, particularly the core contradiction of "cautious exuberance," which is shown through her steady hands despite a racing heart. Every action, from timing the pulses to documenting them, is driven by her singular goal, demonstrating a strong link between motive and choice. The final stance is earned by the prior causality of her meticulous work.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict—weighing a dream against an empire—is established effectively. The final choice to relinquish the violin is a strong act of renunciation, showing a credible hierarchy of values. However, some interiority, like "Perforated destiny wasn’t fate broken, but choice splintered," reads more like a diagnostic thesis than an embodied thought process in a moment of crisis, slightly flattening the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and her professionalism provides a compelling contrast to the grief-laden, cosmic stakes. Her interiority is focused and specific, particularly in the shift from trembling fingers to surgical precision, which embodies her conflict between urgency and skill. The characterization is powerful because her actions directly reflect her core values, culminating in an earned moment of renunciation and endurance that carries the full weight of her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is well-rendered, particularly through her connection to the hairpin. The core internal conflict between her act of forgiveness and her lingering lack of contentment is compelling. However, the final epiphany, while earned, is articulated with a degree of diagnostic clarity ("contentment wasn’t a destination but the act of tending") that feels slightly too neat and intellectualized for a moment of profound realization, softening its emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and the internal conflict between professional performance and personal hollowness is compelling. The motivation for change is well-established through the memory of Mrs. Gable. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language ("sincerely insincere," "unhooking others from their convictions"), which slightly undermines the feeling of a genuine crisis in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are perfectly aligned with it. Kael's arc from frustration to comprehension is believable. The primary weakness is a slight lack of internal contradiction in Elara; her interiority sometimes reads as a summary of her philosophical intent ("her motivation clear: to teach vanishing to appear") rather than a mind experiencing the moment, which softens the edge of an otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from skimming stones to appraising the starlings. The final state of "weathered resolve" feels earned by the preceding decades of seeking. However, the interiority, while poetically rendered, lacks significant contradiction; the skimmer reads as an almost perfect mystic vessel for wisdom, which slightly flattens his individuality under the weight of his symbolic role.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in her past obsolescence and her grandmother's philosophy. The shift from "underachieving mage" to "witness" feels earned by her actions, particularly the renunciation symbolized by dropping her pack. However, some interiority verges on diagnostic self-awareness ("she didn't feel like an underachieving mage but a witness"), which slightly flattens the emotional complexity of the moment by stating the change rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his synesthesia. His actions are consistent with his quest for knowledge, and his interiority is specific, especially in his sensory perceptions. However, the final emotional shift to carrying "the color of courage" feels slightly declared rather than fully embodied, a neat summary of a complex internal event that could have been rendered with more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between "quiet enthusiasm" for her methods and "stellar doubt" is well-maintained. The character arc from doubt to certainty is earned through her actions at the climax. The contradiction is present and the final shift to resolve feels authentic, avoiding unearned epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, rooting her professional identity as a reaper in her personal, shattering grief. The internal conflict between her duty and her love is palpable. The final shift from an "abyss" to a "space where light could gather" is earned through the ritual, representing a credible change in her relationship with her grief rather than a simplistic cure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    Aris's characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction: his "lukewarm" ability versus his "brittle devotion." His motivation is clear and consistently expressed through action—not grand spells, but the meticulous, humble work of measuring drips. The story masterfully embodies his emotions, such as clutching the bell "like a dead child," which grounds the high-concept stakes in tangible grief and care. The resolution, a quiet and temporary success, perfectly aligns with his established limits, making his earned endurance both credible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her progression feels earned, but the expression of her interiority occasionally relies on summary rather than embodiment. The final paragraphs shift into diagnostic label-speak ("understood his silence, his precisely humane refusal..."), which articulates the emotional state rather than letting the reader experience it through her perception, slightly weakening an otherwise strong character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict between logic and intuition is well-dramatized and consistent. The motivation is singular and clear, and her change is earned through the story's central event. The use of the sentimental locket as a physical anchor for her intuitive side is effective, preventing the conflict from feeling too abstract. However, some interiority verges on diagnostic self-awareness ("she’d dismissed intuition as weakness"), which slightly lessens the feeling of immediate, embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority suffers from being overly articulate and analytical during high-stakes moments. Lines like "they were midwives to trust, easing its birth in darkness" read more like authorial thesis than a character's thought under pressure. Her competence is so pronounced ("fingers danced," "inventively precise") that the internal struggle feels more conceptual than visceral, slightly undermining the tension of her burden.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    Aris's motivation to defeat his numbness is clear and consistent, driving the central action. The final shift to feeling joy is a strong beat, but the interiority becomes slightly diagnostic in the last few paragraphs, summarizing the change ("defeating numbness required connection, not control") rather than letting the embodied experience of "shared vulnerability" carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear but functions more as a thematic label than a deeply felt drive. His interiority is overly structured and articulate, as seen in the "First, botanically... second, metaphorically..." sequence, which reads like an outline rather than a natural thought process. There is a lack of genuine internal contradiction, making Elias feel more like a vehicle for the story's concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply embodied. The central contradiction of her character—a grief-stricken mother acting as a powerful, almost magical conductor—is sustained beautifully. Her internal state is rendered through potent physical actions, like her "knuckles white" on the pull cord, effectively linking emotion to choice. The final easing of tension in her shoulders provides a subtle but earned character change, reflecting the story's nuanced resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s internal conflict—the rigid guardian’s fear versus the longing to accept uncertainty—is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion. The shift in her motivation is well-earned, prompted by seeing her own fear mirrored in the cultist's vision. The final earned stasis feels credible, though the epiphany is articulated slightly too explicitly, bordering on diagnostic summary ("To make friends with uncertainty wasn’t surrender, but trust..."), which momentarily lessens the impact of the dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction of "stoically sensitive" is masterfully shown, not just told, particularly in the climax where his near-despair is stilled not by logic but by the weight of his purpose, and his final tears freeze before falling. The internal motivation to "interrupt the stifling destiny" is palpable and drives every action, culminating in an earned change from hopeless to hopeful.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives her high-stakes actions. The character is defined by a core philosophical belief which is tested and validated through a specific, earned choice—discarding the assumption that static is noise. Her interiority is strong, though a few phrases lean towards articulating the theme rather than embodying it in the moment, which narrowly keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo's motivation is strong and his actions are decisive, but his defining trait "resiliently positive" is more stated than dramatized. The interiority is functional but relies on direct statements of emotion ("hands trembled not from fear but urgency") rather than revealing deeper, contradictory impulses under pressure. The character reads as a highly competent archetype, which serves the plot well but lacks a layer of particularity or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her professional competence creates a compelling contrast with her emotional blind spot. The shift from a detached architect seeking to "map" connection to someone who must "receive the tension" is a powerful and earned change. Her internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her steady hands and hammering pulse, culminating in a choice that redefines her entire craft.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and embodied. The concept of "balanced curiosity" is not just stated but demonstrated through his synthesis of the anchor chain (the past) and the alien data (the future). The micro-choice of having Kael hold the chain creates a perfect crucible for his philosophy, and the final crystallization of his motivation feels earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is well-established and consistent, rooted effectively in her backstory. Her actions follow logically from her stated goal of listening to vulnerable voices. However, the character's interiority occasionally slips into summary, particularly in the final paragraph which labels her arc ("she’d turned incidental curiosity into salvation") rather than letting the final actions carry the emotional weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arden’s motivation is compelling and her defining internal conflict—professional competence versus debilitating claustrophobia—is dramatized effectively, especially during the climactic escape. The final shift from “spelunker” to “keeper of echoes” is earned through her ordeal. The characterization is strong, with embodied emotion and a clear hierarchy of values revealed under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from counting her heartbeats to using the shard. The internal conflict between her fragile, negated existence and her defiant quest for meaning is well-realized. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated interiority, such as "Her motivation was clear," which tells the reader what is already evident through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation as the last storyteller is established immediately and drives every action with conviction. His interiority is efficiently conveyed through his intense focus on sensory detail, particularly the texture of the bone, which aligns perfectly with his goal. The final shift from seeking an external record to possessing an internal "sonic imprint" is an earned and resonant change, representing a credible renunciation of his initial method while affirming his core mission.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, evolving from research-driven bitterness to a desire for transcendence. The internal conflict is clear, and her final choice to metamorphose feels like a genuine culmination of her search. A minor weakness is the slight over-articulation of the emotional shift with phrases like "bitterness transmuting into absurd, weightless joy," which veers toward diagnostic summary rather than purely embodied experience in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from “knowing” to “understanding” is earned through on-page action. The character’s interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly the transition from a hesitant signal to a commanding one. The final choice is a direct result of prior causality, and the cost of that choice is felt in the violent liberation of the statue, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized effectively through the memory of Elara's letter, directly fueling the high-stakes choice at the climax. The "respectfully rebellious" trait is not just stated but performed, with his calm demeanor contrasting his decisive, subversive action. The internal conflict and embodied emotion ("heart pounding," "hand trembled") feel authentic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his emotional arc from silent grief to expressive hope is well-defined. The character is embodied effectively in moments like the “tears tracking through the grime on his cheeks.” However, the interiority occasionally slips into over-articulated summary, as in "He understood instantly," or becomes a vehicle for thematic statements, slightly undermining the raw emotion of his climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait of "sanely eccentric" is dramatized effectively through her meticulous actions. The transformation from "seeker" to "guardian" provides a satisfying closure to her arc. However, the characterization lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; her focus is so unwavering that it feels slightly frictionless, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and sustained, rooted in the specific, tangible object of the palette. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, non-generic phrases like "a cipher of longing" and "a silent scream in pigment." The transition from obsessive stasis to decisive action is earned through a specific insight, making her final choice to leave feel both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation—her "improbable longing"—is clear and consistent, effectively driving the narrative's central action. However, her interiority remains almost entirely at the level of high-concept metaphor ("the hush of cosmic possibility flooding her veins"), making her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a uniquely realized individual. The core trait of "unassumingly bold" is well-dramatized in the climax, where she offers her longing rather than forcing the lock.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation is powerful and her final emotional change is earned and resonant. Her interiority is specific, blending scientific observation with folklore in a compelling way. The characterization is slightly weakened by a few overly declarative thematic statements, such as "when habits break, she’d learned, ghosts fester in the cracks," which feel more like authorial summary than an organic thought in a moment of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s central contradiction—her “combative tenderness”—is not just stated but dramatized effectively through the dual action of snapping at Kael while providing for him. Her internal state is masterfully embodied through physical tells like walking backwards, which pays off beautifully when she stops. Kael's role as a secondary pressure point who delivers the critical insight he learned from her is a tight, earned reversal that completes both their arcs in miniature.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her competence is well-established through specific details like "calloused fingers." However, her characterization lacks significant internal contradiction; she is portrayed as almost flawlessly resolute, with her sorrow serving more as fuel for her ritual than as a source of genuine, debilitating conflict that tests her resolve in a complex way.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, rooted in her grief and her profession as a metaphorical framework for her spirit. The internal conflict when confronting her brother's spirit is the story's emotional core and is executed with embodied feeling ("lucid unrest," "saltwater filling lungs"). A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward diagnostic summary, as seen in "the broken mask restorer momentarily whole in her purpose," which labels the emotional shift rather than letting the preceding action carry it entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara's characterization is superb, realized through her precise, professional actions. Her motivation—"to interpret silence with empathy"—is not just stated but dramatized through her methodical, non-invasive process. The concept of "shielded openness" is a brilliant piece of interiority, perfectly capturing the tension between scientific skepticism and a willingness to believe, which pays off in the final emotional release. The final choice is an act of restoration, not excavation, which is a perfect culmination of her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his analytical approach to grief is a strong character trait. However, the final change, while emotionally resonant, is predicated on an external discovery that feels too convenient. The epiphany is handed to him via the note, which slightly lessens the sense that he earned it through internal struggle alone.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear, and her arc from a silenced balladeer to a singer who bridges two worlds is earned and resonant. The internal conflict between her grief-induced silence and the ghost's plea for connection is compelling. However, interiority occasionally relies on summary, such as "Her motivation crystallized," which tells rather than embodies the shift, slightly undermining an otherwise strong and emotionally coherent character portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and her emotional progression is earned. The motivation is clear, but the realization, “this was the key, the very motivation that had sustained her,” reads as slightly too self-aware and summarizing for a moment of discovery. Her final change is credible, but the internal articulation of her core drive feels more like a thematic label applied retroactively than a deeply held, contradictory impulse shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in grief and professional obsession. Her final choice to prioritize documentation over survival is a powerful, earned expression of her values. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated interiority, such as "each word a stitch mending her grief," which feels more like a diagnostic summary than an embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her core limitation—face blindness—is masterfully transformed into a unique strength, her honed tactile sense. The internal conflict between desperate hope and physical exhaustion is embodied, culminating in an earned renunciation of perfection. The final moment of acceptance feels like a credible character shift, not a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, driving her actions in a believable chain of discovery. Her interiority effectively conveys a shift from "sociable isolation" to purposeful solitude, an earned change. However, the characterization remains slightly archetypal, and the final emotional state is articulated with a neatness ("sociable isolation now sweet with purpose") that feels more summarized than fully embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is superb—specific, profound, and directly tested by the central conflict. The internal conflict, anchored by the recurring "driftwood nostalgia," provides a strong emotional core that is satisfyingly reconfigured, not erased, by the resolution. Her final action is a perfect culmination of her desire "to learn the rhythm of repair," making the character change feel both earned and inevitable. The characterization is flawless through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot from inciting incident to climax. The secondary characters, Anya and Renn, provide a concise and believable crucible of skepticism versus faith, forcing a key decision. While the characterization is highly effective for this length, a deeper on-page rendering of Kael’s internal contradictions beyond despair vs. hope would be needed to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is powerful and deeply integrated, stemming from a specific past failure that gives the cosmic stakes a sharp, personal edge. The interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly the physical cost of the climax ("wrenched at his bones, aging him decades in seconds"). The final transformation into a "beautifully flawed" guardian is earned by the preceding struggle, providing a satisfying and costly character resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, rooted in the grim necessity of her oath. Her internal state is effectively shown through her "offhandedly exact" actions and the final tremor of her hands, which nicely embodies the conflict between practiced duty and its emotional weight. The final shift towards hope is earned, though the internal contradiction could have been layered more deeply throughout the central action rather than crystallizing mostly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is a significant strength, brilliantly filtering his grief through the specific lens of a polymer chemist. Phrases like "Grief had tightened like cross-linked polymers" are excellent. However, the character’s self-awareness occasionally becomes too diagnostic, with insights articulated in overly tidy, summary-like statements ("his grief’s rigidity betrayed life’s fluid truth") that feel less like an emotional process and more like a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the internal conflict between her profession and her core desire is potent. The shift from believing in erasure to understanding the necessity of absence is earned through the scene's logic. The epiphany feels slightly accelerated but remains grounded by her interaction with the specific environment, avoiding the trap of being a purely abstract realization.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her professional identity as a chef provides a unique, concrete lens for her interiority. The change from seeking to "sandpaper" a memory to transforming it is earned through the story's central trial. The score is held back from the 9+ band by minor instances of over-articulated self-awareness, such as "Her motivation crystallized," which slightly flatten the character's internal discovery into a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliska’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique profession. Her interiority is specific, filtering the world through sound and harmony. The trait "empathetically decisive" is stated as a label but then immediately dramatized, justifying its inclusion. The characterization is strong, though a slight tendency toward declarative statements of her internal state ("her resolve as firm as the tower’s stone") prevents it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and his internal transformation is earned with a legible emotional cost. Aris's actions are consistent with his "engineer" persona, particularly the "chaotically precise" methodology. The characterization relies slightly on high-concept labels but the emotional arc from "crumbling to dust" to a "steady hum of purpose" is compelling and well-executed, though capped by the Q7 artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative forward effectively. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction; she is highly competent and overcomes the central challenge without any major struggle or difficult trade-off. The final transformation into "harbinger of the blaze" feels more like an acceptance of a new title than a deeply earned internal shift resulting from a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, with interiority that is both specific and embodied (e.g., the final tears of relief). The character feels like a genuine artist with a distinct worldview. A minor deduction is for moments of over-articulated self-awareness, like "This is empathy in motion," which feel slightly more like thematic labels than organic, in-the-moment thought, briefly thinning the otherwise concrete interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, moving beyond simple redemption to a more nuanced search for beauty. His defining trait, "thoughtfully precise," is demonstrated through specific actions like aligning the board and his shadow. The final emotional shift feels earned, though the line "A tear traced his cheek, but he smiled" is a touch too performed for a story of this caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her defining trait as a mender is well-established. However, her interiority sometimes feels overly articulated and performative, as with the "theatrical sincerity" aside. The final epiphany is mostly earned, but the concluding thought to "heal the world" feels like a sudden, unearned leap in scale from a personal, profound realization to a generic messianic mission.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" is clear and consistently drives the narrative. The internal conflict between imposing control and yielding to natural harmony is well-defined. However, the pivotal epiphany, while thematically sound, feels more articulated than embodied; the line "Serenity wasn’t imposed stillness; it was the calm found *within* the sway" reads as a diagnostic summary rather than a raw, character-specific realization in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is a competent and effective protagonist, and her motivation is clear. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction or flaw; she reads more as a highly skilled observer than a character wrestling with a difficult internal state. The story's focus is on the discovery, leaving her characterization functional but without the depth that would make her truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and economical. Elara’s motivation is rooted in professional duty, but the discovery of the engineer's patch provides a potent emotional anchor, grounding her abstract goal in human cost. Her interiority, a blend of technical jargon and intuitive "reading" of disaster, is specific and credible. The moment she dives from the shifting container demonstrates her competence under pressure, reinforcing her stated trait of rapidly adapting.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael is a functional vessel for the story's concept, with a clear motivation. However, he lacks interiority beyond a stated calmness and purpose; there is no internal conflict, contradiction, or flaw that complicates his task. His synesthesia is more of a label than an embodied experience, and he reads as an archetypal performer rather than a specific individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, with her past failure providing a compelling engine for her present actions. The final internal shift from command to surrender is earned by the on‑page failure of her attempt. However, the articulation of her epiphany verges on being too diagnostic, slightly flattening the emotional complexity of the moment into a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.5)
    Aris’s motivation—to quantify emotion as a defense mechanism—is established with piercing specificity and drives every action. The internal conflict between the analytical impulse and the overwhelming flood of feeling is dramatized, not summarized. The final choice to renounce the quest for a formula is an earned, costly change, perfectly encapsulated in the shift from a desire “to solve” to a willingness “to carry.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kael's motivation—a blend of fear, grief, and duty—is established immediately and provides clear pressure for his choices. The internal conflict is embodied, not summarized, with his "jittery" state giving way to a deliberate, costly micro-choice to kneel. The final shift from fear to "quiet resolve" is earned through the climax, fulfilling the 9+ test of a choice with visible cost (the sharp sorrow of Vanya's absence).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is ironclad, and her internal journey from rigid certainty to humble acceptance is earned through on-page struggle. The climactic shift is rooted in a core, character-defining flaw—her need for control—which makes the final renunciation of her old methodology feel both devastating and inevitable. Her emotions are well-embodied, particularly the physical response to her shattering realization.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is singular and powerfully sustained, escalating from worn-thin duty to ultimate sacrifice. Her interiority is well-embodied, particularly the shift from the "hollow ache where purpose once resided" to the decisive, trembling action of fitting the puzzle pieces. The final choice to weave her own essence is an earned culmination of her decades of longing, satisfying the 9+ test for a choice earned by prior causality with a visible, ultimate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s characterization is strong and consistent, with his core trait of meekness becoming the literal, tangible price for the climax. The internal conflict is clear and the final change is earned through his deliberate actions. The interiority becomes slightly declarative at the end ("His meekness was gone, replaced by..."), which slightly undermines the otherwise excellent embodiment of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her identity as a "sensory map maker" directly informs her actions, creating a tight fusion of character and method. The internal conflict between needing to know a truth that might be betrayal or sacrifice is embodied and powerful. The final shift from seeking knowledge to carrying a legacy is an earned, resonant change with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation that is both deeply internalized and clearly dramatized. Her shift from observer to active guardian is seamless, driven by a specific, embodied interiority ("luminescent ache settled in her chest"). The final choice to build the cairns is a perfect synthesis of her reticent nature and crystallized purpose, earned through prior beats with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal arc from rigid perfectionism to embracing functional chaos is earned and compelling. The contradictory impulses of focused duty and encroaching doubt are dramatized effectively in scene. The final shift in her emotional state feels authentic, though the repeated phrase "shadowed elation" is a minor crutch in an otherwise specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-rendered. The final shift in her purpose is earned by the story's central action. However, the epiphany feels slightly too neat, and her final line to the child ("By holding the light gently...") verges on articulating a tidy moral rather than embodying her new, quieter state.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation is clear and potent, rooted in specific grief (wife's disappearance) and embodied suffering (psoriasis). His interiority is unique with the "quantified sorrow" ledger, creating a compelling contradiction between his methodical nature and the mystical world he inhabits. The final shift from seeking an answer to accepting a connection is an earned and meaningful change, though his immediate acceptance of the new paradigm feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is visceral and clear, and her arc from “scattered” to “whole” is earned through a specific, character-rooted discovery. The internal conflict between despair and fragile hope is well-dramatized. While the interiority is strong, a few moments rely on slightly familiar phrasing like "Panic, cold and sharp," which keeps it just shy of a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's core contradiction—a compassionate empath who fears connection—is well-established and embodied. Her motivation to rectify the "mistake of believing isolation was safety" is clear and compelling. The final choice feels earned, though some of the interiority ("a quiet, desperate need to unearth wisdom in a mistake") verges on being overly diagnostic, slightly undermining the raw emotion of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, rooted in guilt and a tangible connection to the past via the bread. Her internal conflict between despair and the drive to nurture life is compelling and resolved with a subtle, earned shift. The characterization is slightly weakened by the repetition of overly-articulated internal states, such as "tenuous absolution," which can read more like an authorial label than an organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, "gently meticulous," is dramatized through her actions, not just stated. The contrast between her trembling fingers and the source of the tremor—the weight of her task, not the cold—is a moment of excellent embodied interiority. The brief reflection on her predecessor's failure provides sharp, personal stakes that make her careful choices feel earned and fraught with tension. The final shift from dutiful preserver to a bearer of hope is a subtle but resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted effectively in her father's memory. Her interiority is concrete, though weakened by the repetitive use of the phrase "curiously steadfast," which functions more as an authorial label than an earned, embodied trait. While her resolve is shown through her persistence, the repetition of this specific descriptor slightly flattens the character's internal voice and creates a telling-not-showing artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's characterization is exceptional. Her core conflict as a "luminous skeptic" is dramatized effectively, shown in her dismissal of her grandmother's wisdom versus her desperate reliance on the ring. Her motivation is clear and her final conceptual shift is earned by the overwhelming evidence of the scene, providing a credible and powerful arc with a felt cost—the loss of her prior scientific certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is very strong, with motivation and internal conflict clearly externalized in the struggle with the lock. The change is earned. However, a few moments of over-articulated interiority, such as "the truth she’d buried" or "could she fix what was fractured within herself?", slightly undercut the otherwise excellent embodied emotion by summarizing her state too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her unique trait is used effectively to drive the plot forward. The internal conflict is demonstrated through her choice to speak vulnerable truths despite her fear, which feels earned. The interaction with Ben is slightly functional, serving primarily to trigger her epiphany, but it works efficiently within the compressed timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the story's single-minded action. Her interiority is revealed through precise, embodied actions ("Her hands remembered what her voice would soon forget"). The main weakness is the explicit statement of her drive ("Elara's motivation was simple, profound..."), which feels more like an authorial label than an organic character impulse, preventing the score from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in the contradiction between his design and his "flaw" of nostalgia. His interiority is concrete, especially the translation of grief into "static." The final choice is earned, but the concluding thought, "Nostalgia wasn’t a flaw—it was the compass that guided him home," is a slightly too-articulate diagnostic label that lessens the impact of the preceding embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear but lacks compelling internal conflict; she functions more as an archetypal facilitator of community healing than a complex individual. The secondary characters are well-differentiated but serve primarily as exposition-delivery mechanisms, neatly providing their "thread to the tapestry." The characterization is functional and serves the fable-like plot, but avoids the messy, contradictory interiority expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and defining trait—the lyrical code breaker—are clearly established and consistently dramatized. Her interiority demonstrates a compelling contradiction between the external threat and her internal resolve, effectively showing "calm defiance" rather than just stating it. The character is slightly weakened by a tendency to possess perfect, diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis, with insights articulated in the tidy language of a thematic summary rather than the fragmented perception of someone in a flooding lab.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s motivation is sharp and poignantly rooted in grief, driving the narrative effectively. His interiority is well-rendered, particularly the connection between the physical pull of gravity pockets and the "hollow ache" of memory loss. The final choice to release the memories is earned through the discovery of his mother's journal, making his change from wanting to reclaim to wanting to set free feel credible. A slight deduction for moments where emotion is stated rather than fully embodied, such as "His motivation sharpened like a whetstone."

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are exceptionally clear, and her actions are seamlessly aligned with her role. However, the characterization lacks the internal contradiction or flaw that would elevate it further; her interiority is one of resolute focus rather than struggle, making her more of an archetypal vessel for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, and her internal conflict between a desperate need for literal meaning and the dawning awareness of a metaphorical one is beautifully rendered. The shift is earned, catalyzed by Mrs. Thorne’s gentle but pointed observations. The line "Interrogate—that was exactly how Vale described her approach" is a powerful, character-defining beat that feels completely authentic and triggers the final, costly change in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic labels ("fractured psyche," "transmuting agony into measurable vibrations") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The "charmed skeptic" trait is stated but not dramatized; she shows no skepticism in scene, which flattens the internal conflict into a procedural success story instead of a struggle against her own disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elara’s motivation is rooted in generational duty, and her internal conflict—the tension between practiced skill and the immense pressure of her task—is perfectly embodied in the single moment her hand trembles. The final emotional shift, from a heavy weight to a burden “transformed,” is earned by the climactic action, showing a profound and credible change in her relationship to her legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaela’s motivation is intensely clear and personal, rooted effectively in her brother's fate. Her interiority is vivid, though occasionally relies on ornate phrasing like "reed-blown melancholy" that feels slightly performed rather than fully embodied. The final decision to sing is a powerful, character-driven choice that aligns perfectly with her established goals and the new information she's gained.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation to “salvage something pure” is compelling and provides a strong throughline. Her interiority is concrete, and her emotional arc culminates in the embodied response of “Tears froze on Elara’s cheeks,” which feels earned. The final choice to place the globe in the shrine is a perfect physical expression of her internal resolution, demonstrating a meaningful change with a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kenji’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are a perfect embodiment of his “net-mender philosopher” identity. The interiority is specific, linking his craft to his worldview without cliché. The micro-choice of the “demure audacity” in his whistle is a masterful character moment, revealing a quiet certainty earned through experience. The final act of a ritual tea ceremony is a deeply resonant and earned culmination of his character arc within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena's motivation is established with laudable efficiency and her actions are consistently driven by it. The characterization is sharp and functional, particularly the way her professional skepticism ("curses were tools") directly enables her progress. The final beats land an emotional shift from investigator to bearer of a terrible burden, which feels earned. However, the story lacks a moment of genuine internal contradiction in-scene; her path is one of linear, competent discovery rather than a struggle against a competing impulse or flaw, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies effectively, culminating in a credible shift from passive archivist to active saboteur. The internal conflict is well-established by the shattering of her faith in the Prophet. However, a single line of summary, "Gritty determination hardened her whimsy," feels like an authorial label that slightly undermines the otherwise well-embodied transition.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between isolation and a desire for connection is well-dramatized. The emotional reaction to the music box feels earned and specific, avoiding cliché. The final shift in his purpose is a credible evolution, earned by the scene with the child, showcasing a meaningful change with the felt cost of his prior loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation is fierce and clear, and his defining trait—being “logically emotional”—is demonstrated effectively during the climax. He both calculates the necessary frequency and feels the Tower's pain, creating a compelling synthesis of skill and empathy. The characterization is strong, but slightly undercut by the explicit labeling of his internal state rather than allowing it to emerge purely from his actions and perceptions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The central conflict is effectively externalized in the confrontation with the impatient young man, providing a crucible for her philosophy. While her interiority is thematically resonant, it occasionally veers into overly articulate self-analysis, stating the theme directly rather than purely embodying it. Her final action and reflection demonstrate an earned change, fulfilling the story's arc with conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between compliance and integrity is dramatized effectively through backstory fragments that feel earned. The final shift from vulnerability to being "armored" by her legacy provides a compelling and credible arc, with the cost of her decision felt clearly. The motivation crystallizes believably under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Father Michael's internal conflict between guilt and duty is palpable, and his arc toward accepting his own need for peace is earned and moving. His motivation is clear and deepens powerfully at the climax. Mrs. Gable, while brief, is a sharp and effective catalyst, her dialogue revealing a worldview that challenges and ultimately aids the chaplain. The final shift is not just an epiphany but an embodied change in stance, flawlessly executed in the last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zephyr's characterization is exceptional, driven by a consistent and compelling motivation—a "steadily curious nature" that is dramatized rather than just stated. The blend of pragmatic inventor and philosophical seeker is beautifully realized through both action and interiority. The final choice to "transcend calculation" is a perfectly earned culmination of the internal conflict between methodical craft and abstract yearning, making the climax feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and powerfully sustained, driving every choice. Her key actions, particularly the lies to Vance, reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The shift in motivation from "finding" to "rescuing" is an effective internal turn. However, some interiority relies on stock phrasing (e.g., "her focus laser-bright," "heart pounded"), which slightly genericizes moments of high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, but their characterization relies on labels like "calmly intuitive" rather than embodied internal conflict. They function more as a competent, idealized plot-mover than a character with contradictory impulses. The emotional weight falls on Kael, whose brief arc from grief to shame is potent but leaves the protagonist feeling somewhat remote.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves with psychological realism. The shift from seeking an end to seeking to understand endings is earned through the story's central events, not asserted. The internal conflict is consistently embodied, particularly in the tension between her patient trawling and the "fold in patience," culminating in a credible, resonant change of perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her motivation to understand her loneliness is clear. However, her self-awareness occasionally becomes too diagnostic, stepping out of embodied emotion into abstract analysis. The line, "To nurture intersubjective understanding, she told herself... this was her vigil’s deeper purpose," reads more like an author's thesis statement than a character's organic thought mid-scene, slightly undermining the otherwise earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is very strong; Elara's motivation as a "line walker" is clear and her actions are consistent. Her core trait of being "strangely honest" is effectively dramatized, becoming the mechanism for her success when she feels the parapet's weariness. The final exhaustion is a well-earned, embodied cost, though the explicit statement "her strangely honest nature was not a choice but a burden" borders on diagnostic summary just before it's shown.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is strong and specific, driven by a well-integrated backstory that motivates her present actions without overwhelming the scene. Her primary trait, a quiet determination, is demonstrated through her micro-choices, particularly the powerful act of giving her own photo to Leo. A slight deduction is for moments where her interiority verges on thematic summary, such as "her life’s work to transmute suffering into a masterpiece," which states the story's thesis a bit too directly for this caliber of work.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is generally well-realized through her focused actions, but occasionally dips into abstract summary. The line "her weathered innocence—a lifetime of trusting books to hold answers despite their obsolescence" is a significant instance of telling an abstract trait rather than embodying it in the moment, which slightly undermines an otherwise strong character portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central contradiction of being "precognitively forgetful" is not merely stated but fully dramatized through Silas's actions and internal state. His motivation—to capture the sound of growing older—is specific, poignant, and drives every choice, culminating in a final renunciation forced by his condition, with the cost of his lost discovery made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aris's motivation is powerfully established, rooted in a specific, embodied grief that drives his professional obsession. The internal conflict between fighting transience and accepting it is palpable, culminating in a credible change of stance. His final actions are a direct, earned result of his internal shift, foreclosing his prior path of resistance with the felt cost of accepting his "luminous ache" as a companion, not an enemy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and drives every action. Her interiority is specific, particularly in her professional focus on crafting a peaceful end. The characterization is strong, but occasionally dips into slightly overwrought descriptions like "her presence a calm harbor in the storm of endings," which reads more as authorial summary than embodied character perception in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, linking a personal ache for her mentor to planetary stakes, which powerfully drives the narrative. Her change is earned through meticulous, on-page effort, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of her grief. However, her interiority reads as slightly too controlled under pressure; the story states she is “quietly deliberate” and her actions align, but it misses an opportunity to dramatize a moment of internal conflict or doubt, which would elevate the characterization from highly competent to deeply human.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to reframe her trauma is clear and earned, evolving believably from her son’s innocent questions and the bone setter’s wisdom. The internal conflict between her past skepticism and her new reality is palpable. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly polished, diagnostic phrasing, such as when her motivation "crystallized as she traced the tooth’s smooth curve: to turn mistakes into constellations." This reads more like a thesis statement than a raw, in-the-moment realization, slightly thinning the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a deeply felt and consistent motivation rooted in grief and purpose. Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied, particularly in the contrast between her past dreams of "orbiting observatories" and her present, tactile mission. The final emotional shift from "grounded" to "aloft" is earned through the story's accumulated weight of memory and action, satisfying the highest standards for a character arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to reframe her trauma is clear and consistent, culminating in an earned character choice. Her interiority is specific, though it occasionally leans on over-articulated metaphors. The internal conflict between hiding and connecting is well-dramatized in the final beat with Mara, where the action of proffering the pendant feels like a genuine, costly step forward.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias's motivation as a novelist seeking closure is deeply integrated and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict between preservation and acceptance is dramatized effectively, culminating in an earned character change. The line stating "This was the core of his conflict" verges on being slightly too diagnostic, but it's a minor point in an otherwise masterful portrayal of a specific internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are consistent with her role as a tinkerer trying to mend a spiritual wound. The moment of panic is well-embodied and drives the climax. However, her characterization as "whimsical" feels like an unearned label, as her actions in the scene are driven by desperation and deep reverence, not whimsy. The internal conflict is present but resolves a bit too cleanly once the solution presents itself.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is the unwavering engine of the narrative, moving from a clear desire (preserving Lina's memory) to a culminating act of fulfillment. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, grounding abstract concepts like "safekept starlight" in the specific, embodied grief for her granddaughter. The final action is not just a success, but an earned stasis, a quiet smile that resolves her long, patient struggle with a deeply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and fully integrated. Elara’s motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" is not just a label but the direct driver of her precise, observational actions. The concept of "peripheral focus" is brilliantly dramatized as her core problem-solving method, aligning her internal state with the external plot. The final beat, where "Tears pricked her eyes, but her hands stayed steady," perfectly embodies contradictory impulses under pressure, earning the story's resolution without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and her internal conflict—the “fractal weaver’s curse”—provides a strong thematic anchor. The character is revealed through her precise, ritualistic actions rather than extensive reflection. The final shift to a faint smile signifies an earned stasis, but the curse itself feels slightly more like a stated concept than a contradictory impulse fully dramatized in a moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is lucid and her emotional progression feels authentic, moving from a static state of grief to active engagement. The internal conflict is clear, though it leans towards summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The primary weakness is a tendency toward over-articulated self-awareness, as seen in "Her motivation burned clear," which reads more like an authorial note than a character's internal voice mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict between past hope and present erosion is well-drawn. The character’s resolve is demonstrated through her deliberate actions. However, the interiority occasionally relies on high-register summary ("Her motivation was raw and singular") which creates a slight distance, rather than fully embodying the emotion in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her defined trait of being "functionally creative." Her interiority is effective, particularly the moment of "stoic wonder" rather than simple triumph, which adds depth. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of self-diagnosis, such as when she consciously maintains her "engineer’s composure," which feels more like a label than an embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his introverted perfectionism and the weight of a past failure. His internal conflict is well-dramatized through the contrast between his precise, gentle actions and the vast, un-striving presence of the bear. The final change is earned, though the epiphany is articulated with a clarity that verges on diagnostic self-awareness ("Peace, he realized..."), slightly lessening the embodiment of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation and transformation are compelling and well-earned. The shift from a seeker of magic to a dissector of fraud is clear and psychologically credible. However, her internal process sometimes relies on summary labels like "hindsight clarity flooded her," which feel slightly less embodied than the rest of her experience, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his interiority is well-rendered through concrete details. However, his characterization lacks complexity; he exhibits no internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. His unwavering patience and dedication, while fitting the theme, make him feel more like a noble archetype than a flawed individual, which prevents the characterization from reaching the highest tier of literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear, potent motivation to map and understand grief. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific actions—the tracing of the leaf, the focus on the thread—that avoid generic emotional summary. The internal conflict culminates in an earned shift in perspective, where her understanding of healing evolves through the act of witnessing Varek's loss, fulfilling the 9+ quick test as her contradictory impulses resolve into a new, earned stance with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is intensely clear and his actions are a direct embodiment of it. The internal conflict between his idealized hope and the eventual flawed reality is earned, culminating in a powerful, character-altering acceptance. The final micro-choice—to hold rather than fix—is a perfect, earned expression of his change, showing a shift in his entire hierarchy of values with a visible cost: the death of his perfect dream for the birth of a difficult reality.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's core contradiction—arsonist's daughter as firefighter and guardian—is compelling and well-established. Her motivation for healing the land is clear and embodied in the act of grafting. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into overly diagnostic language, such as defining her forgiveness as something she "hadn't yet earned but practiced daily," which slightly undermines the raw emotion of the moment by over-articulating it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her defining traits—"luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative"—are stated as labels rather than demonstrated through conflicting impulses in scene. While her actions are consistent, the internal struggle of a skeptic forced to act on legend is summarized rather than embodied. The final shift to hope is earned by the plot, but the characterization itself lacks a deeper layer of contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a strong generational legacy. However, her core trait as a "sentimentalist" is more stated than dramatized through conflicting in-scene choices; her actions are competent and determined, but lack the specified internal friction. The emotional beats are present but lean on summary ("her heart aching") rather than being fully embodied in action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation and internal conflict—the stonemason's tangible craft versus the ephemeral nature of memory—are expertly rendered and embodied. His actions are driven by a believable and specific hierarchy of values, and the final emotional release is earned through the preceding struggle. The contradiction between his instinct to "carve into stone" and the living ritual he performs is the story's powerful core.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is a deeply integrated blend of professional duty and personal guilt, made concrete through the central action of carving. The internal conflict is shown, not told, as his meticulous nature is channeled into both his job and his private penance. The final shift from penance to promise is earned and lands with quiet power, fulfilling the 9+ test of a costly choice leading to a credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional for this length. The transition from a "blithe spirit" to someone bearing the "weight of understanding" is a complete and earned arc. Her core trait of "tenderly organized precision" is skillfully demonstrated in both gardening and decoding, making her competence at the climax feel inevitable and deeply rooted in her nature.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the compelling title of "ignorance cartographer." The internal conflict between the high risk of his model and the certainty of failure by inaction is well-established. However, the characterization relies heavily on exposition of his internal state and professional philosophy, rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses through action; the final resolve ("His hands didn't shake") feels slightly too clean, undercutting the immense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is clear and her past as a copyist provides a credible and specific skill set for her present mission. Her interiority is embodied effectively ("heart quickened"), and the final beat where she resolves to teach the dust about "crescendos" is a perfect, earned synthesis of her past and future, demonstrating a deep change with resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and powerfully rendered, with her internal conflict between acknowledging decay and seeking to preserve meaning driving the piece. Her interiority is concrete and specific, particularly in her connection to the porcelain mask. The final shift to clarity feels earned, though the articulation of her motives sometimes verges on being too explicit, slightly lessening the impact of her internal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Phil's motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and dramatized through action. The internal conflict between his meticulous, 'agonizing' work and his 'abrasive calm' under pressure is well-realized. The climactic choice to present evidence rather than engage in a power struggle is a perfect expression of his 'rationally rebellious' character, and the contradictory impulses (intellectual passion vs. cold logic) act simultaneously in the scene. Kael is a functional antagonist, though slightly one-dimensional, effectively providing the necessary pressure to reveal Phil's core values.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ms. Thorne's motivation is clear and her internal state is well-rendered, particularly the shift from seeking refuge to creating it. The dramatization of the students' breakthrough—seeing pain instead of defiance, insecurity instead of accusation—is a moment of genuine insight. However, the repeated use of key phrases like "expectantly resigned" acts as a label rather than an evolving character trait, slightly flattening the nuance of her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistently dramatized and her interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail. The link between her actions and her resolve is strong. A minor weakness is the twice-stated self-assessment "informally wise," which reads as a diagnostic label rather than an earned trait demonstrated through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with her truth compulsion serving as an excellent engine for internal and external conflict. The motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. However, the articulation of her core value—"To remember there’s wonder *in* the routine"—borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the earned nuance of her struggle into a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is established early and drives her actions consistently. Her interiority is specific and her methods align with her character. The final epiphany feels earned by her process, but its articulation verges on over-explanation, slightly weakening the embodied nature of the change by summarizing it too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aelius’s motivation shifts credibly from sentinel to healer, driven by the ampoule’s revelations. The internal conflict—moving from a rigid belief in the Council’s malice to sorrowful understanding—is clear and powers the climax. The change is earned, though the epiphany, "To welcome nuance into a certainty, he realized, was the only path to healing," verges on being overly articulate rather than fully embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific: to capture the *texture* of a missed choice. This intellectualized goal is consistent with his character as a man of proofs, and his internal conflict between rational escape and experiential understanding is palpable. The final choice to turn back is a powerful, earned renunciation that crystallizes his character as a "grim optimist" without contradiction. The thought process is complex and avoids diagnostic self-awareness, showing his struggle rather than summarizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply rooted in his personal history, providing a strong emotional core. His interiority is well-rendered, particularly the mix of methodical hope and doubt. The final emotional shift to relief is earned, though the internal conflict could have been sharper; his doubt feels more like a passing cloud than a genuine threat to his conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is singular and powerfully rendered, shifting from "scholarly calm" to earned panic without contradiction. Her interiority is concrete, rooted in sensory detail and professional desperation. The final choice to act is a potent crystallization of her values, earned by the preceding pressure and demonstrating a clear hierarchy—preservation over protocol—with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from her profession to the climax. Her interiority is palpable in key moments like the "breath that felt like stepping off a cliff." However, her characterization is slightly subsumed by the story's powerful concept; she feels more like a perfect instrument for the theme than a person with complex, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is embodied through her physical state (hammering heart, tender ribs). The final choice feels earned, flowing from her established desperation and the paradoxical guidance she receives. However, some interiority verges on being too diagnostic, such as the neat summary: "Clara understood: to trick fear, she must offer it her deepest terror, then deny its power," which feels more like an authorial roadmap than a character's messy realization in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction; she functions more as a flawless executor of a mystical art than a person struggling with doubt or competing impulses. The interiority is rich with purpose but thin on personal flaw, making her feel more archetypal than individual, as seen in the unwavering execution of her "lifelong vow."

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and intensifies perfectly from a "low but constant" fire to a hardened resolve. The internal state is tied to the external world, with his quiet precision mirroring the city's unnatural silence. The final shift is earned by the on-page discovery, making his choice to confront the watchers feel like the only possible culmination of his character's established obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but the core trait "emotionally rational" is more stated than embodied. While her calm reassembling of papers offers a good "show" moment, the repeated label feels diagnostic, thinning the character's interior complexity slightly and preventing her from reaching the highest tier of individualization.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the shift from passive observation to active intervention. Her competence as a surveyor is well-established through specific actions and tools. However, her core trait of being "stoically sensitive" is stated as a label three times, which slightly undermines the otherwise effective embodiment of her quiet resolve and emotional depth; the characterization feels more asserted than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to "trace honest origins" is expertly demonstrated, not just stated. The internal conflict between her duty as an indexer and her emerging duty to the truth is resolved through a credible, earned decision. Her character is revealed through her methodical actions, making the final moment of "dappled resolve" feel like a natural culmination rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s internal conflict between passive sorrow (folding cranes) and active transformation (polishing the gem) is the story's engine. Her contradictory impulses are dramatized effectively, and the final shift from grief to hope feels earned through the crucible of the climax, making her choice to continue her work a powerful, character-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in a specific, devastating trauma. The internal conflict between grief and scientific purpose is well-dramatized, culminating in the final beat of "bleak exhilaration" where these contradictory impulses coexist powerfully. The character’s final shift from a desperate search to a defined mission is earned by the climax, representing a credible change with the cost of his loss still painfully visible.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her final change is earned, rooted in a well-established yearning. The character arc is clear and satisfying, moving from a disconnected seeker to an integrated participant in the cosmos. A slight deduction is for the commander's dialogue, which borders on articulating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge solely from Elara's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is potent and his internal conflict between past justification and present guilt is palpable. The final choice to renounce his former trade is earned through the story’s central discovery, and the cost is made tangible in the final beat as the watch hand bites his skin. Characterization is concise and powerful, meeting the highest standards for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in past failure. The internal arc is palpable, culminating in an earned change symbolized by the drawer pull. However, a few lines of interiority veer close to diagnostic self-awareness ("sought to recycle mistakes into wisdom"), slightly over-articulating the internal process rather than leaving it fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between escape and confrontation is well-dramatized. Leo’s emotions are embodied effectively, especially in the "merrily melancholic" moments of humming while tearing up. However, the recurring internal phrase "to align heart and action" reads as overly diagnostic and self-aware for a character in crisis, slightly undermining the otherwise organic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and his pivotal choice at the fork is well-grounded in his internal conflict. However, the characterization falters at the climax with diagnostic interiority like "he'd chosen empathy over expediency," which reads more like an authorial summary than the raw thought of a man in a high-stakes moment, slightly flattening the earned emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is a powerful, consistent engine for the narrative. Her internal conflict is palpable, caught between memory and a forced evolution. The final change feels earned, but the characterization is slightly weakened by the use of diagnostic language like "reluctant metamorphosis," which labels her internal state rather than purely embodying it in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are directly tied to her internal conflict. The contradiction between her professional identity and her maternal failure provides a strong foundation. The final change is earned through a difficult, embodied act, making the resolution feel credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, and her internal conflict—the pacifist forced into a cosmic confrontation with pain—is compelling. The shift from resisting shadows to welcoming them is an earned change. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic self-awareness, such as defining "shadow work" explicitly, which feels more like an author's note than a character's thought process in a high-stakes moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks sharp internal conflict. His interiority leans toward philosophical summary ("he’d yearned to grasp how change truly felt") rather than embodied struggle. He functions more as a thematic vessel for selfless generosity than a complex individual with contradictory impulses acting in the scene, which makes his final acceptance feel pre-ordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, directly fueling the plot. Her interiority is well-drawn, though the trait "calmly inventive" is stated more than it is dramatized as a struggle against the mentioned "panic." The backstory of her grandfather provides effective weight, but the execution of her primary action reads more like following a known procedure than inventing a solution under pressure, slightly flattening the character's internal challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between control and surrender is effectively dramatized. The final shift in his stance is earned by the story's central turn, and the cost of his new understanding feels genuine. The character arc from struggling herder to a herder of "moments of clarity" is well-executed, showing a meaningful change foreclosing his prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained. The internal conflict is well-embodied through the ritual of timing the storm, connecting external chaos to internal trauma. However, a few moments of interiority slip into diagnostic summary, slightly undermining the raw, in-the-moment experience, such as "Grief thinned to transparency, leaving only clarity," which labels the emotional shift rather than letting the preceding images do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but the interiority occasionally slips into self-aware summary. The line "This wasn't mere combat; it was a desperate method to survive long enough to decipher the sundial" reads more like a diagnostic label than an in-the-moment thought, slightly flattening the character's voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The internal conflict between the Scribe and Architect personas is a strong anchor, and the motivation rooted in Mateo's memory is clear and compelling. The character is well-realized through his connection to key objects and the setting. A slight deduction is made because the "monthly molt" feels more like a stated condition than a viscerally embodied process within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and her core identity as a pianist provides a compelling, non-obvious solution to her mechanical problem. The arc from “wistful” longing to “steely” resolve is earned through her actions. The repeated phrase “strategically creative” reads as a slightly too-explicit label for a trait that is otherwise demonstrated effectively through her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core internal conflict—empiricism versus magic—is well-defined. However, her characterization leans more towards fulfilling a role than embodying a complex individual; the resolution to her doubt feels slightly too swift once the physical proof appears. While her actions are consistent, the internal struggle is more stated than felt, particularly in the moments leading to the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kai's motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, driving the narrative with a powerful internal conflict between pride and regret. The final choice to reframe apology as an ongoing act is earned through his reflection on the bonsai metaphor ("Roots remember what branches forget"). The characterization is strong, though slightly weakened by moments of overly diagnostic interiority like "the liminal space between regret and release," which can pull the reader out of his immediate emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation to escape sensationalism and focus on gradual truths is clear and intensifies through her observations, compelling her final renunciation of forced narratives with a felt cost of humility; interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like seeking quiet amid ruin yet finding profound insight there. The realization in the greenhouse mirrors her traits as a researcher, with emotions layered contradictorily without therapy-speak. Flaws in perception drive her shift, but the single-POV scope limits relationship dynamics, keeping it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to discover purpose post-ambush is clear and rooted in her adaptive artist traits, compelling her tracking choices with embodied emotion like trembling fingers and heartbeat sync; interiority shows contradictory impulses in survival instinct versus deliberate reconstruction, earning the final renunciation of fear with felt cost in the bruise and near-death. However, some stock phrasing like "refusal to be silenced" edges toward therapy-speak, slightly diluting specificity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies through embodied frustration, culminating in her resonator choice that forecloses prior failures with emotional cost; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in her mimed gestures urging serenity amid chaos. The botanist's secondary pressure sharpens her arc without overwhelming the single-POV focus. Some emotional summary in reflections trends toward label-speak, but it anchors in present cues like the lily's petal.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's motivation to grant rest is clear and rooted in his stubborn, weary traits, intensifying to compel his descent and restoration; interiority is concrete with embodied exhaustion, like shoulders slumped from coffins, but internal conflict feels more summarized than simultaneous in key moments. The final endurance defers his own rest with felt cost, earning stasis through prior causality. Relationships and status are irrelevant as no second character appears on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to build intergenerational support is clear and intensifies through his persistent actions, culminating in the bell chime that reveals his values with felt cost; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the ache in his chest easing at closure. Relationships pressure choices, as seen in interactions with Marta and Lena, forcing endurance with visible trade-offs. Flaws like his sparing use of the bell show genuine struggle without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past-life guilt, intensifying through embodied trembling and breathing to compel the climactic release of love; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses of fear and curiosity shown in her hesitant handling of the tear. The final healing endures as Earned Stasis, foreclosing regret with felt cost of dissolving stagnant love, visible in the golden mist seeping into her skin. Strengths include character-specific flaws complicating choices without stereotypes, though secondary characters are absent, fitting single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation to harness time is clear and intensifies through regret, compelling his climactic grasp of the fragment; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and hammering heart, revealing contradictory impulses in his desperate crawl. The final renunciation of photographs earns stasis with visible cost of dissolved memories. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "heart hammered" prevents higher band, but flaws don't touch closure.

    Aris’s interior contradiction—hunger for quiet truth vs. career pressure for spectacle—is embodied in her tactile mapping of dust; the final renunciation of “needless drama” carries visible cost as she seals the vial and walks away from prior ambition. Micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, closing notebook) align with motive and foreclose the path of self-aggrandizing science. Reflection stays anchored in present cues and tilts her stance. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—trembling fingers, molten flux memory—yet the “purpose in the pauses” refrain edges toward label-speak. Her adaptive trait is dramatized when frost-reading shifts her from artist to tracker, but the ledger’s emotional weight is asserted more than felt. The final stance crystallizes with cost: her art weaponized, her safety foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—camera shutter tremor, chemical stains, marrow-memory of incense—but “spiritually curious ache” drifts toward label.

The micro-choice to grasp the fragment is credibly driven by prior causality and carries a visible cost: the erasure of his daughter’s image. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final renunciation—leaving the blank photo behind—earns its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s contradictions feel lived—her chains both prison and anchor, her patience versus the pounding wall. The embodied drive to plant seeds for a future she may never see powers every micro-choice with concrete stakes, culminating in a credible and costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsession with the “sound of trust breaking” is embodied in every micro-choice—adjusting coils, feeding metal, calibrating filters—so motive drives action without summary. The contradiction between her desire to capture absence and the cellular renewal around her sharpens the internal stakes. The final tear confirms cost, yet the moment edges toward performed epiphany rather than earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—grief vs. need for self-definition—play out in micro-choices (thermal trick, moonbeam jar). The final renunciation (she doesn’t steal, she listens) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “luminous disbelief” edges toward label-speak at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s grief-to-renewal arc is embodied through micro-choices (handling the bookmark, reheating glass) and contradictory impulses (performative cheer vs. private despair). Interiority is specific—his stage-voice narration externalizes coping—but the final abandonment decision feels slightly under-motivated; the console’s sudden rupture is external rather than a culmination of his flaw or choice. Still, the thawing heart motif is felt in body and action, not just label.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the grit on her cast, the seashell’s warmth—yet the “vulnerability is power” epiphany edges toward therapeutic summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The micro-choice to film the confession is earned, but the prior beat of decoding the cipher feels slightly convenient, blunting the flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s obsession with the booklet and her need to map silence are clear, embodied, and escalate to the final choice; the interior contradiction between clinging to light and embracing darkness is dramatized in the act of mapping absence. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Unit 7’s interiority is concrete and embodied—frost-dusted sensors, treads compressing snow without a whisper—yet the “remarkably composed” refrain drifts toward label. The contradictory impulse (frustration vs. patient observation) is dramatized across loops, culminating in the earned renunciation of further resets. Micro-choices (lifting the violin, bowing once) reveal a hierarchy of values, but the final beat could carry more visceral cost to breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s curiosity compels the final, pivotal act of transparency that reconfigures the musicians’ relationship and her own isolation; the change is earned and carries felt relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motive—gardens remember gardeners—drives every micro-choice: selecting flawed marbles, rejecting quantified “12%” luck, enduring stiff knees to place the final offering. Her interiority is granular and tactile (withered vines, cloth softened in sixty years of use), the body itself weathering under the theme. The single reversal—the forget-me-nots suddenly leaning toward her—rewards but does not rescue: the garden’s acknowledgment is earned, not bestowed. Cost is visible in her aging frame and in the lifelong commitment that now precludes any other end.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obliging nature and hidden ambition are embodied through tactile micro-choices (wiping frost, trembling at the lever). The final pull crystallizes her internal contradiction—duty vs. theory—at visible cost (tears freeze, circuits realign). Motivation is clear and escalates to the decisive act. Minor: the “obliging” trait is asserted more than tested in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession with the ghost and the code is clear and embodied—he wades, lifts, traces, tilts. Interiority stays tactile (“damp pages clinging to his chest like a second heartbeat”). Yet the moment of decision—choosing to carry the program out—arrives almost gift-wrapped; the cost of that choice is asserted rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is precise, embodied, and contradictory—her “swallowed truth” and “fault-tolerant lattice” collide in the smudge moment. The final integration of guilt as unweighable yet shaping every future forecast is earned and costly. Minor: the phrase “guilt had a tangible mass” flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is immediately undercut by the smudge’s refusal to quantify.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s skepticism and curiosity are embodied in tactile micro-choices (kneeling in cold muck, straining to lift the valve). The final shift from mockery to custodianship is earned by the radio confession and the valve’s weight; cost is the literal burden he shoulders at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “grip on reality” is dramatized through sensory hallucination and the swan’s folds. The vow to witness without judgment collides with her instinct to save the Codices, producing a credible renunciation that costs her the route to the vault. The contradiction is present but slightly underplayed; the moment of yielding could carry more visceral sting.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the curl as “wonder compass” anchors her motive without therapy-speak. The micro-choice to open the flute case slowly under Leo’s fear shows contradictory impulses (hope vs. caution) and costs her the safety of distance. Leo’s shift from terror to awe is credibly earned by the shared moment, not by exposition. Only the father remains a functional prop, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s solitary-archivist drive is lucid and consistent; her micro-choice to fuse Clara’s carbonized voice with the tapestry’s seismic song crystallizes her arc. Interiority stays concrete—sensor “whir,” filament manipulator—avoiding diagnostic label-speak. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the renunciation of silence carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning for escape yet clinging to sanctuary—surface in micro-choices (adjusting the wick, deciphering the microdot). The final shift from passive keeper to active orchestrator is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (exhaustion, new identity). Old Man Chen remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Anselm’s interiority is vivid—cassock vibration, indigo breath—but his contradictory impulses (faith vs. techno-ritual) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (collective belief over stone permanence) is earned by the looped probe, yet the cost feels collective rather than personal, softening the sting.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s internal contradiction is consistent—memories vs exhaustion—but the exhaustion price feels told rather than embodied; the final collapse lacks prior physical deterioration shown, so renunciation reads as graceful exit not earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—Kael’s urge to save vs. need to walk through his younger self—but the final “labyrinth is the path now” lands as epiphany rather than embodied cost; no new micro-choice after summit. Ghost selves are atmospheric, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s deafness is the hinge on which every sensory and emotional choice rests; her decision to try the broken needle backward is a fresh, credible risk that reconfigures her stakes on the page. The embodied tension between tactile vibration and remembered sound, plus the shared resonance with Silas, produces immediate, character-earned cost that forecloses isolation without tidy recovery. Interiority stays concrete— “shockwaves… up her arms” —never lapses into therapy‐speak.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—data purity vs. covert intervention—is embodied in the micro-choice to encode the warning in weather symbols; the cost of unlocked gate and compromised solitude is felt. Curiosity is credibly particular: she spots indigo dye, cross-references pressure. Motivation escalates from self-protection to zone stewardship without epiphany overload.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s grief is embodied in trembling fingers and the vial’s weight; his interior contradiction—clinging to scent while fearing its cost—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (“broker no more lanterns”) is earned by the Bloom’s revelation and carries visible cost. Only a slight drift toward abstract interiority near the climax keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—preserve beauty vs. share it—drives every micro-choice; the slipknot re-weaving embodies her ethical playfulness with visible cost. Emotions are embodied in trembling rope fibers and clay grit, not labels. The final renunciation (leaving the grotto) is earned by prior tactile communion with time’s texture. Minor slip: “poet’s mind” is a touch diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—fear of shattering the hush versus hunger to restore sound—play out in embodied micro-choices (tracing glass, dipping bowl, slack bow). The final renunciation of silence carries visible cost: the warped violin groans, the greenhouse acoustics distort, and the chronic hush is not defeated but re-inhabited. Interiority is specific, sensorily grounded, and avoids diagnostic labels. Only a slight over-reliance on ancestral memory keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s professionally thorough habit generates key beats: the static-electricity test verifies the petal, the methodical inhale structures the emotion, and her affectionate detachment crystallizes when the half-truth births authentic empathy. Every micro-choice traces to her core desire to fuse insight with empathy, anchoring the final renunciation’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s shift from profit-driven broker to empathetic initiator is credibly seeded in prior debt to Mateo; Elena’s grief is embodied in the trembling locket. The micro-choice to draft “Project Silent Currents” crystallizes a new value hierarchy with visible cost to his former identity. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, though one stock phrase (“profit alone had never sparked…”) slightly dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—reed-bird work fused with body tension when Weaver is glimpsed—yet lines like “the ache flared, beautiful and sharp” teeter toward raw articulation. Her empathy seeds three key beats (Hemlock reveal, group tag hunt, arbor conception); edited opening would tighten micro-moments into unequivocal darkness and depth. She earns a lasting cost in renouncing solitude, so character integrity holds despite slight summary haste.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara emerges as a fully embodied artist-tracker—her trembling ink-stained hands, panting micro-decisions, and postponed moth draft vivify internal contradiction. Every beat (sketching, knife-strike, pendant pull) turns on her choice under rising stakes; her renunciation of linear time incurs palpable vertigo.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the glass-eye ritual and mosaic tracing reveal her under pressure. The final insight—“absence was not an end but an interval”—is earned by prior sensory struggle and costs her the comfort of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quietly obsessional caretaker complex meshes with an embodied nostalgia for her grandfather, grounding every movement: her hands recall pipe-smoke even as she prepares the archival sleeve. The contradiction is visible when her longing to “become visible” finally collides with the urge to give Mrs. Gable voice; the cost is Elara’s renunciation of any public credit, felt in the final retreat into shadow. Interiority is consistently tactile and selective, avoiding explanatory drift—except where “invisibility” edges on abstraction, a minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs surrender—drives every beat; the moment she kneels and loosens the soil is a visible micro-choice that costs her prior identity. Embodied emotion (rain on sleeves, leaf weight) is specific and character-bound. The final smile carries earned ambiguity: she has not “won” but redefined her role. No relationship crucible is needed; single-POV interiority suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s insomnia, painterly vocation, and survivor guilt braid into every micro-choice; the trembling fingers, oilskin coat, and final refusal to paint war wounds all embody her contradictory need to both remember and forget. The brooch triggers a credible shift from isolation to tentative re-engagement, and the cost—loss of her former artistic mission—is felt in the last beat. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. Only the brief historian scene dilutes direct pressure, keeping her just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clarity vs. blindness—is embodied in the tactile dissonance of crystal song; the final renunciation of grand prediction for attentive listening is earned by the pearl’s visceral cost and her trembling reach into shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between archival duty and active “heartening” is dramatized through micro-choices (cleaning the valve, choosing staggered blasts). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost—she forfeits anonymity and assumes the burden of hope. Only a slight over-articulation of motive in “She would hearten” nudges it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—analytical mapping vs. emotional avoidance—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (kneeling, punching cracks, whispering guilt). The final renunciation of cartographic detachment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the mother-vial). Interiority is concrete, voice-specific, and avoids diagnostic labels. Only minor: the spectral beggar remains off-page, so status dynamics aren’t tested.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. reluctant belief—is embodied in the micro-choice to place the tile; the final renunciation of skepticism carries visible social cost when she risks ridicule to save the whales. The shift from “keeper of relics” to “witness” is earned through prior causality and felt cost. Minor slip: the mentor’s voice surfaces as convenient exposition rather than embodied memory.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aeon’s contradictory impulses—boredom vs. desperate curiosity—are dramatized in every beat: tracing the shard, weighing its hunger, choosing release. His embodied reactions (“crushing boredom had lifted”) mark earned change. The final renunciation carries visible cost: loss of the only tether to meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority feels sharp: Elara’s simultaneous refusal to lie and desperate equation-making collide in body-level tension (“wrist tremored as ink hung from nib”). Her micro-choice—offering her father’s network knowledge as asset—rings true to the “honest child” contradiction, but because we don’t see Silas physically, the backstory reflection tilts summary toward 20 % BRR ceiling, capping higher resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling finger, the hum in her molars, the tears of “aching connection.” Motivation is clear and intensifies: from studious observer to desperate refractor of time. The final beat crystallizes her stance—she prepares for the next resonance—earning a quiet but felt cost. Only the absence of a second character keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid—grief embodied in the “hollow ache” and the shell’s warmth. His contradictory drive to debunk yet yearn for Elara’s mythic silence is dramatized through the cello bow. The final renunciation—accepting the void—carries felt cost, though the shift from skeptic to celebrant feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s dual allegiance is dramatized through micro-choices: the scarf adjustment, the chip pressed into Elara’s hand. Interior contradiction—hope vs desperation—drives every beat. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: he forecloses open mediation in favor of covert resistance. Voice and motive remain coherent; no diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s elegiac drive and embodied micro-choices (kneeling to the meteorite shard, pocketing the grain) anchor interiority; the final renunciation—carrying memory instead of intervening—earns its cost. One contradictory impulse (scientist vs mourner) is present but not fully dramatized in scene, keeping it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertips “reading” water ripples to map the drone’s fault is a vivid, character-defining micro-choice. Motivation (decode feedback to guide her daughter) is clear and intensifies through the repair. The final smile and drone’s departure crystallize earned stasis with felt cost: her labor becomes the child’s safe passage. Minor slip: “magnetic calm” is repeated without deepening contradiction, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s dry wit and cartographer’s precision are embodied in micro-choices—aligning the dog-eared page with frost, sketching the condensation map—yet interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she’d always trusted data over drama”) rather than live contradiction. The final quiet smile and stove-stoking show earned stasis with visible cost: she accepts possible death if wrong. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s renunciation to surface panic in favor of sealed silence is dramatized through embodied terror (trembling hand, slumped weight against coral); the interior contradiction is present and vivid, but the priestess memories lean summary, not dramatized interaction, lightly capping the 9+ run.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“salt dust on the lattice,” “copperlight repose”); the boy’s contradictory impulses—fear of being blamed vs. need to vanish—drive every beat. Micro-choices (leaning into the confessional, folding the lattice into his tunic) reveal value hierarchy. The final renunciation of his father’s voice lands with felt cost, though the shift from grounded fear to magical buoyancy slightly dilutes credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s guilt and reluctant acceptance are embodied in micro-choices—kneeling, tears freezing, the final smile he returns—yet the ghost bride’s interiority is only gestured at, keeping her slightly archetypal. The debt motive is clear and escalates to self-erasure, but the “lovingly venomous” paradox is asserted more than dramatized in her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is poetic but concrete—“her fingers remembering what the village forgot—grounding abstract purpose in sensorial labor. The bleed from her fingers charging the final image gives visible cost, and her decision to abandon the literal tower for communal reverence is earned by repeated nightly observation and labor.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—archival precision vs. instinctive listening—play out in embodied micro-choices (cleaning the stone, fitting the gnomon). The final act of restoration carries visible cost: Kael’s tears mark the price of remembering. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; exile’s ache is rendered through loam scent and root-bone entanglement rather than labels. One slip: “warmly curious” is asserted more than dramatized in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas’s interiority—his reverence for obsolete ritual, his terror of a “misplaced syllable”—is textured and particular, anchoring the arc. His contradictory motives (yearning for lost texture vs guardianship of anonymity) remain stable. The choice to inscribe “Elias Vale,” tears blurring the dawn, feels earned and renounces the purely evasive meaning he once sought, with visible cost in the tightening of his throat and the brass click that sounds like a heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scatterbrained façade vs razor-sharp operative—drives every beat; her micro-choice to drop the thimble while counting seconds crystallizes the hierarchy of values. The cost is visible: each “clumsy” act tightens the noose of risk around her. Flaw (necessary deception) complicates tactics and is not tidily resolved. Voice remains specific and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—seeking the moment of hesitation yet knowing she cannot change it—are embodied in her bleeding grip on the shard; the final renunciation of blame in favor of understanding is earned through visceral cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is textured and embodied; the coral and cast act as concrete extensions of his psyche. The moment he re-codes “Alone” into “return” is a micro-choice that crystallizes his value hierarchy and costs him the talisman. Mei’s presence is brief but applies immediate pressure; their shared silence carries status shift. The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis in “survivor guilt,” slightly blunting the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s arc from hollow artist to purposeful bearer of rescued light is sharply embodied. The contradiction between abandoning pigment for loss and now reclaiming light is dramatized through micro-choice: the trembling hands loading flawed film, then pressing the switch to resurrect laughter. Her grandmother’s remembered line is earned as causality because the knowledge it encodes yields the closure projector decision; the cost felt is the tear-stained grime on her cheeks. Only a hairline slip: we do not see her decide to come back on subsequent days—the plan is stated rather than crystallized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s shift from certainty to curiosity is embodied in the tactile hobo-nickel choice; the micro-choice to strike it crystallizes her arc. Interiority is vivid and specific, though the visitor remains a cipher, limiting relational crucible. The final renunciation of perfectionist certainty carries visible cost in her altered future work.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s motive—“stand guard over that inner spark”—is clear and embodied through micro-choices (planting the gourd, pocketing the seed). Interiority is specific: “rogue’s grin finally touching his lips” vs. “focused intensity.” The final endurance earns its cost when the Harmonizer pulse meets the garden’s counter-frequency and the spark “held.” Minor slip: Elara’s status/relationship pressure is under-used.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“his mind a relentless tidepool”), but the centuries-long span compresses micro-choices into summary; the final poem-blossom is earned yet the cost feels more stated than dramatized. Motivation (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) is consistent and drives every beat, but the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—methodical caretaking versus the ache of foxglove regret—play out in embodied micro-choices (humming, pressing ear to floor). Her final renunciation of immediate repair in favor of tending the next fracture shows earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her trembling fingers and the ink-well’s pulse ground her contradictory impulses. The “carefully reckless” trait drives every micro-choice, and the final image of the well against her heart crystallizes earned change with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Flaws (arrogance, silence) complicate choices and are confronted, not balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s contradictory duties—public safety vs. sacred preservation—are embodied in trembling hands and the decisive shift to trust Elara’s bypass. Interiority is concrete, rooted in tactile calculation and the weight of legacy. The final choice to activate the hidden channel is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (renouncing modern protocol). Minor slip: “quiet certainty” edges toward tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradictions (once-forger now curator) embody cost in tremulous fingers and the moment she chooses imperfect trust; Earned Stasis cleanly lands. Only slight slack in pigeons as emotional extensions rather than agents.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s grief, intellectual curiosity, and hard-earned reverence are enacted through tactile micro-choices—fingering grain, pacing the bench, stepping back three deliberate paces. Her contradictory impulses (rescue vs respect) coexist through climax, resolving in Earned Stasis that feels both painful and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the burnt feather anchors her contradictory impulses (surface nostalgia vs. deep-sea surrender). Micro-choice—recalibrating lights to mimic kelp—shows ingenuity under pressure. Final shared exhale crystallizes her shift from seeking pattern to accepting shared rhythm. Cost is felt in the dwindling power reserves and the irreversible abandonment of her lone vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“cheerful gloom” repeated) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she kneels and the glass flares amber is the only beat where motive, tool, and micro-choice visibly collide. Otherwise, decisions feel pre-ordained by theme rather than character flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “analytical heart swelling with quiet triumph” shows contradiction between calculation and wonder. Micro-choices (placing the bishop, pocketing it again) reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the earned stasis of beginning her “real performance” after the tide’s closure. No relationship crucible on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for oceanic memory vs. the need to escape censorship—are embodied in the micro-choice to inscribe her own skin. The moment she becomes “spontaneously anchored” crystallizes her cost: body locked, spirit fledged. Motive remains consistent, but the final renunciation (empty vessel left behind) is earned and felt. Interiority is specific, tactile, and avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—hunger for quiet truth vs. clamor for spectacle—drives every beat; the restless hands, the stone’s deliberate pause, the final walk to the workboat all enact the shift from hollow craft to luminous vocation. Embodied emotion (“cold seep through his trousers”) grounds the epiphany without label-speak. The renunciation of spectacle is earned by the pond’s lesson and costs him the lingering chill and the obliteration of the rings—visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kai’s internal contradiction—guilt driving him forward yet anchoring him—propels the micro-choice to reclaim voice through fire’s story. Embodied emotion (“hard scars against weathered skin,” “cradled like a wounded bird”) reveals hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. The credible renunciation of solitary penance for shared vigilance lands with felt cost; minor drift into summarized childhood dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—salt-crystal fractals, needle tremors—but the “logical dreamer” label is asserted more than embodied; her final equation lands as earned epiphany yet the cost (isolation) is only implied, not dramatized on her body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—his desire to “excavate sorrow” versus his need to carry hope—drives every micro-choice; the moment he smooths the negative against his palm embodies the cost of bearing witness. The shift from mapping acoustics to mapping redemption is earned by prior beats and forecloses the path of mere cataloguing. Flaws (sensitive perception as both gift and burden) complicate tactics under pressure. Only a slight drift toward abstract self-diagnosis in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s interiority is embodied and precise—her calm is a tactical necessity, not a label. The borrowed heartbeat mechanic gives her motive a visceral cost, and her micro-choices (kneeling, humming, sustaining the note) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—vanishing before the third bell—earns its poise through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—protocol vs. humility—play out in the moment of public self-indictment; the embodied tremor and deliberate touch of the clipboard ground her interiority. The cost is palpable: political suicide made concrete in the promise to dismantle the outpost. Kael’s flicker of possible trust alters their crucible. Only a trace of diagnostic self-awareness (“ash in her mouth”) keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thorne’s contradictions (profit vs. preservation, ruthless vs. tender) are vividly embodied in micro-choices—his stiff-kneed kneel, the velvet pouch he won’t hand away, the tremor in “rough” voice. Internal tension sustains throughout; every outward act is laced with private regret, culminating in the non-biological offering whose “echo” still costs him the last shard of denial. Only slight over-articulation of “amorality” softens the internal contradiction by one notch.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—chaste courtesan whose body is “a vessel for poetry rather than pleasure”—is embodied in every micro-choice; the memory of her mother’s harvested voice tightens motive and pays off in the final tug. The cost is palpable: she forfeits the “fragile safety her station afforded,” a price named on the page. One slip: the phrase “weaponized grace” edges toward label-speak in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interior struggle—manipulator-versus-revealer—is embodied in micro-choices (finger pressure on the story stick, breath against dome chill) and crystallizes in the earned renunciation: they will lay the stick down, inviting complicity. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, cost is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her reverence for the wing, the calloused fingers, the tears—yet the “esoteric realist” label is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. The final stillness is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt-to-forgiveness arc is embodied in tactile micro-choices (loosening the braid, steadying her breath), and the final bronze pour crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak. The “technically gentle” trait is dramatized, not labeled. Minor: the shift from guilt to purpose feels compressed, but the final action validates the change.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—obedience to a crumbling directive vs. surrender to the forest’s will—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (lifting the seal, pressing it into the arch). The final renunciation of “guard” for “witness” is earned by the embodied cost of dissolving the seal and the lightning diverted. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the slight over-articulation of “why paths choose walkers” keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his frugality as vow, the tile as sacred relic—but the final beat (“tears pricked his eyes”) edges toward summary rather than embodied cost, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifist scheming is embodied in micro-choices (timing the music box, waiting in silence) and her interior contradiction—manipulating memory to heal—creates credible tension. Kael’s resentment is shown through bodily tension and the gasp-triggered thaw, not labels. The final release is earned by the prior cellular-memory setup and carries visible cost in Kael’s shuddering exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—practical craftswoman chasing an impossible dream—drives every beat; the shift from “fix the sextant” to “become the sextant” is embodied in the synchronized breathing and costs her the comfort of certainty. Silas’s grounded presence supplies external pressure that forces her stance crystallization. Only a trace of diagnostic self-awareness (“she saw it: her grandfather’s dream…”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Contradictory impulses—stubborn persistence vs need for reconciliation—play out in embodied tension (quartz eye vs tear); micro-choice to re-purpose the ribbon is costly, turning keepsake into lifeline with no back-pedal. Liora’s re-entry reads credibly via inherited feistiness, a reversal made inevitable by the grandmother–mother–child genealogy that had previously broken. Interiority stays specific and sensory rather than therapeutic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid (“brightened disquiet” crystallizes his awe and dread), and the micro-choice to pocket the shell propels the loop. Yet the ancestor/future-self visions arrive as external exposition rather than embodied conflict, muting the cost he must pay to close the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “carefully resourceful” trait drives the costly choice to surrender a private lesson, embodied in blood-ink. Kael is functional but thin; his disbelief is generic, not character-specific. The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost, satisfying the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her “blissfully aberrant calm” and salt-stained fingers anchor her—but the sister-motive is asserted more than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized until the final beat, so the earned-cost threshold is only partially met.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied (“ink-stained fingers,” “flutter in her chest”), and her methodical trait constrains every micro-choice. The final act of weaving the seal into the rope is credibly motivated by her prior research and emotional need to mend absence. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, specific, and contradictory—her exhaustion clashes with razor-sharp mapping knowledge—while her kneeling micro-choice and the final renunciation of the map create an earned, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her trembling hands and thistle-clung robes externalize the weight of her conviction. The retrocognitive flashes are woven into present action, not exposition, and her final sob as she twists the shard shows earned cost. Minor slip: “threadbare robes” edges toward stock, but the specificity of thistle seeds redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is vivid, rooted in sensory detail (“damp edge of the observatory’s stone sill”). The contradictory impulse—preemptive nostalgia versus duty—acts simultaneously and shapes the final resolve. Micro-choice of pressing palm to crystal is embodied and redefines her identity. The ache is felt, but no blind spots or genuine flaws create compounded mistakes, and cost reads as opportunity rather than irreversible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt and need for defiance are embodied in micro-choices—picking up the rag, lighting the single match—each carrying visible cost. The shift from “Step. Breathe. See.” to “Step. Breathe. Create.” crystallizes earned change without tidy redemption. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. One more beat of contradictory impulse mid-scene would have pushed this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the cicada and droplet crystallize her contradictory impulses. The final stance—returning to Kael with “quiet certainty”—is earned by the grotto’s micro-epiphany. Yet the apprentice remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only implied, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and silence-hunger are embodied in trembling lungs and micro-choices; the porcelain doll’s warming cheek and the vine’s sprout crystallize her shift from hoarding to nurturing silence. The final decision to carry the hush downward is earned by prior failures and surrender, with visible cost in her tears and the doll’s transformation. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases edge toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his storm-glass reading, calibrated humming, and memory of the derailment all reveal layered motives. The “fluidly logical” trait is dramatized through micro-adjustments of pitch and pole, not asserted. Cost is felt: he renounces fares and risks shattering the terrace to re-tune silence. Only minor reserve: the mentor’s quoted maxim edges toward convenient wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—urgency vs. caution—play out in micro-choices (coaxing paint, angling the flake). The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost. A hairline slip: “wisely adventurous” is asserted more than dramatized in the moment of ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her scars ache, her fingers stain, her grief is the bridge. The contradiction between guarding the line and longing to heal is dramatized in the kneel-and-reach moment. The final renunciation (burning the child’s tether) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. One step short of 9+ only because the sister backstory is slightly more summarized than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s survivor guilt and repurposed-skeptic drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tightening the stolen bolt, lunging for the lever). The contradictory pull between past victimhood and present protector role charges every beat, culminating in a visible cost: the diamond she cannot sell. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “virtuously mischievous” is asserted twice rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradictions—heir vs dynasty-ender, relief vs cost—live in embodied micro-motions and silent decisions. The final renunciation lands with visible emotional price traced floor-to-shadow rather than stated aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Torin’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the vow to guard possibility—is embodied in the trembling hand on glass and the counter-clockwise trace; the final unsnapping is earned by the Oracle memory and visibly costs his withdrawal. Minor slip: “shivering bliss” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her grief and nascent purpose feel earned. The micro-choice to catalog the button separately crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she re-enters the work she had been avoiding. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s quiet fury over his sister’s erasure is embodied in tactile micro-choices—palming the key, reading starlit puddles—rather than labels. The final renunciation (dropping the key and vanishing) is earned by prior resourcefulness and carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no stock phrasing intrudes. One slip: the phrase “tyranny of indifference” edges toward label-speak, blunting the edge slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’ interiority is embodied and particular (condensation-damp fingers, the brass chill against his lip), and the hereditary burden is sharply conveyed without cliché. The earned renunciation—choosing to preserve silence through breathy gaps rather than notes—is dramatized through concrete micro choices and feels costly in the final image (“the last note hanging like a dewdrop”). Yet motivation remains somewhat abstract—why this ritual works and why only he must do it is never dramatized—keeping it from an 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s compulsive seed-sorting ritual and reverence for life’s encoded language are embodied with precision; her final pivot from preservation to prophetic curation earns a drastic, credible change, foreclosing the safe “archivist” path and igniting forest-wide resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—precision vs surrender—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (calipers vs improvised chain-net). The final renunciation of the compass lands with visible cost: he abandons the very proof he sought, earning the unplanned path. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. One slip: “uncertainly certain” is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—clinical control vs. emotional surrender—are dramatized in the two mercury pours; the second succeeds only when he relinquishes the need to “fix” Elara and instead honors her living memory. Interiority is specific and embodied (“heavy as lead yet fragile as glass”), and the final renunciation (carrying the break rather than erasing it) is earned with visible cost. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness mid-epiphany that edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle release vs. brutal truth—is dramatized in her micro-choices (kneel, tooth placement, crescendo on mis-harp). The arc from empathetic witness to active healer arcs credibly; laughter redemption is earned. Close reading shows no name drift or stock traits.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s embodied trauma and proprioceptive precision are vivid; the contradictory drive to endure yet decode mercy is dramatized in every micro-shift of stance. The pewter strap’s tactile echo anchors interiority without exposition. Final step earns credible renunciation—pain not escaped but mapped—yet interiority flirts with abstract “mathematics” labels near the end, blurring contradiction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the lens fragment anchors contradictory impulses (honor vs. practical risk) that culminate in the decisive turn of the brass key. The grandmother’s remembered voice is the only reflective block and it tilts the present choice. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation stays character-bound and intensifies to the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s “skillfully observant” trait is dramatized through concrete dust-reading and ceiling-scans that directly enable discovery; the interior contradiction between professional detachment and personal ache is shown, not told. The final act of winding the bird is earned by this established perceptual obsession and carries visible cost (he accepts the sorrow of release). Ghost-interaction stays consistent with his unflinching vocation, avoiding convenient awe. Minor slip: the “weightless burden” refrain edges toward label-speak twice, blunting full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his palm on the pane, the vial’s cold burn—but the “why” of stealing the whisper is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation (returning the vial) is earned by the causal chain, yet the cost feels more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary guilt vs. visionary hope—are embodied in her trembling recitation and the shard’s cold weight. The final renunciation (“I shattered the vase, and with it, the future”) lands with earned cost, though Varek’s ideological certainty feels sketched rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s flaw (rust covenant) manifests in crystallizing choice: one harmonic misstep costs flesh, forcing a visceral commitment deeper. Internal voice is distinct, grounded in scent of metal & shudder of copper. Passivity would drop it, but the choice to find peace in reclaimed light is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory desire to measure wonder yet surrender to mystery is dramatized in the final step into the lagoon. The compass acts as an externalized heartbeat that tightens her choice. Cost is felt—she abandons her instruments—though the renunciation could be sharpened one degree more.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“turbine-hum reverie that vibrated deep in her ribs”), her motivation to scaffold chaos into simplicity is dramatized through the lantern-slide visions and the final choice to carve the spiral. The contradiction between fear and reverence is present but not fully simultaneous in scene; the cost is felt yet slightly generalized. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief and artistic identity are embodied through tactile detail (ochre-stained fingers, velvet pouch). The shift from shouting pain onto walls to “umbral tenderness” is earned via Leo’s revealed notes and her final choice to paint the pavilion wall. Interior contradiction—wanting answers yet fearing silence—remains active in scene. Cost is visible: she trades raw anguish for quiet creation, foreclosing the louder mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingers “smudged with lagoon sediment,” the diary’s “retrocognitively trapped sorrow” clinging like humidity—but the final beat of scrambling down the ladder feels slightly under-motivated; the cipher key arrives as gift rather than earned cost. Still, his embodied dread and micro-choices (arranging debris, touching the diary) keep him credibly flawed and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s refusal of false comfort is dramatized through micro-choices (tightening grip, turning away from the bottle). Motivation to rebuild civilization is clear and escalates to the final mental labor. The Earned Stasis—choosing memory over illusion—carries visible cost in the strain of working memory. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias's drive to archive emotions is embodied through tactile details (trembling fingers, burning wax), and the immersive action that reawakens childhood memory carries clear stakes. His final scream is costly, yet the contradictory impulse—pity versus duty—stays abstract. Interior monologue leans toward explanatory rather than raw contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—steady hands vs. war-drum heart—and her micro-choice to remove mittens and align the Cap is embodied and costly. The “furiously tranquil” state is dramatized, not labeled, and the final smile carries earned, visible cost. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—protocol vs. listening—play out in real time. The final renunciation of the switch is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (solitude, professional risk). One slip: “humble pride” edges toward label-speak, blunting the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s grief-rooted need to feel useful is embodied in every sweep of the broom and every press of the yellow glass; the storm forces a credible, costly choice to endure rather than flee, aligning motive with action. Interiority is specific—star-dust under nails, “shattered glass” heart—yet the final beat of polishing brass with glittering knuckles crystallizes the earned stasis. Minor slip: “spiritually curious” is stated more than dramatized beyond the empathy ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s silence and guardianship are embodied in every beat; the astonishment, the mute resolve, and the final acceptance of keeperhood all flow from prior causality. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between guarding the box and the ghosts’ demand, resolved by Earned Stasis with visible cost—his lifelong silence must now deepen into active listening. No stock phrasing; each micro-choice (tracing dew, sitting before the box) reveals hierarchy of values. Flaw: the “astonishment” label is asserted more than dramatized in body.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—guardian duty vs self-reckoning—show through her tactile handling of the urn fragment and the risky message embedding; her final stance of patient waiting is earned and carries visible cost in the form of ongoing exposure. Interiority is specific, though brief recourse to "texture" as label slightly dulls the peak. A bit more embodied contradiction at decision point would have lifted this into 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her shift from sterile perfectionism to embracing imperfection is dramatized through the feather retrieval and the micro-choice to release it. Motivation remains consistent, and the final renunciation carries felt cost. Minor slip: “poet’s heart” is a stock phrase that momentarily flattens voice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is embodied and consistent—“brazen calm” threads through every beat—but the final renunciation (“They will remember this. Not me, but the pact.”) is slightly under-costed; the physical toll is gestured rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her rebellion distilled into the micro-choice of scraping rain-borne soil into a petri dish. Internal conflict (yearning rigor vs derision from peers) shows via the amber clasped to her skin and the spectrometer’s pulse, grounding motivation in tactile stakes. The final change is earned: her tears and pocketing of the vial enact a quiet renunciation of prior contempt—a stance with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief-rooted resolve to heal the battlefield is embodied in every micro-choice; the pods, birds, and languages all press against his need to atone. Interiority stays concrete—knuckles white, pods rattling, salt on tongue—without slipping into label-speak. The final scattering is earned: the cost is the reef’s silence he must carry forever.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is visceral and scent-driven, yet late appearance of cost keeps it just under 9.0; final renunciation (“He wouldn’t dig…”) is credible but not deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—shame vs. communion—surface in the charcoal tremor and the pivot toward Polaris; the cost of exile is felt, but the interiority drifts toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s “chivalrous thief” identity and apprentice motive are embodied through micro-choices (the starlight offerings, the acorn thank-you) that reveal reverence under pressure, but interior contradiction is mild—fear is stated but never threatens his next move, so the cost feels more decorative than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s survivor guilt and historian mission are embodied in tactile micro-choices—unbinding the journal, placing the pawn—yet the “benevolently ruthless” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to read—are dramatized in the tactile choice to press the feather to stone; the cost (re-opening the wound) is embodied in the surge of memory. Interiority is specific and embodied (“tears cut paths through the dust”), not diagnostic. The final renunciation—carrying home inside her skin—earns its poise through prior causality. Minor slip: “buried talents lay dormant” is slightly label-speak, but immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s shame, misread gambit, and dawning self-forgiveness are all embodied in tactile knot-work and thread-plucking; interior contradictions visible in her hesitation-stillness pair with decisive micro-choice to stop fidget. Cost is felt—“the villagers’ silent judgment” and the “hard-won clarity” she now carries away.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—calloused hand, quartz warmth, memory of children’s giggles—yet the “innocently mischievous” trait is asserted more than embodied in the final beat. The contradiction between fear and mercy is dramatized in the quartz raise, not summarized. Vanya’s micro-softening is credible, but her reversal feels slightly compressed; still, the cost of Kael’s stance is legible in the shared tears and the canyon’s new harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—doubt vs. desperate hope—are embodied in trembling hands and the acid sting; the final renunciation (letting the sea take her) is earned by the prior mending act and its visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “kintsugi intentions” edges toward label-speak mid-crisis, blunting the embodied contradiction by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory yet seeking release—are embodied in her trembling hand over the shell; the final renunciation is earned by fifteen years of grief and the cave’s demand for presence. Interiority is specific and painterly, never diagnostic. The “intimately aloof” trait constrains her entry into the cave and shapes the solitary release. Cost is visible in the tears and the deliberate not-looking-back.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eli’s decisions—staying when Mara collapses, using the vial, trusting scent over sound—spring from a layered interiority that forecloses safer paths. His contradictions (fear vs faith, shouting vs whisper) perform in-scene, not in summary. Endpoint: he earns renunciation of noise as effective action with felt cost—silence that saves the Marigold—and the closure is anchored by character choice, not happenstance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s grief is embodied in brass seams and solder burns; contradictory impulses—cling to memory vs. build a counter-signal—co-exist in every micro-choice. The final ignition of the censer with their tears crystallizes a renunciation that costs the last relic of Elara, earning the closure under Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—rational detachment vs. desperate need for psychic quiet—drives every beat; the glass-eye choice crystallizes her hierarchy of values (self-protection > communal comfort) with visible cost to Hemlock. Embodied emotion (“pressure build behind her own eyes”) grounds the abstract stakes. Minor slip: “psychological safety” flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is quickly re-embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is textured and embodied—his salt-knotted fingers, the ache for mountains he’s never seen—but the borrowed memories arrive as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost. The Edelweiss reprise earns a micro-choice (cradling it, pressing it into the logbook) that seals his renunciation of solitude, yet the stranger’s absence keeps relational pressure off-stage. Still, the arc from isolation to custodial witness is credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s loneliness is embodied in tactile shop rituals and sharpened by the dwindling creek-time; his “empirically intuitive” trait is dramatized when he deciphers the ant trail under pressure. Interior contradiction surfaces in the hope-versus-doubt tug around the doorway. The final renunciation—choosing the map of his own making—carries visible emotional cost and is seeded by every prior choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority pulses—"disenchanted heart," "lead crowns"—and that remembered exhale with Lyra becomes the fulcrum that flips her stance from abdication to active guardianship; the maternal impulse and the inherited crown finally integrate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction (desire to bottle grief vs awakened understanding that presence > capture) is embodied and coherent, but the pivot feels marginally abrupt due to compressed interiority near the climax, and Kael’s function is mostly expository without added status pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—"feral nostalgia clawed" and "jaded wonder" embody the split self. The envy of her younger self is dramatized in the dream and on the porch, culminating in the earned, costly embrace of both abysses. Motivation to distill chaos into narrative is consistent and drives every beat. One hairline slip: “diagnostic label-speak” in “chronologically confused dread” without immediate embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her silent polishing of the bowl is a micro-choice that reweights her stance toward Chen and her own loss. Chen’s grief is legible through the worn birthing-clamp screw and his deliberate avoidance, but the final nod feels slightly under-motivated; more tactile hesitation would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, crystallizing knuckles, the tremor that locks joints—yet the epiphany that “scars could be ink” arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost. Still, the embodied affliction and micro-choice to abandon the tea for the quill earn a credible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. professional detachment—are embodied in her frayed-wire ritual and self-correcting metaphors. The micro-choice to electrify the bottle crystallizes her hierarchy of values: apology over exorcism. Silas’s translucent presence supplies external pressure that alters their shared status. Cost is felt: the apology cannot save the orchard, only mend the fracture between them.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and embodied—his “threadbare robes whispering” and the “quiet urgency” of his witness role anchor motive. The contradiction between outward stillness and inward spiral is dramatized in each micro-choice (pausing, tracing, aligning spine with crack). Cost is felt when the library dissolves and he becomes “weaver,” a role he cannot renounce. Minor slip: “cosmic tongue” edges toward abstraction rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the key’s asymmetry and warmth anchor his contradictory impulses. The final bow and deliberate footsteps crystallize a credible renunciation with felt cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—duty vs. curiosity—is embodied in the micro-choice to intercept rather than alert; the laser pointer hand-off carries visible cost (loss of control). Spatial gift is label-only until the final spatial geometry of release, limiting depth. Recognition with the physicist feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—mathematical certainty vs. human hope—are embodied in her subway micro-choices and final bedside gesture; the cost of re-evaluating her father is palpable. Interiority is specific, never generic. The only drag is a brief “theoretically rebellious” label that tells rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet enforcing estrangement—drives every beat; the glass disc under his thumb and the refusal to give Elena his name both embody the cost of his mission. The final renunciation (“Wrong number”) is earned by prior scenes and carries visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the locket photo and ink ritual anchor contradictory impulses of grief and hope. The final micro-choice—handing the vellum to the girl—earns its cost through prior beats and visibly forecloses the path of solitary preservation. Minor slip: “haunted euphoria” is slightly diagnostic label-speak, but it lands within two lines of embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—desperate hope vs. practiced jocularity—are embodied in the cracked spectacles and the moon-rock thumb-rub; his final renunciation of the “cure” for the circle of reciprocity is earned and carries visible cost in the softened voice and communal laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied grief and tactile navigation are vivid; contradictory impulses (seeking stillness yet fearing its cost) play out in real time. Micro-choices—kneeling, scraping earth, tracing the final note—are character-specific and escalate stakes. Closure choice (forging the map of healing) is earned by prior sensory struggle and carries felt cost. Minor: “quiet blaze within” flirts with label-speak but is immediately grounded in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (guilt vs hope, certainty vs doubt) manifest on-page when “confidently uncertain resolve” steers her unbending of the pen. Interior contradiction and micro-choices are embodied—“hands moved with confidently uncertain grace”—and the final renunciation of certainty as purpose earns a visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—rebellion against forgetting vs. acceptance of invisibility—drive every micro-choice. Kael’s silent counsel crystallizes her stance without diluting her agency. The final renunciation (playing the silence alone) carries visible cost: she remains unseen yet validated by the harbor’s song. Minor slip: “joyful sorrow” is named rather than dramatized at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “volcanic tenderness” line crystallizes her contradictory impulses. Motivation is consistent—guardian vs. arsonist—and the final renunciation (sealing the archive) is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: “analytically intuitive” is label-speak that never manifests in a concrete micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-driven compulsion is embodied in the drumming and the desperate sustain of the lagoon vision; the contradiction between hope and the machine’s limits is palpable. The final stillness carries visible cost—her hands fall silent, the dream collapses—earning the Earned Stasis closure. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “guinea pig” label is external, not self-concept, but it doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s gait-recognition trait is embodied in two on-page choices (mimicking electrician, limping past Rourke) that cost him physical strain and risk. Interiority stays concrete: “pulse quickened,” “coin pressed like promise.” Final smile shows earned endurance with cost—the Whisperer’s proof exacts ongoing vigilance. No contradictory impulses in scene, but trait never complicates his self-image, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s interiority is embodied in her tactile handling of the mirror and shutters; her “spiralingly calm” trait constrains every micro-choice. The child’s shift from despair to wonder is credible because the guardian’s restraint withholds comfort and instead offers proof. Motivation is dramatized, not stated: the final closing of shutters shows the cost of leaving the child in darkness now armed with memory. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives crystallize through micro-choices—the library exit, the hidden card—showing motive pushing to action. Silent students’ fears are dramatized as pressure rather than interior exposition, making the renunciation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—shore duty vs. sea nature—are dramatized in the tightening grip on the scrimshaw and the final step into water; the transformation is earned by prior embodied memories and costs her human identity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief-rooted need to “cultivate lightness” is embodied in every whittling stroke and narrated mundane act; the contradictory impulse to hide sorrow while preserving it is dramatized, not summarized. The final renunciation—choosing the fragile hush over open rebellion—carries visible cost when Mrs. Gable’s warning crystallizes the stakes. Interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent; no stock phrases intrude. The only gap is that Mrs. Gable’s presence is brief, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is light.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (reverence vs. transgression) play out in micro-choices—kneeling, weaving vapor, pressing shadow to quartz. The tremor of certainty anchors her arc with felt cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s color-blindness and tactile art practice are embodied in every beat; the reed tongue and quartz trade crystallize his flaw-driven need. Elara’s brief presence supplies external pressure without diluting single POV. The final renunciation—return of the reed—earns the cost of his “awakening” to imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the calluses, the hum in her bones, the tears through dust all ground her quest. Motivation (“texture of connection”) is reiterated but never abstract—it drives every micro-choice from lens adjustment to the final bell strike. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of motive in reflective patches (“artificial pilgrimage,” “question assumptions”) that edges toward label-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—grief-numbed craft vs. the fragile spark to “teach withering to bloom”—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the locket, folding vellum cranes). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits memorializing death to cultivate life, signaled by the pressed petal returned to her. Motivation stays rooted in her craft and loss; no stock epiphanies intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her fingertip on condensation, the brass tape’s cold bite—yet her contradictory impulses (scholarly detachment vs. empathic pull) remain under-articulated until Maya arrives. The final stance crystallizes: she trades false comfort for diagnostic rigor, a renunciation with visible cost in Maya’s drying tears. Secondary pressure from Maya is immediate and status-shifting, but Elara’s flaw (over-quantifying grief) never quite boomerangs on her.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for knowledge yet fearing its cost—drives every micro-choice; the embodied tremor of her hands and the deliberate fracturing of her own breath show a credible struggle. The final renunciation of patterned nostalgia is earned by the prior demonstration of its lethal pull, and the cost (loss of her own innocence) is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—cataloging hope while unknowingly feeding the shadow—drives every micro-choice; the river-stone memory she injects is a visible, costly renunciation that forecloses the naive shared dream. Interiority is embodied in calloused fingers and the stone’s warmth, not labels. The luminous regret is earned, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “hollow ache” and deliberate micro-choices under pressure ring true. The contradiction between self-respect and compassion is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation (reporting the dealer, slow-healing the chameleon) is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “diagnostic label-speak” in “traumatized animal” momentarily flattens voice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—healing vs. reopening—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (coffee-ring divination, tunneling through ivy). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: the hourglass’s failure forces him to accept his scar as testament rather than wound. Interiority is concrete, though “closure seeker” label appears once too cleanly. Flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—“to find where unused love is stored”—is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“vault of yearning”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to absorb the love is credible, yet the psychic cost is asserted more than dramatized. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s moonstruck interiority is embodied in every beat—her “eyes perpetually reflecting the night sky” and her tactile use of the astrolabe. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. exhaustion) act simultaneously as she kneels, traces, and finally collapses. The final renunciation—utter depletion in exchange for release—is earned and costly. Minor slip: “stardust remembered” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied cost overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his dreamlessness, the weight of vigilance, the tactile habit of touching the clock—but the shift from “guard relics” to “cultivate sparks” is more declared than dramatized; the final beat lacks a visible cost that would fully earn the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for untamed clarity while armoring herself with civilized thought—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (placing the gear on her chest, climbing the gear-platform). The final reintegration of her mind is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost (tears cutting oil). Minor slip: “wild frontier of her own mind” edges toward label-speak, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but generic; the “broken leash” and “unused courage” remain abstractions rather than embodied contradictions. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; the star-shaped sand moment is epiphany-by-prop rather than earned shift. Motivation is stated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for song yet clinging to the fortress’s slow healing—are embodied in the bolt’s weight and her final bow. The interiority is specific, but the “seraphically mundane” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand. Micro-choice to place the bolt on the piano earns the Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s quiet guardianship and Elara’s trembling resolve are embodied and specific; the moment Aris inscribes the final clue and then raises his hand to speak “Witness” crystallizes a lifetime of duty with visible cost. Interiority is spare but character-bound; the single word carries the weight of centuries. Varek’s sneer and lunge are externalized, but his collapse feels slightly schematic rather than psychologically earned. Overall, a strong, if compressed, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s motivation is vivid—grief and scientific duty fused—but interiority drifts into exposition (“his motivation burned with quiet urgency”) rather than embodied contradiction. The tapping rhythm is a nice micro-choice, yet it never forces a costly decision; it merely soothes. Closure’s renunciation is credible, but the cost feels generalized (“some losses were irreversible”) rather than personally staked.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s barefoot contact with the permacrete and the hum beneath her skin embody her motivation; the internal contradiction—awkward confidence versus gnawing void—drives her micro-choice to kneel and align the glasses. The final renunciation of war for resonance carries a felt cost: she forfeits immediate vengeance for uncertain renewal. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara is vivid—age, plant-telepathy, and insurgent stance fused in every beat; her contradictory impulses (tradition vs evolution) act simultaneously in-scene. Cost on page when she renounces passive waiting to unseal the embryo, sealing her outlaw status.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—terror vs. the need to plant—are embodied in the freeze, the thumb on the photograph, the deliberate dig. Motivation is rooted in loss and penance, intensifying to the final renunciation: she plants knowing the cliff will fall. The pearl of stillness is dramatized as a bodily practice, not a label. Only the photograph’s edges feel slightly soft from over-handling in the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—artist who no longer believes likeness equals life—grounds every micro-choice; the thread-untangling literalizes her psyche under pressure. Embodied ache (“rough floorboards biting her knees”) keeps emotion physical. Final renunciation of perfect-control belief is earned through causal thread-work, cost visible in luminescent-stained hands. Still, one rhetorical question too many edges toward diagnostic self-talk, blunting peak immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her “serene anger” and the remembered panic is dramatized in the forced re-living of the crash. Micro-choices—activating the drone, willing herself back into trauma—are legible and costly. The final renunciation (carrying the knowledge like a scar) is earned. Minor slip: “consciously wild” is asserted rather than shown in action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s fear-driven micro-choice—upload before pod—earns the turn; ‘bravely conflicted’ is dramatized via shivering hand on reseal then decisive key-strike. Interior contradiction sharpens every beat from trembling to smile at roar of crowd, cost visible when pod seals her as casualty.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s pacifist stance collides with her violent legacy in a single, embodied beat: the deliberate sheathing of the dagger. The internal contradiction—violence vs nurture—drives the climax and is paid for by the risk of losing the farm. Minor slip: “senselessly perceptive” is asserted more than dramatized beyond noticing leaf angles.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s calm desperation is embodied in the cold rail spike and steady hands; the contradictory hope/fear transliterated into vibration shows interior conflict in scene. Motivation (village lullabies) is stated early and drives every beat; the final lullaby carries earned cost. Micro-choices (zigzag path, spike grounding) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV interiority is vivid and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—corporate caution vs. journalistic courage—play out in real time through her micro-choice to uncap the pen and phone Ben. The embodied cost is the click that “echoed…like a starting pistol,” foreclosing her silence. Interiority is specific, e.g., the phrase “reckless idealism” tasting “like ash.” Minor slip: “devotedly observant” is asserted rather than dramatized until the proof sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s guilt is embodied and contradictory—tracing Lyra while seeking silence, then accepting the cry they once fled. Micro-choice to ink the tether shows hierarchy of values: absolution over self-erasure. Cost is visible in the flaring Lyra and the softened console glow. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (whimsy vs gravity) act simultaneously in the mandala beat. The socially perceptive trait is dramatized through micro-choices—reading Torin’s jaw, Lissa’s hands—and then weaponized in the silent interjection. The final renunciation (leaving the mandala to be reclaimed) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: “her soul humming” edges toward label-speak, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his “gentle radical” stance is embodied in tactile micro-choices (sifting ash, pressing the tessera). The contradiction between empathy and steel resolve is dramatized, not labeled, and the final stance crystallizes with visible social cost as the crews lower their tools. Minor slip: “cradle empathy in arms of steel” leans toward slogan, but the surrounding action redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her synesthetic perception and ghostly liminality drive every micro-choice. The contradictory pull between despair and hope is dramatized in the orchard vision, not stated. The final act—reaching for the boy—earns its cost: her own timeline remains fractured, but one child is saved, a visible price paid in the coin’s new pearl.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—mocking telepathy while designing it—grounds every beat; the muscovite handling and micro-choice to modulate light via his own pulse embody motive. Lena’s skepticism-turned-collaboration pressures Aris to crystallize the new protocol, their synced breathing a visible cost. The final renunciation of forced connection for somatic listening is earned and forecloses the pill path.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the fossil’s warmth dissolving her isolation is a concrete micro-choice. The final renunciation—pocketing the fossil and accepting her role as translator—carries visible cost (loss of personal talisman). Minor slip: “factual mysticism” edges toward diagnostic label-speak mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (obedience vs. hope) act simultaneously in the button-mapping beat. The final choice—turning the gold hourglass and preparing to descend—earns its cost through prior causality and visible exhaustion. Mentor’s echo (“Buttons remember…”) anchors motivation without slipping into label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—burned spy’s caution vs. father’s need to mend—are embodied in the tremor of his hands and the deliberate scrape of symbols in snow. The pillbox’s weight and the daughter’s initials anchor interior stakes without exposition. Final nod from Mara crystallizes earned absolution; cost is the years of exile now irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the needle-as-promise anchors contradictory impulses (mend vs. risk) and the final nod to the mother-infant pair crystallizes cost. The only gap is the passengers remain largely anonymous, so relationship pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaito’s interiority is textured—potter’s muscle memory, zen breathing, tactile glass warmth—yet the final renunciation (carrying the shard away) feels slightly under-motivated; no prior beat shows him abandoning the kiln quest. Embodied emotion is strong, but the cost of leaving the oasis is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s wistfully pragmatic interiority is embodied through tactile gardening and lock-picking micro-choices; the gauge-tooth repurposing crystallizes her values under pressure. One contradictory impulse—accepting loss while still fighting darkness—drives every beat. The final renunciation (leaving the transformed escape) carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “wistfully pragmatic” is repeated as label once too often.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet fearing annihilation—are embodied in her scream until her throat bleeds and her final tear-streaked acceptance. Micro-choices (placing the sundial, pressing ear to stone) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The earned shift from isolation to resonant coexistence carries visible cost. Only the Aethon elders’ dissolution is summarized rather than dramatized, a minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—ghostwriter of intimacy yet emotionally sealed—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing damp wood, anchoring the first silk strand). The shift from vessel to participant is earned through visible cost: she relinquishes anonymity and curated distance. One slip: “hollowness fill” abstracts the transformation rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid—his finger smudging yesterday’s coffee stain on the chart is a perfect, embodied tic—but the “cautiously hopeful” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat. The contradiction between terrestrial powerlessness and cosmic agency is present, yet the cost of his sabotage (the station’s imminent shutdown) is external rather than personally felt. Still, the micro-choice to reroute seismic power is specific and stakes his last scrap of credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence/adventure tension are embodied in micro-choices (testing silt with the compass, fighting the urge to flee). The final “hollow victory” stance crystallizes her cost, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward summary (“she felt the weight of all she’d sacrificed”).

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s prosopagnosia and methodical nature are dramatized through ritual pacing and charcoal choice; the final portrait renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority stays embodied, but the late-arriving witness dilutes the crucible to exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—dread vs resolve—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing nail, murmuring stanzas). The final renunciation to stay is earned by the causal chain of deciphering the nail’s purpose, with visible cost: isolation deepens. Interiority stays concrete, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“nervously confident resolve”) nicks the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fiddler’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the “never” verdict while chasing the boy’s promise—are embodied in the glass shard cutting his palm and the moss-threaded bow. Micro-choices (pocketing the flake, descending the hidden ledge) reveal a hierarchy of values: art over safety, hope over despair. The final note played is an earned renunciation of the conductor’s verdict, with the cost of bodily risk and the bow’s fracture made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—flight vs. stewardship—are embodied in the satchel and the charcoal, culminating in the spiral that reclaims the train. The interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the final renunciation carries visible cost. Minor slip: “polished calm” is repeated rather than deepened under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (solitude vs. communal burden) surface in the dream and telescope beats. The final renunciation—“We lift together”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: the mentor’s vanishing is summarized, not dramatized, slightly blunting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his “warlike serenity” and white-knuckled grip anchor us—but the shame/backstory arrives in a single reflective block that tilts the present stance only once; the final pocketing of the shard shows earned cost yet the confession’s shattering feels slightly external to his body.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—dreams of harmony vs. literal root-binding—is embodied in every beat; her micro-choice to bleed into the scar reconfigures both stance and covenant with visible cost. The final kneel in communion, not bondage, earns the shift. No stock phrasing; emotion is muscular and specific. One slip: “anxious elation” repeats as label, not embodied pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reckless idealism is embodied in every micro-choice—trading her future, carving the root, accepting the roots’ claim—yet the interior contradiction between fierce resolve and gentle caretaking is dramatized rather than labeled. The final endurance is earned: her voice becomes the last unbartered thing, sealing her new role as threshold-keeper. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the self-confrontation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liam’s contradictory impulses—cataloguing facts to numb pain while secretly craving resonance—are embodied in the tactile handling of the grille cloth. The micro-choice to revalue the scrap from “minimal” to compass reconfigures his stance with visible cost: discarding the safety of professional detachment. Interiority is specific, sensory, and avoids diagnostic labels. The only minor slip is a brief “ghost of belonging” phrase that edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is precise and embodied—his “worn smooth” fingers, the “aching recognition” in tears—yet the final renunciation (accepting he can never cross the experiential gap) is felt rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to preserve vs surrender to flux—is embodied in the micro-choice to smelt rather than hoard; the moon-phase trait constrains her cognition and visibly alters tactics. The final renunciation (letting identities migrate inward) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “weight of routine transformed into wings” edges toward unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s shift from clinical detachment to empathic witness is dramatized through the single, costly act of relinquishing the pearl; the embodied chill of stone against his knees and the warming sphere in his palm make the interior change tactile. Interiority stays concrete and profession-filtered until the final beat, avoiding label-speak. Still, we get no contradictory impulse in-scene—only a linear replacement of one stance by another—so the change feels slightly smoothed rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—methodical mapping vs. raw surrender—are embodied in the accordion’s wheeze and the graffiti’s imperative. The final renunciation of control is earned by the prior beat of playing the broken chord while weeping, a visible cost that forecloses the old tactic of documentation. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak, though the phrase “raw solace” edges close to label. Overall, a credible arc from guilt to tentative self-forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive, internal contradiction, and embodied emotion are persuasive; the cyclical reflections deepen choice pressure without becoming diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is vivid, rooted in Elara’s plant-telepathy and research past, driving every beat. Renunciation yields earned stasis, but secondary characters (General Vorlag) remain off-page agents rather than crucible, damping relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the grief-etched urgency—but the child Kael remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses in him, so the crucible is one-sided. Motivation is clear and intensifies, yet the “last child” premise is asserted rather than dramatized. Final renunciation (world for one ember) is earned and costly, satisfying the Earned Stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the antique hairpin anchors contradictory impulses of pain and forgiveness. The final realization—that contentment is the act of tending—earns its cost through the ritual’s physical labor and the relinquishing of vengeance. Minor slip: the sister’s absence from the scene limits relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is character-specific and embodied, but his final renunciation registers more as a beatific release than a contradiction actively felt in the moment. The cost—“the cloak pooling at his feet”—is legible, yet the interior struggle stays elegant rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (teaching through delayed revelation) is clear and her youth-regress functions as embodied cost, but Kael’s breakthrough feels slightly guided rather than earned through his own micro-choice; the apprentice’s emotional charge is vivid yet agency light.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“his body a vessel for the land’s ancient song”), but the decades-long backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her “underachieving” label is asserted rather than dramatized; the keystone moment crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris is vivid, self-contradictory interiority (“color of sound” synesthesia versus job duty) anchors every choice; lantern warmth and salt-sting embody emotion. One flaw: grandmother’s riddle line skirts explanatory summary before the descent. Earned refusal of surface resolution at the end (creditable renunciation).

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of coins, the tremor when the gold token resonates—yet the “quiet enthusiasm” label is asserted rather than embodied. The final alignment feels earned because her doubt and method are dramatized, but the emotional contradiction could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief and reaper identity are embodied in tactile ritual; the micro-choice to crystallize echoes rather than reap souls shows a clear, costly shift. Interior contradiction—duty vs. love—surfaces in the moment she whispers the named fears, not in abstract summary. The earned stasis (carrying crystals instead of souls) is scaled to the word count and feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s brittle devotion is embodied in micro-choices—matching breath to five-second drip, guiding bronze with lukewarm magic—earning the fragile Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s grief-tinged resolve is embodied in tactile micro-choices (grip on railing, mud-slick boots, fingers under hearthstone) and the contradictory pull between shielding and revealing family pain. The final decision to “spin the fragments into shared meaning” is earned by the photograph reveal and the felt cost of breaking her grandfather’s silence. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy-speak; the only minor slip is a touch of declarative summation in “she understood his silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is layered—sentiment restrained by rational habit—yet the shift from mistrust to acceptance is dramatized through sensory micro-choices rather than declared; the locket’s pressure and tear-trembling ignition show embodied conflict earning the climactic recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied vigilance and tactile competence ring true; the contradiction between public trust and private dread is dramatized in her micro-adjustments. The muscle-memory motif threads motive to action without therapy-speak. Only the late-cue “colleague panic” flashback feels summary, slightly blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s numbness is embodied in the trembling jar and tears; the contradictory drive to feel again powers the climax. Kael’s corporate certainty collapses under on-page pressure, giving the relationship a crucible moment. The final micro-choice—cradling the jar—earns the thaw with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though “ego death survivor” is more label than lived texture.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “orthogonal approaches” thinking is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (seed weighed, soil patted, room redesign planned). Motivation is consistent and intensifies: safeguarding innovation moves from abstract to embodied guardianship. No contradictory impulses on stage, but the final choice is more quiet acceptance than costly renunciation, capping the arc just short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—ritualized grief vs. the need to heal her family—are embodied in the blower-baton and the shredded-leaf mist; the final easing of her shoulders shows earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“frayed rope worn smooth by desperate hands”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slip is a brief label “mournfully eager” that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guardian rigidity vs. longing for uncertainty—are embodied in her paw trapped by ice yet warmed by the pendant; the final micro-choice (pressing the pendant into earth) costs her former defensive stance and is earned by the vision-beat. Interiority is concrete, e.g. “dimensionally homesick for the whispering stacks,” and emotions stay embodied. The flaw (fear of permeability) directly complicates the climax; resolution accepts its cost, achieving Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aris’s internal paradox—“stoically sensitive”—is embodied in each action: soot-stained failure meets tear-tracks that freeze mid-fall. The urge to ‘interrupt a stifling destiny’ anchors every beat, culminating in the deliberate choice to *vivify* rather than repair. Micro-choices (three failed attempts, near-toss followed by re-gathering) escalate the crisis and display contradiction under duress. The earned Charged Poise (he cradles the living bloom with visible cost) forecloses the old ambition and reconfigures hope.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots ring, her palms thrum—yet the final choice to “tune herself to the hush” arrives with only a conceptual cost; the felt price is implied rather than dramatized, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Leo’s internal contradiction—trembling yet urgent—drives every on-page beat, culminating in the earned renunciation that keeps him forever at the grotto’s edge. His micro-choice to empty the hourglass and embrace eternal transience visibly costs him any future normal life.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradictions—“precise geometric patterns” against the bodily tremor of sinew—are shown through tactile choices; the final braid with the stranger crystallizes a cost exact enough to foreclose the tidy craft she sought. Only minor slip: “discover the texture” drifts toward theme-claim in a single phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s balanced curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—hand on chain, console calibration—yet the interior contradiction between reverence for the past and embrace of alien data is more asserted than dramatized; Kael’s skepticism supplies external pressure but the relationship shift is slight. The final “cradle” reconfiguration is earned, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her childhood memory of sensing her mother anchors her drive—but the “contact tracer for hearts” label is ornamental; her actual choices pivot on curiosity and urgency, not a professional ethic. The moment she kneels and presses the hearing aid to the bench crystallizes her contradictory impulses: duty to reassure versus compulsion to act. Lily’s presence is more prop than crucible; Agnes’s ghostly pressure is the true relationship under strain. The earned cost—Elara breaks protocol to evacuate—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arden’s claustrophobia and mission to honor Vale are embodied in every squeeze and gasp; the final choice to risk drowning for the capsule crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, not diagnostic. One slip: “tears stung… mixing with seawater” edges toward cliché, slightly blunting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—defiance against erasure and reverence for broken data—play out in embodied micro-choices (ink tracing, heartbeat counting). The final acceptance of corrupted segments as valid knowledge is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she remains alone, heartbeat 112, the price of insight. Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. The death-certificate error survivor label is dramatized, not merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—hope vs. the curse—drives every micro-choice; the moment he presses palm to bone and wills texture into hum embodies motive. The final renunciation (carrying the sonic imprint after the diamond dies) is earned and costly. Yet the elders’ tale about starlings arrives as convenient exposition rather than dramatized memory, blunting the flaw-compulsion link.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s yearning is embodied in the locust-shell heartbeat and the micro-choice to “command” the final note; the granite sentinel’s hesitation gives her a relationship crucible that alters both their states. Interior contradiction—duty vs. pulse—is dramatized rather than labeled. The cost (statue’s uprooting, her own hammering heart) is scaled to the word count and forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s layered rebel-mailman identity, embodied choices (the tremor as he presents the manifest, the deliberate lightning-vial flick), and the cleanslate/slate paradox keep characterization keen under pressure; minor edge: the “broken promises heal” motive is told more than dramatized until the Elara letter beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-muteness and tactile devotion to decaying wood are embodied in every motion; the moment he parts his lips to sing, the contradiction between years of silence and sudden voiced hope is palpable, paid for by tears and trembling breath. The micro-choice to kneel and hum carries visible cost—he risks the only identity he has left. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority alone suffices and is sharply particular.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet obsession and embodied ritual anchor her interiority; the scarf’s vibration against her throat crystallizes her shift from seeker to guardian. The cost—solitude maintained while the miracle stays hidden—lands as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s longing is embodied in tactile ritual (dusting moonlight, climbing tower) and micro-choice (switching from pigment to light). Contradictory impulses—clinging to absence vs. chasing reunion—play out in her daily vigil and the final decision to leave. Cost is visible: she abandons the only home that still holds her sister’s trace. Interiority is specific, never generic; the “hollow space” is felt, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's locksmith identity is leveraged in the pivotal ribbon-knot moment; her embodied fear-hunger decision becomes the key turn, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “salt-crusted goggles,” “pulse quickened,” and “tears blurred” anchor emotion in body. The contradictory impulse between decades of resentment and the sudden gentler truth lands with felt cost when she forgives the witch. One slip: the phrase “memories settled into her bones” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—fear of failure vs. fierce protectiveness—play out in real time through her combative tenderness toward Kael. The backward-walking tic embodies anxiety and is weaponized in the final beat when she stops retreating and writes Kael’s insight onto the shard. Kael’s single spoken reversal (“the exile’s in the crack”) is earned by prior mentoring and shifts Elara’s tactics. Cost is visible: she relinquishes her self-punishing stance and risks guild judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara feels lived-in—calloused hands, orchard-born patience, and generational sorrow etched in every choice; her interiority is embodied in weather-chewed knuckles and the tremor that flares at recalling the last Wonderbloom’s death, making her renunciation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—trembling hands, saltwater memory, the lullaby breathed into silence. The contradiction between mending others while remaining broken is dramatized in the moment she must ground her own brother’s echo. Micro-choices (needle slip, thumb prick, whispered lullaby) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Only the “broken mask restorer” label feels slightly external; the rest is lived.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. openness—play out in micro-choices (threading reels, brushing ivy). The final renunciation of “mending borders” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her tears and the vault’s breathing. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s analytic grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices (trembling fingers, micro-tweezers) and contradictory impulses—his drive to dissect loss collides with the need to surrender. The final renunciation of the globe is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (leaving Eleanor’s last words with the ocean). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the “physics of letting go” phrase flirts with abstraction, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grief-choked silence, the bolt plate biting her palm, the rusty voice breaking into song—yet the “driftingly alert” trait never visibly constrains a choice; it reads as atmospheric rather than causal. The final renunciation of silence is earned by the bolt plate’s re-weighting and the ghost’s plea, but the cost (permanent exposure of her voice) is implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the goggles, the remembered scent of mint—but the shift from passive observer to active keeper of the diary is asserted rather than dramatized; the final “lighter” spirit is felt, yet the cost of concealment is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-driven quest is embodied in tactile micro-choices—adjusting the telescope, ignoring oxygen alarms—yet interiority occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction (“emptiness remembers”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The final renunciation (letting the telescope fall) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s blindness and tactile mastery are embodied in every beat; the slip of her fingertip is a credible flaw that compounds to failure. Motivation—preserve the sky—remains urgent and specific. The final renunciation (“content she had mirrored not the sky, but the act of seeking”) is earned and carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing brass, brushing dirt, aligning hopscotch angles—each action tethered to her isolation and discovery. The interior contradiction (yearning for connection yet choosing solitary charting) is dramatized, not stated. Final renunciation of rescue in favor of mapping the moment carries visible cost: she accepts continued solitude for knowledge. One slip: “tears pricked” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied ledger asterisk rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the driftwood nostalgia is felt rather than stated. The final “simply listen” choice aligns with prior motives and has visible cost in the relinquishing of force. Motivation remains character-particular and complicates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s desperation and flicker of hope are embodied in frost-scraping and hammering heartbeats; his final micro-choice to rally the colony is credible. The ghost’s motivation remains abstract, but its “strangely trustworthy” aura is dramatized through Kael’s visceral response. Secondary characters are sketched rather than crucible-tested, yet the collective shift from strangers to family is felt in the communal labor. Cost is visible in calloused hands and exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling fingers, the puppet head biting his palm—but the “thousand lifetimes” backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that tilts the present stance only once. The final choice to age decades in seconds is embodied and costly, yet the child’s plea remains abstract, blunting the contradiction that could have sharpened the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grim necessity and offhanded exactitude are embodied in micro-choices (counting steps, adjusting the nut a fraction). Interior contradiction—resentment versus oath—drives every beat. The final retrieval of the nut crystallizes her endurance with felt cost: the curse still chains her. A touch more bodily specificity under stress would nudge this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s grief is embodied through tactile ritual (kneeling, tracing foam) and anchored to his polymer lens; the interior contradiction—clinging to unbreakable chains while watching water re-braid—drives the beat that flips guilt into purpose. The final micro-choice (placing the husk, pocketing the pebble) crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Missing 9+ only because the lab-to-ravine backstory is delivered in a single dense block rather than interleaved micro-choices that tighten pressure in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradictions—fetishising emptiness vs craving fertile void—are embodied in her tactile handling of bottles and slates; the decisive shift from selling erasure to incising absence is micro-dramatized with cost, even if momentary.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—taste as memory, trembling hands, the scalding guilt—yet the apprentice’s absence on-page limits relational crucible. The final choice to distill collective remorse is earned by prior sensory logic and costs her solitude. Minor slip: “sandpaper rough memories” is repeated phrasing rather than evolving metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliska’s interiority is vivid and embodied—spectacles fogging, palms humming—yet her contradictory impulses (city apathy vs. farmer solidarity) are stated more than dramatized in-scene. The final choice to sync clock and elevator is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—engineer’s detachment vs. keeper’s empathy—surface in the tremor of his hands and the micro-choice to weep for beauty. The interior arc from detached observer to “keeper of lost light” is embodied, not labeled. The only drag is a brief “he understood then” summary that edges toward diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is elegant and embodied—"lurch in her stomach", "latent blaze of ancient purpose". Micro-choice to trace the doodle and to copy the patterns shows hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses are faint, so the arc feels lightly earned rather than wrung; renunciation is implicit but final image reframes rather than sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s interiority is embodied and specific; the porcelain insulator as tuning fork is a tactile extension of their motive. Micro-choices—rotating the insulator, strumming each fracture—reveal a hierarchy of values: empathy over preservation. The final whispered thanks shows earned cost: the sculpture will splinter, the music will die, yet the act is chosen. Flaw is the near-mythic competence that edges on wish-fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tutor’s silence-driven ethos is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (aligning the board, fingerprinting the dent) and a final renunciation of return; interior conflict between loyalty and beauty is embodied rather than told.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is distinctive—embodied through rosin-dusted fingers and tuning-fork choices—but late summary softens some beats; micro-choice chain supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—control vs. yielding—drives every beat; the shift from forcing stillness to receiving motion is embodied in micro-choices (leaving the seed, kneeling to observe). The cost is the renunciation of her prior identity as controller, felt in the final quiet smile. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—boots magnetized, grip on yoke, the cold arrow tip against pulsing warmth—yet her contradictory impulses (claim vs. listen) remain implicit rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of “trophy” for “tuning fork” is earned and carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite the slight under-drawing of internal conflict mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the fogged respirator, the cold weight of the patch, the ache of the silent town—yet her contradictory impulse (scientific detachment vs. survivor’s guilt) is more summarized than dramatized in scene. The final vow to “make the invisible visible” is earned by the preceding data and near-miss with the shifting container, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s synesthetic gift is embodied in the aurora-guided bell sequence, but interior contradiction is thin; the “certify wonder” motive is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choice. The final beat of bowing to the hush shows earned endurance, yet the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between her need to control and the emerging imperative to surrender is dramatized in the failed flute attempt and the subsequent micro-choice to listen. The final renunciation—placing the flute back—carries visible cost and is earned by prior beats. A hairline slip: “harvesting insights” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the embodied regret and tactile handling of the flute keep it from abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—yearning to quantify emotion yet recoiling from the flood of borrowed grief—are embodied in the moment they drop the fragment and choose to “carry” rather than solve. The final micro-choice (setting the harvest notice in their own breath) is earned and carries visible cost: relinquishing the shield of mathematics. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, hitched breath) and his contradictory fear/wonder impulses play out in the flower scene; the final resolve is earned by the pendant’s cost. Vanya’s absence is felt but remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted. Micro-choice—kneeling to the flower—reveals value hierarchy with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—hunger for proof vs. fear of error—drives every beat; the embodied shift from rigid certainty to humility is earned and costly. The prism’s final re-weighting as teacher rather than tool crystallizes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s longing is embodied in sticky fingers and the pulse of the amber bead; her final surrender feels earned because every beat shows the loom draining her life. The interior contradiction—clinging to hope while embracing erasure—plays out in the micro-choice to feed her own essence into the shuttle. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The flaw of obsessive perseverance is dramatized, not labeled, and the cost is the self she relinquishes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s meekness is embodied in his hunched shoulders and murmured voice, then paid for with the sacrifice of his literal voice; the interior contradiction between fear and resolve is dramatized in the moment he presses palms to silk. The cost—permanent silence—lands on the page and reconfigures his identity from passive to “azure defiance.” Minor slip: “quietly determined fire” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied beats override it.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s sensory-mapping vocation is embodied in every beat; the shard’s bite and the hydraulic arm’s near-miss anchor her interiority in physical stakes. The final renunciation—accepting Lyra’s sacrifice—earns its weight through prior sensory threads and the shard’s extinguished light. Minor slip: “crushing pressure” is slightly diagnostic, but immediately re-embodied in the closing gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her boots swallowed by the void, the sea glass “silent echo of shipwrecks.” Motivation crystallizes cleanly: bottle childhood safety. The final renunciation—abandoning the lamp for stone messages—carries visible cost, though the causal chain from reticence to this act could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, salt-crusted boots, and the “shadowed elation” that flickers between doubt and triumph. The contradiction between her dismissive mutter (“broken light means nothing”) and the visceral fear that slithers in is dramatized, not told. The final laugh that turns to relief shows earned change, though the herald’s off-page pressure keeps relationship dynamics thin.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the donor-heart beat anchors her obsession and the final renunciation feels earned. The shift from “chasing stories” to “being the calm” is credible, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete—his psoriasis ledger, the tactile brass, the moonlight on his arms—but the contradictory impulses (seeking truth vs. fearing it) are summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation is credible and costly: he abandons the quest for literal witness in favor of accepting the oak’s silent archive, a shift foreshadowed by Elias’s grief metrics. The 427-entry ledger is a strong, character-specific flaw that complicates his choices. Still, the moment of internal collision is narrated rather than shown under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—numb fingers, tear on sun-seed pods—yet the “shattered mosaic” mind remains more asserted than dramatized; the swaddling epiphany is earned but leans on a convenient memory cue rather than a visible contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her need for solitude and her fear of suffocation is dramatized in the trembling hand and the deliberate smoothing of the invitation. The final choice to stay by “truly leaving” isolation is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: the phrase “slow suffocation” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—soil-dusted hands, trembling fingers on bread crust—yet the “creeping normality noticer” label is never dramatized; her noticing is shown but not leveraged as a trait that forces a higher-stakes choice. The guilt-to-absolution arc is credible, but the final forgiveness feels slightly generalized rather than paid for by a single, costly micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices: the trembling finger above the sampler’s needle, the angled slide lock, the vellum’s iced surface under the pen. Those choices enact her interior contradiction—fear of failure vs fierce custodianship—until she seals the cryo-vial and her final bow registers the cost: silence and isolation accepted so meaning may endure. The trait is not told; it compels the measurable actions that earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile grip on the fob, the needle’s calibration, the memory of her father’s last words—yet the “curiously steadfast” trait is asserted more than embodied; her final slip through chaos is earned but the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s skepticism and scientific hunger are embodied through sensory cues (copper taste, ring warmth) and micro-choices (tightening the ring). The final realization that carriers are stewards, not anomalies, is earned by the ring’s behavior and her visceral response. Interior contradiction—desire for data versus awe—remains active in the closing beat. Cost is felt in her relinquishing of purely analytical distance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—perfect recall vs. blank page—drives every beat; the moment she kneels to repair the lock her micro-choice crystallizes the hierarchy of values (art over fear). Embodied emotion (“tears traced clean paths”) and charcoal-stained fingers ground her arc. The final sketch is earned because the lock-fix literalizes the internal repair; cost is the terror on the revealed self-portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her fear of dishonesty is embodied in wilting, her micro-choice to whisper truth to the map is character-specific, and the final blooming carries earned cost. The trait of wilting under lies constrains every beat; the moment she admits “I’m afraid the Archive is gone” and the fragment clicks is a clean causal hinge. Secondary pressure from Ben is thin but sufficient for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers tracing the bronze curve, the memory of C-sharp tension—but the seasonal muteness is asserted rather than dramatized as a live constraint. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the final renunciation (her voice for the sculpture’s song) feels slightly pre-ordained rather than freshly compelled. Micro-choices are precise, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s nostalgia is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling, recalling the tear, cradling the seed-roses—yet the interior contradiction between caretaker protocol and emergent self-preservation could be sharper under final pressure. The flaw-as-compass beat lands with cost, but the emotional layering feels slightly compressed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is present but generic; her “pulse quickened” and “hands trembled” are stock beats. The neighbors’ brief anecdotes create a collective voice rather than individual pressure on her, so her final act feels communal rather than personally costly. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; she simply proceeds once the stories align.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interiority thrums with precise contradiction: the same chill water that threatens her lungs fuels the “quiet resolve” driving her fingers. Micro-choice—“scooped up the hangman's dice… placed them gently”—crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Moment-to-moment fear is embodied, never named or therapized. Final renunciation earns its cost in the image of rising water and liberated code.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is specific—pressed wildflowers as memory anchors, salt-sting eyes, trembling hands—and his contradictory impulse (fear of forgetting vs. fear of exhuming) is dramatized in the act of scraping salt. The final renunciation—empty hands, brimming heart—earns its cost via the mother’s journal and the zero-gravity unfurling of petals. Only the mother’s voice edges toward explanatory; a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “steady fingers” and “tranquil blaze” reveal resolve under pressure—but the elders’ absence keeps status dynamics off-page, limiting relational crucible. The final renunciation (remaining solitary sentinel) is earned by the ritual’s cost, yet her flaw (solitude as both strength and sentence) could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—hunger for literal meaning vs. acceptance of shared illusion—are dramatized in her tactile handling of the seal and the micro-choice to press it to her chest. Interiority is specific and embodied; grief surfaces through jasmine scent and cool obsidian rather than labels. The final renunciation of interrogation for listening is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: Mrs. Thorne’s status dynamics remain underused.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skeptic yet charmed—drives every micro-choice; embodied tremor, steady hands, and tear tracks show simultaneous fear and resolve. The archiving ritual is a credible renunciation that costs her the memory’s immediacy, sealing independence with felt loss. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (≤20%) anchors present tactics and tilts stance; no diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tremor in her hand and the tear-ink anchor her contradictory impulses. The inherited shame and present task create credible tension, though the ancestor’s “silent plea” edges toward convenient epiphany. The final renunciation—lighter burden, not absolution—earns its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaela’s hunger to understand echoes is viscerally rooted in her vanished brother; every sensory intake vibrates with that motive. Her contradictory wish to sing yet stay unseen surfaces in “Let them,” a micro-choice that crystallizes risk. Yet the Council remains a disembodied menace and Renn a cipher, limiting relationship crucible; internal stakes outweigh external contact.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s contradictory need to pry open guilty ghosts while insisting on “something pure” is embodied in gut-level detail—she kneels on subzero stone till her knees ache, her fingers still stinging with brine from the dive. Micro-decisions (choosing whose dream fragment to track, laying the globe into the niche with reverence that costs secrecy) externalize the clash between moral clarity and inherited shame. Her final whisper of thanks is earned; the choice is refusal-to-condemn coupled with acceptance of their shared fall, and the trembling in her exhale makes the cost palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kenji’s interiority is vivid and embodied—calloused fingers, breath catching, resonance in bones—yet the final renunciation (brewing tea as ritual, not drink) is foreshadowed only by abstract reverence; the cost is felt but not dramatized as a concrete forfeiture, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s drive to “excavate truth” is embodied in every micro-choice—scanning trunks, kneeling to brush grit, using the diamond as a sorting surface. The interior contradiction between her rational dismissal of “curses” and the visceral weight of the stone is dramatized, not labeled. The final renunciation—leaving the diamond yet carrying the letters—earns its cost through prior causality and visibly forecloses the path of comfortable ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart hammered against her ribs”), her contradictory impulses (faith in Prophet vs. new evidence) play out in real time, and her final choice to weaponize the Portico is earned by prior causality. The cost—loss of her last illusion and exposure to the sky-cutter—is legible on the page. Minor slip: “etched into her bones” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s yearning to “translate between generations” is embodied in the glass-jar archive and the final act of capturing the child’s hum; the contradiction between isolation and communion is dramatized, not stated. The moment he offers the lullaby without words crystallizes his hierarchy of values—memory over speech, gift over transaction—at visible emotional cost. Interiority is specific and embodied (“bones aching with the cold seeped from the dune earth”). Minor slip: the girl’s interiority is ventriloquized (“slow, wondering smile”) without dramatized cue.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“a physical ache in his molars”), motives escalate under pressure, and the final renunciation—pouring his will into the key—carries visible cost. The single flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“logically emotional response”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “breath a soft plume,” her ear catching the lake’s “high, thin note”—and her contradictory impulses (urgent revolution vs. patient erosion) are dramatized in the moment she calms the hammer-wielding youth. The final renunciation of force carries visible cost: the shard of chain she cradles is “cool and light,” a tangible forfeiture of her own urgency. Minor slip: the elders’ opposition is reported rather than embodied, slightly blunting status pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—compliance vs. ancestral defiance—drives every beat; the lantern’s legacy crystallizes her final micro-choice to risk her career. Embodied emotion (phantom chill, hand on wall) anchors memory surges without label-speak. Motivation escalates from quiet guilt to explicit rebellion, cost legible in the decision to file against orders.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Father Michael’s guilt and mission crystallize through embodied micro-choices—hands that “learned patience in death-row visits,” the clench when the music starts. His contradictory impulse (carry Elias’s failure vs. accept Elias’s absolution) plays out in real time, culminating in the tear-pricked smile that accepts his own pardon. The cost is visible: he must drive through the night bearing the literal ticking proof of grace. Minor slip: Mrs. Gable’s interiority is asserted rather than dramatized, but she is secondary.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zephyr’s relentless curiosity and embodied physics-experiments body every beat; from arrow-tip sensor to leap into Whisper, interior motive reveals irreconcilable hope vs. indifferent sea. Flaws (hubristic tinkering, cavalier awe) compound real cost when the bell demands unquantified yearning. Final renunciation—that seeking itself was the bell—feels like tissue torn from Zephyr’s chest.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s single-minded drive to find Leo is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to lie to Vance crystallizes stakes. Interiority stays concrete, but the final beat (“Now you know”) lands as statement rather than earned cost, blunting the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s calm intuition and shadow-thread skin are vividly embodied; the shards of empathy compel each micro-choice. One break: Kael’s interior is told, not shown when his fist “trembles,” but the cost is dramatized on the ice and suffices for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet laboring to hear endings—are embodied in the shovel’s scrape and the parasol’s sting; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost as she trades escape for presence. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The fold in patience bends rather than breaks, earning the earned stasis of listening without flinching.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the ache beneath her ribs and the gravel biting her knees ground her longing. The micro-choice to keep the letter, re-framing the burn-edge as survival rather than loss, earns a credible shift. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “strangely honest” nature is dramatized when she feels the clearing’s fear and the parapet’s weariness. The final choice—to weave herself into the clearing—carries visible exhaustion as cost. One slip: the phrase “strangely honest eyes” leans label-adjacent, though the surrounding embodiment rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her micro-choices (handing her own grief-photo to Leo, emptying the case) crystallize her arc. The contradictory impulse—clutching versus releasing pain—drives the closure. No headcount issues; secondary figures apply pressure via photographs rather than on-page presence. One hairline slip: “perceptively calm” edges toward diagnostic label.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s lifelong “weathered innocence” and her tactile need to prove words alive are specific and embodied. But because no second character is on-stage the pressure must come from her interior choices; the scene risks becoming pure attunement rather than choice. Her final act—cradling the cooled crystal and refusing a treatise—qualifies as Earned Stasis and is rooted in prior discoveries, but the emotional cost registers more as residue than as a sharp change. She reaches 7.8: vivid but slightly under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—yearning to bottle time while doomed to forget—drives every micro-choice; the trembling chalk, the palm on driftwood, the scramble after the plink all embody the cost. Yet the final amnesiac beat feels slightly under-cooked: we see the loss but not the fresh wound it carves in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the luminous ache and clock-hand obsession are specific. The shift from resisting tremors to harmonizing with them is earned and costly. Minor slip: “escape velocity” epiphany edges toward label-speak before it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her micro-choice to insist on the rooftop and her tactile handling of the vinyl shard reveal motive under pressure. Aris’s silent tear and air-tracing gesture show earned change without exposition. The only gap is that “decisively kind” is asserted more than dramatized in conflict with staff.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused thumb, steady breath, sweat bead—while her quiet ache for Varn and planetary stakes coexist without contradiction. Micro-choices (chisel angle, key tension) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting Varn became guardian, not victim—earns closure with visible cost: she lays the key beside the shadow-shard, foreclosing reunion. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphany intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. wonder—is embodied in the tactile handling of the tooth and crystallizes in her decision to plant it as a beacon; the cost of her former certainty is felt. Finn’s shrewd innocence pressures her in-scene, forcing the micro-choice to share the story of the ivy gate. Minor slip: “shrewdly innocent” is used twice as label rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her shattered dreams and her earthbound purpose is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (weighing glass, polishing). The final renunciation—offering light without fire—earns its cost via the remembered funeral shard and the tremor in her hands. Minor slip: the phrase “gloriously, gently aloft” edges toward tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the amber pendant’s shift from chain to bridge is dramatized through micro-choice. The final gesture with Mara crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: “fossilized in resin” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—collecting hopes while fearing erasure—remains embodied and specific; the shift from hoarding to release is earned through tactile micro-choices (shell warming, trembling hands). The final renunciation carries visible cost: he walks away with “quiet certainty” rather than possession. No stock labels or therapy-speak intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied through tactile micro-choices (cradling the vine, fumbling the stone). Internal contradiction is hinted at (panic vs resolve) but never crystallizes into a visible flaw that complicates the final act; the cost is felt but not tied to a personal limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—scarred hands, frost-numbed breath, the tactile dread of flash-paper—yet her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. renunciation) stay mostly summary until the final sealing. The cost of mapping Lina’s heartbeat is felt in the wax of “frozen tears,” but the micro-choice that exposes this cost arrives late, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her grief is never labeled, only felt in the “hollowed” space and the steadiness of her hands while tears threaten. The contradiction between grief and logical anchor is dramatized in the moment she chooses to tune the prism rather than indulge memory. The final act of bottling Silas’s laughter carries visible cost: she forecloses the chance to hear it again. One minor slip: “store wonder in the cellar of reason” is slightly thesis-like, though it is offset by immediate sensory follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her contradictory impulses (collect burdens vs. calcify her own) are embodied in the tactile ritual—but the “fractal weaver” label is never dramatized; it remains ornamental. The final smile is earned because the prior beats show her accepting the cost of adding her own regret to the satchel.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The widow’s interiority is embodied in the weight of the ash blank and the first cut; her contradictory need to both keep and release Elias drives the carving. Micro-choice—setting the knife to wood—forecloses avoidance and costs the tear that lands on the shavings. Motivation is rooted in grief yet practical, avoiding therapy-speak. The arc from raw absence to shaped memory is earned and visible in the emerging figure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s regret and scavenger drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices (kneeling, pocketing shards), but the interior contradiction between hope and erosion is more summarized than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation lands with felt cost yet leans on abstract phrasing (“hollow certainty”) rather than a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara blends diligent engineer’s logic with stoic wonder: her tactile interaction with the sextant and the low hum of revived machinery feel personally specific and goal-driven. Interior contradiction—hope versus degradation—is embodied in dust-choked sparks and grease-streaked fingers. The ending earns her grim, gleeful endurance when she pockets the brass fragment as “a compass pointing to possibility.” Small risk: her curiosity edges toward convenient competence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—perfectionist dream vs. caretaker reality—is embodied in micro-choices (lowering the oiler, gentling his satchel). The bear encounter crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost: he releases the ghost of the Eternal Chronometer. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present stance. Only the repeated “excruciatingly gentle” edges toward label-speak, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is legible and consistent; the interiority is concrete, and the final renunciation of “ghost-chasing” for archival dismantling is earned. Yet the emotional register stays coolly analytical—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the turn feels more intellectual than visceral. Competence is high, but genuine struggle is largely off-stage, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s patience is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing knots, adjusting fulgurite) and visibly costs him numb hands and time; the final binding of rope to seed tin is a credible renunciation that forecloses inaction. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s emotional contradiction between mapping absence and yearning for connection is embodied and earned; her final crystallization of healing as witness is a credible renunciation with felt cost that matches story length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s obsession is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between hope and the sterility of his world is dramatized in every micro-choice. The final renunciation—accepting broken beauty—carries a felt cost that is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: “quaking reverie” edges toward label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven penance vs. life-affirming nurture—are embodied in the tactile grafting scene; the coin talisman and black sand act as concrete extensions of her inner split. Motivation remains rooted and escalates to the final “harmony” choice, with visible cost (soot-stained lungs, sweat, emotional tear). Minor slip: “unyielding compassion” is named rather than dramatized once.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction (luminous skeptic) remains active across every beat; final stance crystallization carries the price of seventeen years of vigilance and her first unsuppressed tears. Motives are concrete and embodied through tactile search and micro-kneel at the basin.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her translucent shimmer, crystallizing tears, and tactile reverence for the gear embody her contradictory impulses. The generational vow and her micro-choice to slot the gear into the sonar crystallize her stance, foreclosing the path of fire with visible cost. The final touch of the gear feels earned, though the “troubling serenity” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is embodied—limestone on skin, grit in breath—and his contradictory pull between solitary stone-craft and communal memory is staged through each ribbon he ties. Corvin’s spectral presence presses him toward shared ritual; the interplay of regret and resolve is specific, never summary. The micro-choice to turn stone-carved loss into a living butterfly vessel pays off the established flaw: he “carves only individual sorrow,” yet ends with collective grief in motion. Final cost is visible in the mingling of tears and limestone.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt-driven precision and embodied grief anchor every micro-choice; the rake-handle inscriptions crystallize his incremental absolution into measurable action. Interior contradiction—duty vs. self-reproach—drives the final chisel stroke. Cost is felt when he trades lifelong penance for a restored town rhythm. Only the brother’s off-stage presence keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “tenderly organized” precision, the soil-stained fingers, the gardener’s reflex to smooth the tapestry edge all root motive in tactile habit. The final recognition that Silas wove the warning threads is earned by her micro-choices under pressure, and the cost (the weight of remembrance) is felt. Minor slip: “blithe spirit” flirts with label-speak, but the embodied actions override it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—frost on glass, mineral scent, feather’s hum—yet the “ignorance cartographer” conceit is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the final resolve feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. desperation—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of silence is earned by her prior risk-taking and embodied in the glowing dust. The “copyist” trait is not label but muscle memory that alters tactics. Cost is felt when she folds the fresh parchment, knowing dawn patrols still threaten.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tracing the mask, the throat-tightening awe—yet the final renunciation (“leaving the gallery to its quiet end”) feels slightly under-motivated; the mask’s weight is noted but never forces a micro-choice that costs her something visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Phil’s “rationally rebellious” stance is embodied in the tactile spoon-work and the silent confrontation with Kael; the interior contradiction between preservation and futility is palpable. Yet the final beat feels more posture than choice—he places the cog back but no new option is foreclosed, so the cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ms. Thorne’s interiority is textured—her tactile tracing of the rosette, the “expectantly resigned” stance, and the micro-choice to shift rehearsal from singing to silence all feel earned. The contradiction between her pride in past harmony and present despair is embodied rather than labeled. Cost is visible: she forfeits the immediate gratification of a quick fix for the slow labor of listening. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories through tomatoes and blackberries—but the synaptic-plasticity exposition edges into diagnostic label-speak, blunting the final beat. Her contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) are embodied in pruning cuts and seed planting, yet the cost of her vigilance is more asserted than felt. The grandmother quote is a touch too tidy, but the micro-choice to whisper apologies to ghosts earns the quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s involuntary truth compulsion is embodied in the throat-tightening beat and the forced confession; her micro-choice to hand the stranger the literal riddle shows a hierarchy of values (wonder over safety) with visible cost. Interiority is specific—tracing dust on glass, the cool lacquer grounding her—but the stranger remains a device, not a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. The final renunciation (enduring the dark to keep wonder alive) is earned by prior causality and lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her tactile handling of the orris root and the deliberate placement of displaced objects reveal a hierarchy of values—curiosity tempered by compassion. The final tear-touched moment on Finnegan’s porch earns her arc: she moves from detached observer to active caretaker, paying the cost of emotional exposure. Minor slip: the phrase “inadvertently profound” is stated rather than dramatized, a label rather than a lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aelius’s interior contradiction (“incisively kind” vs centuries-old grievance) is embodied—the stiff flex of crystalline fingers, the warm ampoule against cold water. His shift from vindictive sentinel to mourner of nuance is earned micro-choice by micro-choice (thread guided, fish calmed). The stone-lip smile that ends the story is both earned and visibly felt, foreclosing the path of retribution. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps relational dynamics untested.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s grim optimism is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thumb on the chipped die, whispered axiom, final descent—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction (math vs regret) is dramatized, not summarized, and the Earned Stasis of turning away from the void carries visible cost. Minor slip: “balancedly daring” is asserted more than enacted until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s insomniac painter identity infuses interiority and motive, but turns depend more on theme than character-specific contradictions. His methodical hope stays consistent rather than evolving under pressure, limiting earned change. Emotional embodiment is vivid, yet choices feel pre-ordained by concept.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s desperation to save the archives is palpable and embodied; her micro-choice to repurpose the bread baskets crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The contradiction between scholarly detachment and frantic action is dramatized, not summarized. Cost is visible in the trembling hands of Old Man Varen and the soaked parchments.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her oil-stained fingers, the cold stone floor, the hum in her palms—but the final leap from “tuning” to “stepping beyond fate” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—her terror of death and her compulsion to confront it—are embodied in trembling hands and the camera’s shutter. The clasp’s pulse and the whispered paradoxes externalize her interiority without therapy-speak. Her final self-photograph crystallizes a credible renunciation: she trades the curse for agency, paying with the last glow of the heirloom. The cost is visible and scaled to the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile mapping and the whistle test; the final resolve to walk the revealed path is earned by years of pattern study and the immediate crack. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the reed whistle as inherited burden complicates his choice. The only minor drag is a brief “ghost of the lost expedition” summary that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s emotionally rational stance is embodied in micro-choices—calmly reassembling wind-scattered papers, tracing the letter’s border—yet the interior contradiction between sorrow and resolve remains more asserted than dramatized. The final resolve to confront the council is credible but arrives via summary rather than a visible, costly micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is concrete ("hands calloused") and contradictions appear ("stoically sensitive"). The climax’s choice—to embed memory within stone while accepting inevitable loss—arises from the stated desire and embodied cost of surfacing in weighted boots. Still, motivation drifts toward thematic articulation ("archeologist of abandoned dreams"), a faint therapy-label at peak tension that blunts the 8-barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s indexing motive and quiet resolve are embodied through tactile micro-choices (finger-tracing, stamp pressure tests). The shift from passive observer to active re-indexer is earned by concrete discoveries; cost is the forfeiture of the official narrative she once served. Interiority stays specific and sensorial, never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, scalding tears, knuckles whitening on the cloth—yet the “fold grief into cranes” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final crane becomes hope. The micro-choice to keep polishing despite psychic agony crystallizes her hierarchy of values and earns the ending’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Grief-driven interior monologue is raw and specific, but some “unused potential” abstractions soften contradictory impulses; geode as tactile memory anchor keeps motive visceral. One strong renunciation beat—the decision to map pools rather than merely mourn—lands with felt cost as he logs coordinates inside the warming stone’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s yearning for “the frequency of belonging” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—her trembling hands, the chip’s warmth—yet the interior contradiction between drone-honed precision and raw awe is only asserted, not dramatized in-scene. The final alignment reads as earned because her prior solitude is made visceral, but the flaw of perpetual surprise never visibly complicates her timing or decision, keeping the arc just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s guilt is embodied in tactile ritual and micro-choice (kneeling, sifting, fist closing on the watch hand). The contradictory impulse—seeking truth he once buried—drives every beat, culminating in Earned Stasis: he renounces further fabrication, the cost etched in his bleeding palm. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interiority is textured and embodied; the brass pull anchors guilt without lapsing into label-speak. The contradiction between protocol and personal loss drives every beat, culminating in the micro-choice to release Vanya. The cost—his own unabsolved guilt—remains palpable. Only the envoy’s blankness keeps the relationship crucible from full ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses—yearning for absolution vs. clinging to the sea—are embodied in every paddle stroke; the compass’s loss and the phone’s reach dramatize the cost of choosing presence. Interiority is specific, salted with nautical idiom and regret, though a few “merrily melancholic” tags edge toward label-speak. The final micro-choice to beach and call earns the renunciation with visible throat-tightening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. hope—are embodied in the choice to risk drowning rather than take the dry path; the girl’s tear crystallizes a visible cost. Interiority is specific (“ghost of his dirty past…clung to his skin like grime”) and avoids therapy-speak. The baseball’s transfer is a micro-choice that re-orders his hierarchy of values. Minor: the girl’s interiority is inferred, not dramatized, keeping her slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s yearning for Kaelen anchors every beat; her grief is embodied in tactile spice-crushing and moonlit silence, and her final renunciation earns heartbreaking resonance. Interior contradiction pulses in every sensory detail; no stasis or label-speak. Arc from companion to cosmic witness is earned by causal spice-memory, foreclosing physical reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning motherhood while fixated on cartomantic coin—drives every choice from palm-ink to cloud-flight; her embodied remorse in the final handprint on cloth and the visible cost of lost/exhumed time all land with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifism is embodied in her refusal to fight the grasping shadows, yet the interior contradiction—her need to act violently to liberate—remains abstract rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The final embrace of her own death-wish shadow is moving but compressed into summary, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s interiority is embodied and consistent, but the “accidental prophecy” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; the final renunciation of empire is felt yet leans summary, not micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bronze quill holder’s weight and notches anchor her lineage and tactical ingenuity. The moment she rotates the gnomon crystallizes her contradictory impulses—loyalty to post versus duty to revolution—with a tactile, irreversible cost. One slip from 9.0: the “calmly inventive” label is asserted rather than dramatized in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—fighting the curse vs. using it—drives every micro-choice; the final surrender is embodied in the crimson stone placement and costs him the illusion of control. Emotions are salted sweat and frozen breath, never labels. Backstory (Old Mara’s deathbed) is brief, concrete, and tilts the present tactic. The shift from “herder of eels” to “herder of moments” is earned, visible, and carries felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—scar-tracing, timer-clicking, envelope-pressing—each micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values (truth over safety). Motivation (mapping scars) is clear and intensifies through escalating storm pressure. Final renunciation of timetable for internal map is earned, with visible cost (first uncensored line). Slight deduction for near-therapy framing of “cartography of pain” in reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s mechanical-arm-as-constant-reminder and his micro-choices under duel pressure (using each lunge to realign for the sundial reading) make motivation kinetic; the interior contradiction between quoting Heraclitus and parrying steel is dramatized, not declared. The foil-to-card pivot shows a hierarchy of values—treaty over pride—yet the cost (arm jolt, risk of death) is present but not deeply felt, capping short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—trembling Scribe vs. defiant Architect—is dramatized in the moment he presses the new verse into the tin; the embodied shiver of moonlight on skin and the tactile memory of Mateo’s gift give motive force. The monthly molt is more label than lived constraint, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “remembering melodies long silenced” and the “steely longing” that hardens into resolve—but the final beat withholds her immediate reaction to Leo’s re-coalescence, blunting the cost of her choice. The contradiction between despair and strategic creativity is dramatized through her sonic mimicry of the clock’s pulse, yet the absence of a visible emotional toll at the climax caps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor versus luminous doubt—is embodied in every beat; the final renunciation of certainty carries a felt cost when she whispers thanks to the dreamers. Lyra’s child-voice is distinct, her inherited lullaby a credible conduit of memory. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: data fork vs. dream song. No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kai’s interiority is embodied and specific—his trembling fingers on the lace, the sap tear—yet the final renunciation (“This cut… for the words I didn’t say”) lands with earned cost. The contradiction between pride and longing is dramatized, not summarized. One minor slip: “cerulean regret in his chest” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied ache.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels through embodied choices (kneeling to read frost patterns), but "purpose in the pauses" motivation borders on abstraction despite bruise/vial embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses shine in Elara's frustration tightening her throat yet persisting with the resonator; the botanist's thermal shift (crimson to gold) embodies earned cost through visible tears, avoiding diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (burial vs. restoration) manifests in physical choices; embodied exhaustion grounds stubbornness. "Worn smooth by exhaustion" risks abstraction but saved by concrete actions like repurposing tools.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's "gently persistent" motivation drives tangible micro-choices (bell use, declaration) with embodied cost ("ache in his chest easing"), though secondary characters like Marta serve primarily as functional anchors rather than fully conflicted individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during climax; past-life regret drives action but no competing present-tense conflict emerges when releasing the love. Micro-choices like breath control reveal values, but the 9+ gate fails due to unidirectional emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Contradictory impulses (scientist's curiosity vs. paternal grief) act simultaneously in the climax; final renunciation of photos earns closure with visceral cost ("hollow where memories used to be"). No therapy-speak—emotions embodied through tactile details like "trembling fingers" and "heart hammered".

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strength: Contradictory impulses shine in "staggering grace" during collapse. Weakness: "her motivation burned clear" uses label-language violating embodied emotion rule, costing 0.4 in peak pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in her scientific precision versus emotional vulnerability ("splinter in her soul"), embodied through micro-choices like attaching the component to hydrophones. Yet the betrayal reflection remains slightly detached from present action, lacking a micro-choice that visibly alters her current tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in "heart hammered... not from fear of capture, but from desperate need," with micro-choices like thermal-expansion trick revealing embodied expertise; only minor flaw is limited internal conflict beyond grief/hope duality during high-stakes decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation for "safe zones" slightly abstract; villagers mentioned but not dramatized. Final abandonment choice earns closure through physical crisis, though thematic resonance could tighten. Contradictory impulses (grief/joy) embodied via theatrical narration of mundane tasks.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.5)
    Maya's contradictory impulses—fear vs. adaptive resolve—act simultaneously in decoding scenes; her final choice to send evidence earns rebirth through prior causality (cast as proof, cipher breakthrough) with visceral cost (aquaphobia confrontation).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation clear but interior contradiction underdeveloped; "mildly obsessed" trait lacks visible tradeoffs despite strong embodied emotion ("fingers stained with ink and salt"). Final choice earned but micro-choices don't reveal layered values.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through loop failures (shattering vs. melting violin) and "urgency/composure" tension, but emotional layering lacks visceral physicality beyond "burned with quiet urgency"—more embodied struggle needed in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (observer/participant) drive micro-choices under pressure; musicians' embodied conflict shows status dynamics via hovering hand/strap adjustment. Slightly weakened by summarized "years of professional jealousy" rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation ("gardens know their gardeners") drives every micro-choice, with contradictory impulses (embracing cracks while fighting entropy) embodied in her polishing ritual. Flawless interiority avoids therapy-speak; the final marble placement earns closure through decades of mended deceptions made visible. "Pragmatic wisdom" hint slightly tells but redeemed by concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (obliging duty vs secret passion) drive the lever pull; embodied emotion in "tears freezing on cheeks" avoids diagnostic labels. Slight tell in "years of ridicule" summary lacks specific micro-choice anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation rooted in musician's specific traits; micro-choices like guiding water droplets reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final choice to carry the program earns visible cost as "burden and gift," though "lately inspired" lacks deeper integration into actions.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines (analytical mind vs. embodied grief), but "fault-tolerant lattice" verges on diagnostic label-speak; micro-choice of smudging the illustration powerfully reveals values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interior contradiction underdeveloped; skepticism-to-acceptance shift lacks layered irrationality. "Crushing lightness of a lie" triggers diagnostic label penalty in climax. Micro-choices like radio tuning reveal values but emotional progression feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in panic vs vow; embodied emotion in "breathless" emergence and "frantic grip" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of preservation is earned through witnessing transformation, with cost legible in "Eastern Codices were gone." No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's motivation to nurture wonder avoids clinical tropes, but Leo's anxiety resolution lacks contradictory impulses; his "chronic anxiety" vanishing via one flute note feels unearned despite embodied tremors early on.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation clear but under-dramatized; "sensitively perceptive" trait lacks embodied cost or contradictory impulses. Final synthesis choice feels inevitable rather than earned through prior struggle. Strength lies in concrete tools ("filament-thin manipulator") but emotional layers remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's yearning for change ("transpose life into a new key") conflicts with duty, driving her decisive beam adjustment; exhaustion and identity shift manifest visible cost without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority shows focused faith under pressure but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices (brush dip, question selection) reveal values yet flaw remains the town's collective ignorance, not Anselm's personal struggle. Final belief shift feels externally imposed rather than earned through his internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction ("chronologically homesick" vs. present mission) and embodied exhaustion strengthen motivation, but fortune cookie backstory lacks causal weight in choices; "hollow phrases" mention feels decorative rather than driving current stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through simultaneous fear/arrogance ghosts, but "motivation burned fierce" uses label without embodiment, triggering minor diagnostic penalty despite otherwise concrete choices like walking through younger self.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s numbness manifests in concrete tactile details ("defeat tasted like dust," "rhythms flat against her skin") with contradictory impulses (discarding vs. repurposing the needle) driving her pivotal choice. Silas’ silent arrival and shared vibration experience deepen the relationship crucible without dialogue, embodying emotional progression through palm-on-wall micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.5)
    Contradictory impulses (solitude vs. duty) manifest in micro-choices like lateral pacing and coded message revision; final endurance of risk feels earned through embodied stakes ("pulse quickened," unlocked gate) without diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines: scientific precision ("ultraviolet frequencies") clashes with raw grief ("phantom ache of tears").

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Embodied contradiction shines: fear of shattering peace vs. faith in imperfect resonance, crystallized when unbinding violin becomes releasing fear. Micro-choices under pressure (dipping bowl, tuning warped strings) reveal hierarchy of values. No second character limits relationship crucible but single-POV baseline excels.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—profiting from emotional fraud while seeking why people crave it—drive her closure choice to leave space for real healing. Embodied emotion via static mapping grief’s architecture avoids therapy-speak; micro-choices like testing petal integrity reveal professional hierarchy of values. Minor abstraction in "quiet, persistent drive" slightly dilutes early specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strength: Micro-choice of writing "Project Silent Currents" in contract notebook reveals Aris's value hierarchy shift. Weakness: Internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; regret-to-empathy shift feels sequential, not layered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)

Hemlock’s silent participation lacks tactical impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines when frustration over "hollow" moth illustrations contrasts with rhythmic urgency; embodied exhaustion post-crisis ("Exhaustion hit") avoids therapy-speak. Slight over-reliance on pendant as emotional barometer weakens micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority avoids diagnostic labels through embodied vectors ("violet grief threads") and micro-choices (aligning glass eyes with mosaic chips).

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (e.g., handling tape "like a sleeping child" while pulse quickens), avoiding epiphanies. Final visibility earned via prior causality—Elara's quiet act forecloses ghostly existence with felt cost in Mrs. Gable's gasp.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority anchored in concrete action ("hands shook with exhaustion") avoids epiphany clichés, but "wryly earnest belief" edges toward abstract label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in the moment.

    Interiority strong but epiphany lacks struggle; "bright darkness" label triggers diagnostic penalty. Pilgrim's voice lacks distinction despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (grief/hope) act in scene via embodied micro-choices—e.g., steadying hands while chest tremors during valve repair. Motivation rooted in archivist role’s visceral cost (salt-sting skin, reactive visions), though exile backstory’s stakes lack early friction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (mapping others vs. avoiding his grief) drives the climax; embodied emotion in "pressed the punch into his palm" avoids therapy-speak. Backstory integration slightly summary-like when mother's voice echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction (skepticism vs inherited duty) drives micro-choices like pocketing then using the tile; embodied fear ("knuckles white") and calf memory layer authentically. Change feels earned but the overnight shift from "scoffing" to risking reputation lacks sufficient friction in the final confrontation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority vividly concrete ("boredom settled into his bones like sediment") and motivation crystallizes through embodied micro-choices (recalling city consumed by amulet). Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during climax—hesitation feels sequential rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's interior contradiction—craving fairness while inheriting con-artist brilliance—drives her calculus authentically. Silas remains off-page, weakening the relationship crucible; his "moral rot" feels asserted, not embodied through active friction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation crystallizes through tactile details ("cool silk of vanished afternoon"), but "invented histories" label risks over-articulation during peak stress; embodied contradiction (studious focus vs. aching connection) earns high band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in "adrift" yet actively stitching fragments; final choice as archivist earned by tactile progression from hollow ache to etching stories. Slight abstraction in "seeking patterns" prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.5)
    Interior contradiction shines: Aris’s skepticism as "reverence" wars with his myth-busting identity, embodied in the shell’s shift from "silent mockery" to compass. Micro-choices—pressing ear to cello, adjusting bow—reveal hierarchy of values (grief vs. hope) with visceral cost ("hollow ache" lifting). No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression layers irrationality (debunker seeking magic) organically.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's contradictory impulses (mediate vs protect) act simultaneously in scene; final choice to reorganize is earned by his shock absorber role with visible cost ("they won't stop privatization"). No diagnostic label-speak even under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's embodied motivation ("restore shared balance") drives action, but Tomas/Mara lack contradictory impulses; Finn's restlessness resolves too neatly without visible cost escalation during the walk.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Embodied panic ("trembling hand," "muscles coiled to bolt") and contradictory impulses (flight instinct vs. priestess-guided stillness) earn the final choice. Minor deduction for "lonesome splendor" bordering on thematic label in peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction shines in "I am not my father" micro-choices, but embodied emotion lacks specificity; "suffocating echo" leans abstract when concrete sensory details would heighten the inherited lie's physical weight during the hover sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ghost bride’s motivation manifests through action: reviving vine while blackening thorns embodies "healing and harm." Silas’ embodied grief ("tears freezing on his cheeks") avoids therapy-speak. Backstory fragment anchors present stakes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) drive her sewing choice with embodied cost: "fingers bled" and path fragility. Interiority avoids therapy-speak via concrete sensory anchors like "tears cutting tracks through canyon dust," fulfilling 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in "purposeful wandering" versus urgency; embodied emotion in "toe struck something solid" reveals character under pressure. Final choice earned by prior observation beats. Slight abstraction in "faith" concept prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—clinging to obsolete rituals while decoding marginal meaning—drives the pivotal juxtaposition beat. Embodied emotion (“knee ache,” trembling clipboard) avoids stock phrasing, though the epiphany slightly edges toward convenience despite credible setup.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (fumbling thimble while counting seconds); embodied tension peaks when "heart hammered" but she forces clumsy panic. Final renunciation of safety—stitching the flame—earns closure with visible cost in trembling candle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction ("shrewdly innocent" trait) manifests in decoding child's cipher when medics dismiss it; embodied emotion avoids labels via coral's "porous labyrinth holding ocean memories" and "pulse beneath [wound]"; final renunciation of survivor guilt earned through Lantau reef parallel.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority vivid but "pensive mirth" violates anti-pattern for therapy-speak in peak beats; otherwise strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure like loading flawed film.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (certainty vs curiosity) act simultaneously in the pivotal pause; her final renunciation of "cage of certainty" is earned by the nickel’s tactile presence and visible cost in abandoning "safety of knowing." Visitor’s thinness slightly weakens relationship crucible.

    Strong embodied emotion ("foxglove regret thick as dust") and credible endurance earn closure, but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; micro-choices reveal values yet internal conflict remains linear under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses shine: "carefully reckless energy" hums while she "tempered exhilaration with caution."

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (longing vs. prophecy) act simultaneously in high-stakes glyph-drawing; final renunciation of physical form earns closure through prior observation of gaps, with cost in "vessel emptied of its burden."

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction shines in Kai’s isolation versus shared grief realization; embodied emotion via porcelain box handling avoids therapy-speak. Final choice earned through scarred hands’ micro-choices, though reflection density slightly overshadows present tension.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)

    Interior contradiction vividly embodied: exhaustion versus resolve manifests in "tremor in hands" and ritualistic composure. Micro-choices (tracing clipboard edge) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. No diagnostic labels; "words ash in her mouth" shows cost better than tells. Near-flawless but "ghosts of failed talks" slightly abstract for peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s contradictory impulses (ruthless scarcity engineer vs. secret sentimental core) act simultaneously in the egg-placing scene, with his boyhood feather memory altering his present stance. Lena’s presence applies secondary pressure but lacks sufficient development to fully test their relationship state; her skepticism-to-softening arc feels abbreviated without a concrete tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interior contradiction under pressure is thin; "chaste defiance was not absence but presence" veers into diagnostic label-speak during climax, undermining embodied conflict despite strong micro-choices in thread-untangling.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied details (breath fogging eyepiece, pen warmth) and contradictory impulses (corporate caution vs journalistic courage).

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation ("sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'") is concrete and tied to conductor's dismissal, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—yearning dominates without competing doubts.
