  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's internal contradiction between scientific detachment and emerging emotional connection drives genuine change, with the orchid-to-weed transfer moment embodying his shift. The final choice to "join the process" is earned through accumulated perception, though some interior phrasing ("profound sense of connection") edges toward telling rather than embodying.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's transformation from artist to reader of natural patterns is earned through embodied details like her shaking hands at the new kiln. The internal contradiction between fearing fire and needing creation drives authentic choices. Minor deduction for the smugglers' motivation feeling slightly convenient, though the mistaken observation works.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to translate silence into music drives concrete choices throughout, with her trauma from the capsize creating genuine internal conflict between fear and persistence. The transformation of her terror into art shows earned change with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("profound peace") in resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through the "psychic static that frayed the edges of his world," with his weariness etched physically. The contradiction between his death-work and his desperate need for silence creates genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "inadvertently stubborn" trait that lacks specific embodiment in action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's progression from survival-focused leader to community builder shows clear internal contradiction between immediate need and long-term hope, with the bell discovery forcing a choice between secrecy and shared memory. The final decision to publicly declare the garden project demonstrates earned change with visible cost (exposure risk). Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("oppressive nights," "achingly familiar") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's spiritual curiosity drives concrete action through the camera obscura method, with embodied breathing creating real stakes. The phantom limb metaphor for lost connection is specific and visceral. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "pilgrim of sparks" label that doesn't fully integrate with character psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives every choice, from building the hyperbolic maze to handling the fragment despite its consuming effect. His internal conflict between holding and releasing the fragment manifests physically ("clutched the fragment in his pocket now, its soft thrum a constant, terrifying comfort"). The final renunciation—using the maze's geometry to dissolve the fragment—carries visible cost as he loses all memories but gains freedom from temporal prison.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's patient strategic mind and decade-long endurance create a coherent character whose final action—orchestrating automated chaos to protect the seed vault—feels earned through established traits. The contradiction between physical bondage and purposeful agency operates throughout, with micro-choices (reordering keys, activating defenses) revealing her hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's synesthetic gift and obsessive pursuit are embodied through concrete sensory details ("bass note" of moss, "high-pitched chime" of scales). His motivation to capture "the sound of trust breaking" drives every action, and the final choice to transform pain into "the shape of its absence" shows genuine character evolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is beautifully particular ("to press your ear against destiny's door") and his transformation from past-oriented to future-oriented is earned through concrete experience with the moonbeams. The character shows genuine internal conflict when confronting the jar, and his final stance as "custodian of possibilities" carries visible cost - his portraits now seem "flat" and "inert." Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in processing such a paradigm shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's theatrical narration as psychological armor against grief creates genuine complexity, and her final choice to abandon her art carries visible cost. The frozen/thawing heart metaphor drives concrete choices throughout, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("The memory, frozen for years, began to liquefy").

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied fear ("acrophobia making my stomach lurch") and contradictory impulses between programmed identity and emerging self. The final choice to use vulnerability as weapon is earned through prior discovery. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("aching vulnerability") but the transformation from broken puppet to architect lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—his "mild obsession" to map darkness through silence manifests in concrete ritual actions. The internal experience is richly embodied through sensory perception of different silences ("heavy and saline," "thin and sharp as a shard of ice"). Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the character's goal, though it's grounded in specific physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit 734's motivation to "find where thoughts come from" drives consistent action through 8,192 loops, with the final choice to interface directly showing contradictory impulses (system warnings vs. curiosity). The earned revelation about thoughts coming from "ghosts we carry" lands with emotional specificity, though the character's internal experience could be more embodied during the interface moment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior contradiction between yearning for transparency and inability to find "honest words" drives the piece. The final choice to reveal his watching/collecting is earned through established patterns. Minor deduction for some emotional summarization ("shared and silent sorrow") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation and internal consistency are strong, with his faith in "older metrics" driving concrete actions like the marble ritual. The final choice to crack the pristine marble shows earned character arc through visible cost. Minor deduction for the manager's underdeveloped antagonism and some diagnostic self-awareness ("wisely pragmatic way") that slightly dulls authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization through embodied details (hydraulic-stained hands, practical vs theoretical tension) and a meaningful internal shift from skepticism to vertigo. The final realization lands with genuine emotional weight ("irrevocably, and quietly, re-calibrated forever"), though Aris remains somewhat functional rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—his "strange creative fever" drives concrete actions from studying stains to lowering the program into water. The decisive choice to "disrupt the placid surface" shows internal contradiction resolved through action with visible cost (destroying the artifact). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("wordless conversation") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—needing certainty yet preserving ambiguity—act simultaneously in the scene through her physical approach and retreat from the smudged word. The final renunciation (choosing not to decipher) carries visible emotional cost: "a clean, high-altitude ache." Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "fault-tolerant oracle" metaphor that occasionally distances from embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("three-word sickness I'd swallowed") and clear motivation driving reckless exploration. The protagonist's contradictory impulses - skepticism versus engagement with the paranormal - create authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the confession itself, which remains unspecified.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's need for silence against the accumulated weight of stories creates genuine internal tension, with embodied details like "thin and dusted with papyrus decay." The final choice to temporarily suspend duty shows clear motivation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("gravity had begun to unmoor me") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's internal conflict between holding onto grief and allowing wonder is embodied through her white-knuckled grip on the lacquered box, then the tender, protective closure of her hand at the end. Elias's motivation to "nurture lifelong wonder" drives his patient, adaptive approach throughout. The transformation from desperate grip to tender protection shows earned change with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation as an "odd historian" collecting sonic memories is distinctive and consistently drives his actions through the diary discovery. His sensitively perceptive nature manifests concretely in feeling "the ghost of the ink, the pressure of the pen," though the character lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate to the 8+ band. The final moment of accepting his role as "archivist of the ache" shows earned resignation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" drives consistent choices through orchestrating the exchange and ultimately leaving his post, with internal complexity shown through his "curse" of accidental prophecy. The final renunciation of his role carries visible cost through abandoning his established life and tools. Minor deduction for some abstraction in describing his "unusual occupation" without more embodied emotional stakes during the operation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied characterization through Alistair's methodical precision and Elara's rigid physicality under possession. The entity's monochrome philosophy creates genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the entity's somewhat abstract nature limiting full emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's "chronological homesickness" drives authentic internal conflict, with concrete embodiment through the nautilus shell and physical exhaustion. The final shift from "painful lament to a single, sustained, foundational note" shows earned transformation through accumulated understanding. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("conductor of unheard symphonies") that occasionally distances from immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's internal struggle between fighting and accepting his memory creates genuine contradictory impulses that act in scene, particularly in the transition from treating the tablet as map to understanding it as codex. The final choice to accept rather than fight the painful memory is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in losing his gravity-defying ability.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her pursuit of "filament of hush," with internal contradiction between numbness and desperate search for feeling. The audience members' varied physical responses (weeping, self-embrace) show authentic emotional complexity without tidy resolution. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("gray fog of emotional numbness") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's characterization as a methodical meteorologist who reads atmospheric data like others read people is compelling and specific. His response to the pigeon message—seeing it as "a path to be followed" rather than a code to break—demonstrates consistent character logic. The progression from passive observer to active participant feels earned through his specialized knowledge, though the emotional stakes of his "fragile integrity" could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's grief-driven caution and sensory hypersensitivity create clear, embodied motivation throughout. His contradictory impulses—seeking yet fearing the scent's trigger—play out in scene through trembling hands and measured breaths. The final acceptance of grief as "cleansing sorrow" rather than "sharp terror" shows earned transformation with visible cost in his tears.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of time itself" drives concrete choices through observation, dialogue with the Lumin, and his final stance. His internal contradiction between joining the collective and maintaining individual consciousness plays out through embodied details like tracing the bowl's rim and touching the rope. The closure choice is earned through his poet's sensibility rather than sudden epiphany, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("library of burned books").

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied perception—hearing "the groan of settling silt and the whisper of her own blood"—and her final choice to play the wreckage itself emerges from accumulated sensory detail. The grandfather's wisdom about music that can "unbind what is trapped" earns its payoff through specific action rather than remaining abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's internal contradictions between professional detachment and empathetic absorption play out through embodied sensation ("cold, dense stone" settling in his chest). The final choice to absorb sorrow as "the price of his craft" shows earned renunciation with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward explanatory rather than purely experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes beautifully through the "profound click of understanding" when Alina reveals David's story, earning the final gesture through accumulated particulars. The internal contradiction between his shrewd business persona and "whimsically attentive nature" creates authentic complexity. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("cautious exuberance") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to belong drives concrete actions from standing to join the search to his final offering of reed mats. His internal contradiction between creating "transient things in a world of permanence" manifests through embodied details like his "hammering heart" and the "luminescent ache." The transformation from isolation to belonging is earned through accumulated gestures, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("This was the core of his luminescent ache").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (sketching the city's pulse, following the Chronovore), with his life's ambition to "find the place where echoes are born" driving choices under pressure. The internal shift from seeking a physical place to understanding echo's birthplace as "the brief, terrifying silence of an interrupted cadence" earns the closure with visible cost. Minor deduction for some explanatory interiority ("He knew the giant's nap was the only thing protecting") rather than fully embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation to "quantify the void" through magical mathematics is compelling and specific. His internal state manifests through concrete actions—the careful placement of glass eyes, channeling emotion through stone—though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("profound and stable understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation "to become visible to those who need you" drives concrete choices with embodied urgency—his "quiet click of satisfaction" and the physical archaeology through dusty crawl spaces. The contradiction between wanting visibility while remaining unseen creates genuine tension that earns the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong internal contradiction between preservation impulse and recognition of necessary change, with the final choice to clear wreckage earned through accumulated observation. The "circuitously sincere" trait manifests beautifully through plant-directed speech revealing self-truths.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's exhausted artist motivation is embodied through concrete details ("dabbing at canvases," "fool's errand") and his transformation from seeking landscape to human story feels earned. The woman's characterization is thinner but sufficient for her crucible role. Internal contradiction plays out in his simultaneous desperation and skepticism about finding meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra's transformation from "fearful jailer" to accepting guide is earned through the visceral return of her clairvoyance in overlapping shadows, with clear cost in her lost gift. The internal contradiction between protective duty and the cave's true desire acts simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for Kael's relatively thin characterization beyond his pure motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation as archivist-healer is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through his reactive visions when touching objects. The old woman's transformation from despair to resolve provides earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("hearten the survivors") but the final choice to continue searching shows clear value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and builds through concrete discoveries. The "trembling certainty" effectively embodies his emotional state through physical detail. However, the final transformation from seeker to keeper feels slightly rushed - the acceptance lacks sufficient internal resistance or cost consideration to fully earn the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's skepticism-to-acceptance arc is earned through concrete struggle with his grandmother's materials and the physical trial of the storm. His "courageously kind hands—kind to her memory" moment shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final acceptance isn't a tidy conversion but a "simple, profound acceptance of connection" that preserves his core character while transforming his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Xylos's motivation is crystalline—eons of boredom driving him toward "the only adventure left." His internal state builds coherently through embodied details like the "calcified" boredom becoming "purpose." The final choice to step through the rift earns its weight through accumulated weariness, though some interiority borders on explanatory ("architect of his ennui").

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is crystalline - seeking mathematical equilibrium for her father's destructions drives every choice. The internal contradiction between inherited dishonesty (using father's forgery chemical) and personal honesty creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for slightly overwrought "deathly vitality" phrasing in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is beautifully specific—collecting textures of non-existent times through synesthetic translation. Her earnest studiosity manifests through precise ritual and the contradictory impulse of preserving what never was. The final moment of "incandescent restraint" and "deep, internal warmth" embodies her satisfaction with visible cost: she works alone against an immense silence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to build identity from collected fragments is compelling and consistent, with embodied emotion in the layering scene. The internal contradiction between erasure and existence drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "patchwork soul" construction, though the poison label grounds it with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his myth-buster identity transformed into truth-seeking obsession. The internal tension between his scientific skepticism and belief in Thorne's work creates authentic contradiction. His final "gloomy cheerfulness" embodies complex emotion at discovering a lifelong task. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary in "wave of gloomy cheerfulness washed over him."

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's dual nature (orderly intuitive navigating chaos) creates genuine internal contradiction that drives his solution. The "torment of dual allegiance" manifests concretely in his method choice. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("simple and agonizing") rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's purposeful curiosity drives him to transgress company protocols, creating genuine internal tension between duty and grandfather's legacy. The final beat shows him carrying "a beautiful ache that would linger," earning the emotional cost through his witnessing of extinction rather than declaring it.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her tactile expertise and "magnetic calm." Her blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her unique method. The internal consistency holds, though the emotional stakes could deepen beyond professional competence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his mentor's legacy, with concrete embodiment through his actions (watching Lyra, studying the phrasebook). The transformation from skeptical cartographer to "sole archivist" lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("familiar stir of resolve") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "infinitely patient" attribute manifests through methodical action, though internal contradiction could be stronger. The character's specialized knowledge and ritualistic approach create specificity. The final choice to return daily shows earned commitment with implied cost of time and effort.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist's motivation is crystal clear and drives every choice, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the capture sequence ("Instinct shrieked at me to abort" while determination pushes forward). The final acceptance of death while clutching the vial shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("psychic residue") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in his legacy of disbelief, driving him to seek truth in isolation. His internal conflict between inherited skepticism and desire for validation creates genuine tension. The final choice to break the seal shows agency with visible cost—he knows he'll be disbelieved. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("copperlight repose") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's progression from unease to understanding is well-embodied through concrete actions (finding the bead, experiencing bone-deep chimes). The ghost bride Lyra manifests clear motivation through her "lovingly venomous" influence. Minor deduction for the final paragraph's slight drift toward explanation over embodiment, though the cost remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, with his "hauntingly optimistic spirit" driving concrete actions from discovering the plate through the storm crisis. His internal state remains somewhat abstract ("quiet, fervent prayer") rather than viscerally embodied, and the secondary sleepwalkers lack distinct presence despite their thematic importance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing roots with her boot and the "painstaking work of freeing" the sundial. The shift from "profound hollowness" to "peaceful acceptance" is earned through physical discovery, though the final insight about "perpetual departure" edges toward articulated epiphany rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation as a "ghost who gives other ghosts a name" is clear and distinctive, with concrete embodiment through his methodical actions. The internal drive to "discover meaning in the margins" manifests through specific choices like using analog methods in a digital age. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the quiet hum beneath his skin") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through embodied craft-as-method thinking ("her mind would trace a path through adjacent possibilities") and the ironic blind spot of being seen as harmless while conducting espionage. The final choice to transmit carries visible risk ("heart-stopping moment, the system lagged"), though internal contradiction could be sharper during the decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied characterization through "skin around her eyes bruised with shadow" and Elara's physical depletion after evocation. Kael's transformation from "quiet desperation" to "shattering understanding" is earned through the witnessed memory, with visible emotional cost in his silent weeping. The "fierce tenderness" of Elara's craft shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between professional distance and empathetic connection drives authentic choices, particularly his decision to translate emotional rather than strategic information. The General's transformation from commander to father is earned through specific embodied moments—the "subtle, sharp motion in his throat"—rather than declaration. Minor deduction for the coral fragment serving more as backstory anchor than active constraint on present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—the physical handling of the fresco fragment and the delicate light-painting process effectively dramatizes his internal state. The contradiction between desperately seeking joy and knowing he must be gentle with the memory creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "quiet ache in his chest" when more specific embodiment would strengthen the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's methodical playfulness manifests through concrete actions—systematically surveying the garden, deliberately orchestrating echoes, choosing uncertainty over cerulean. His internal shift from "dull desire to return" to "wanted more questions" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with the final choice carrying visible cost in abandoning predictable mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing the wilting sunflower and his decision to deploy the seed. The "cold dread, sharp and sudden" shows embodied emotion under pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("carved into the bedrock of his soul") that could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's transformation from metabolizing sorrow into accepting pain as creative fuel shows clear internal progression with embodied emotion ("hands that did not tremble"). The shift from isolation to connection through her changed music demonstrates earned change with visible cost. However, the epiphany about pain needing to "bloom" rather than be conquered feels slightly unearned through prior dramatization, and some emotional articulation tends toward abstraction ("reef-shadow joy").

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - the "practiced slowness," the ritual that holds "crushing emptiness at bay." The contradiction between preservation and loss operates throughout, with the "foxglove regret" of saving memory but not life earning its emotional complexity. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "extinct feelings" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is crystal clear with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (cautious exuberance vs. desperate fear), and his final choice to risk everything through the modified Proto-Aenic form carries visible cost. The "carefully reckless" trait manifests through concrete actions rather than labels. Slight deduction for Elara's limited interiority in her pivotal moment, though her guarded pain and tentative reach work adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in his inheritance of both duty and mystery. His internal conflict between perceived abandonment and discovered sacrifice lands with genuine emotional weight. The transformation from believing his father's "rigid dedication had driven her away" to understanding protective love is earned through concrete discovery, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—preserving Lena's music while reinventing his past—act simultaneously throughout, with embodied grief in his balancing ritual and bird training. The final choice to share Lena's echo with Anna is earned through prior accumulation of trust-building moments. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("panic seized him") during the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation evolves from simple return to understanding sacred thresholds, with internal conflict between fear and determination embodied through physical actions like tracing wood grain. The final choice to step through the threshold despite its finality shows earned agency with visible cost—permanent separation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("featherly determined") that briefly disrupts embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation to find belonging through understanding the station's rhythm is concrete and drives his actions consistently. The burnt feather provides tangible connection to lost home, and his final realization that belonging comes through shared wonder rather than replacement shows earned character growth. Elara's transformation from skepticism to awe works, though her interiority remains somewhat thin.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's professional curiosity and methodical approach create a consistent character with clear motivation. The final realization that "some paths don't disappear, they just become so concentrated that they turn into something new entirely" represents genuine character insight earned through the investigation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional work - the traveler's emotions are transliterated rather than embodied in Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is crystal clear—transforming monotony through calculated creativity—and his methodical patience under no external pressure shows strong character consistency. The internal satisfaction as his only required applause reveals authentic character depth. Minor deduction for the couple's reaction being somewhat convenient, though their shared wonder works thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in creation rather than defiance, with contradictory impulses (exile/connection) acting simultaneously. The transformation from dancer to embodied verse is earned through prior struggle, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("translator whose tongue could not quite form the final, crucial word").

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent - his need to find meaning through light and glass drives every choice. The internal contradiction between his desire for permanence (the atrium) and his acceptance of transience creates genuine tension. His final renunciation of saving the atrium carries visible emotional cost, though some interiority edges toward the abstract ("fundamental grammar of the world").

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's internal contradiction between protecting innocence and accepting its necessary loss drives authentic choices. The moment of choosing to shield both girl and box reveals layered values through embodied action. Minor deduction for Kaelen's relative passivity as listener rather than active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's characterization as a "logical dreamer" who treats hope as an equation is distinctive and consistent throughout, with her methodical approach to quantum nudges showing clear motivation. The internal experience of watching the gauge needle drop then rise creates genuine tension. However, the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she proceeds with unwavering confidence rather than wrestling with doubt during the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—discovering what walls dream about drives her methodical investigation. Her internal conflict between professional detachment and emotional engagement manifests through embodied action (gentle touch on brittle leather, careful placement of the negative back). The final choice to leave the evidence "where it belonged" represents earned renunciation with visible cost, though some interiority relies on abstraction ("weight of confession").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mirage painter's motivation is clear and consistent - using ephemeral art to show possibilities. His "borrowed heartbeat" mechanism and the specific embodied details (rhythm against ribs, conducting light) ground the character. The piece earns its quiet transformation through accumulated detail, though internal conflict could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied psychology through white knuckles, rigid jaw, and trembling hands at closure. The transformation from defiance to surrender is earned through Elias's specific ritual actions. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("masks of granite," "mutual hatred") rather than fully embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between water baron and penitent dreamer drives the entire arc, with his "fractured grace" gesture earning its cost through established causality. The "sentimental flaw buried beneath ruthless pragmatism" creates genuine tension, though some interior phrasing edges toward abstract ("fractured his iron resolve").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—harvesting emotional echoes to seed change through returned truths. Her internal state remains controlled throughout, though we lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to release the echoes is earned through her decade-long preparation, with visible cost in the "immense burden she had carried."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's internal conflict between artistic philosophy and ethical responsibility drives authentic change. His shift from "uncommonly serene" certitude to "the first tremor of doubt" through to purposeful action is causally earned. The hollow-eyed man serves as effective pressure without being on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—honoring overlooked histories through ephemeral monuments. His internal contradiction between realism ("knew that great engine had already ground to a halt") and ritualistic action creates authentic complexity. The final choice to build despite futility shows earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is crystal clear - preserving forgotten names drives every action with embodied precision ("surgeon's precision born from the memory of clumsy, grieving hands"). The "snowmelt ardor" physically manifests his internal state against the arctic setting. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "calm had settled in his bones" opening that tells before showing.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's fractured temporal perception creates genuine internal contradiction—he exists only in memory and premonition, never the present, which drives his desperate consumption of the wafer seal. The final transformation where he gains present-tense awareness lands with earned cost: he traded his unique temporal sight for mortal immediacy as the bunker floods.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kavi's motivation is clear and consistent—his "encrypted devotion" to uncovering cosmic truth through mathematical precision. His internal state effectively combines scientific rigor with spiritual yearning, particularly in "This was the moment where logic was meant to blossom into miracle." The character earns his revelation through methodical preparation, though the lack of meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses during the ritual prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation as a "schemer who builds cures instead of weapons" drives consistent tactical choices through cellular memory transmission. The characterization achieves specificity through her method of bypassing intellect to reach Vale's scarred architecture, though Vale remains more conceptual force than embodied character. The final choice—Vale's decision to release resentment—lands with earned causality from the accumulated sensory memories.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is beautifully grounded in her father's failed dream, with embodied emotional specificity in the frozen tear and the synchronized breathing method.

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "fragile, desperate thing" description of motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong internal contradiction between Elian's rigid traditionalism and eventual acceptance of change, with embodied frustration and concrete micro-choices.

Minor deduction for the slightly convenient epiphany moment, though it's grounded in concrete objects.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge creates clear internal conflict against his mandate "to never, ever try to understand," driving him to the bathroom breakthrough. His embodied stress ("pressure of the paradoxes...building behind his eyes") and concrete micro-choices (pocketing the cameo, retreating, examining it) reveal character under pressure. The final transformation from bewilderment to "terrible clarity" is earned through the dramatized realization, though the epiphany itself edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from scholar to urgent rescuer is well-motivated through Kael's arrival, with concrete embodied details like "stitched together from temporal paradoxes and raw fear."

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to find her absorbed twin brother drives every choice with escalating cost, particularly the final realization that she must become his memorial rather than recover him. The internal contradiction between seeking to recapture him while losing herself is embodied through concrete actions with the swatch cards. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the chimera twin concept initially, though it crystallizes powerfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's methodical curiosity drives consistent, believable choices through escalating impossibility. His motivation "to translate confusion into clarity" manifests in concrete actions - researching the pattern, retrieving artifacts, weaving the rope.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is crystalline and his internal state richly embodied through "hammered repose" and the physical weight of sound. The character makes meaningful micro-choices (selecting specific ice, internalizing its pattern) that reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is deeply rooted in his retrocognitive curse/blessing, with internal contradiction between despair at the silence and hope in cosmic patterns driving him toward the risky reassembly.

His "thistle-blown hope" metaphor embodies character-specific perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's "preemptive nostalgia" creates genuine internal contradiction that drives his choices throughout, particularly in his final decision to preserve the ancestors' choice rather than expose the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's internal journey from despair to renewed purpose is earned through concrete discovery, with his chanting mantra revealing character-specific coping mechanisms. The shift from chemical formulas to colors tracks his evolving perception, though the epiphany about pattern-perception could use more embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's character work is exceptionally grounded in specific, embodied detail—the thumb stroking jade, the sideways mental drift, the warm observant gaze finding the snail. Her internal contradiction between heartbreak and scientific observation creates authentic complexity. Minor deduction for Kael remaining somewhat functional as catalyst rather than fully realized presence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's claustrophobia drives credible, embodied choices with "lungs seized in any room smaller than the sky" and the porcelain doll as tangible anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian's motivation to teach through silence is consistent and drives his patient guidance of the anxious passenger.

Internal conflict could be deeper—Elian operates without visible struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - using historical knowledge rather than force. The peeling sequence shows her methodical expertise, and her final choice to place the ruby carries visible stakes (system purge). Minor deduction for limited interiority during the critical discovery moment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior contradiction between Elara's isolation and her need to reconnect, embodied through physical actions (kneeling in ash, pressing ring to scar). The final choice to breach Liam's defenses is earned through established shared history, though some emotional transitions could be more granular. Micro-choices under pressure (using the ring as conduit, sending feeling not words) reveal clear value hierarchy with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is grounded in her OmniVex trauma, creating a clear through-line from past pressure to present action. Her internal contradiction between fleeing and engaging the Promise reads authentically.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystal clear—uncovering why her dynasty deliberately self-destructed—and her methodical ritual with the gramophone crank reveals character through embodied action. The revelation lands with genuine emotional weight as she discovers her great-grandmother's protective love traded power for safety, making Elara not a failure but "the destination." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "distilled emotion" passage that briefly moves away from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation to "capture the shape of possibility itself" drives concrete action through the dance sequence, with internal stakes clearly established. The character shows competence balanced with genuine struggle, and his final choice to unsnap the clasp carries visible cost through the "cold fire that scoured him clean." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around motivation that could be more embodied.

The character shows consistent resourcefulness through concrete actions, though some interiority edges toward the declarative ("Her motivation was not to win a war..."). Minor deduction for explicit motivation statement that could have emerged through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is crystal clear and drives every action through concrete, embodied gestures—his chlorophyll-stained hands sorting seeds, building monuments from fallen leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's philosophy that "a clock's truest purpose was revealed only after its hands had stopped" establishes clear motivation that drives every choice. His final acceptance of becoming "part of the question" shows earned transformation with visible cost - abandoning his lifelong need to understand and repair. Minor deduction for slightly abstract interiority in places ("uncertainly certain").

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's internal conflict between grief and alchemical discipline creates genuine tension, with embodied emotion ("Sweat and tears mingled on his face") and a meaningful transformation from "crushing weight" to "luminous regret."

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation as "spiritual midwife" who integrates laughter into healing is clear and drives his specific approach to the spirit. The spirit's arc from anguished musician to peaceful luminescence through recovered joy memory earns its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's proprioceptively enhanced awareness creates a compelling paradox of precision amid displacement. His motivation to find "the mathematics of mercy" emerges organically from trauma.

The moment where he falters and must ground himself in simple truth ("He was not a hero...just a music box repairman") shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "honest humility" that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)

    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("feral nostalgia gnawed at me, a longing so sharp and savage it felt like a physical hunger") and genuine internal contradiction between past and present selves.

    Kaelen's contradictory impulses—volcanic rage cooled to diamond resolve—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in his transformation from destroyer to curator.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through his fluid grace contrasted with others' "grunting," his fingers finding the scrimshaw's grooves, and the decisive "I don't want to lose you" exchange with Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's performed narration as grief-management creates genuine internal contradiction, with the whittling revealing deeper impulses than his theatrical surface. The moral ambiguity around watching Mara's arrest lands with real weight. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract formulation "cultivate lightness in grief" which edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's aesthetic yearning and methodical dissolution of boundaries drives clear, consistent motivation throughout. His internal shift from observer to kindred creator is earned through concrete sensory experience with the colonnade. The "cloud-shadow poet" identity manifests in his approach to paraphrasing rather than translating the quartz's signal.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's colorblindness drives his unique perception and ability to read plant arrangements, making him essential to the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion through somatic markers ("cold dread bloomed in his sternum," "warmth spreading from his solar plexus") and contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. desire to connect).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's obsession to "discover the texture of connection" drives consistent, escalating choices through memory manipulation and weaving. His transformation from "unsettling calm" to "deeper, layered hollowness" shows genuine cost, though the mother-memory shift could use more embodied contradiction in-scene rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent - his "balancedly curious nature" drives specific actions from secret algorithm work to the council presentation. The internal contradiction between duty to current students and need to expand horizons creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract handling of his emotional state in places like "quiet, somber marvel."

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment of Leo's emotional state ("throat working as if to swallow a stone"). The closure choice - Elias translating the grandmother's message - is earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in Elias's characterization ("technician of sorrow") that borders on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict against his duty-driven mission, with embodied panic ("cold sweat," "tightness gripped") and the phase-transition sequence showing cost through "nauseating, colorless vibration." The grandmother connection motivates credibly but "my grandmother included" POV slip and the somewhat abstract resolution of "peaceful second" before ghosts "winked out" lack the visceral specificity needed for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is grounded in her liminal state as a "clerical error" seeking wisdom from digital fragments. The heartbeat counting embodies her existential anxiety effectively, and her final reframing of absence as potential shows earned character evolution through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is deeply rooted in preserving language through texture-to-sound translation, with clear internal consistency. The character's copper-veined sensitivity to texture creates a unique perceptual signature. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the emotional stakes - we understand the intellectual drive but less the personal cost of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Julian's motivation is clear and evolves convincingly from bitter investigator to understanding witness, with the sister Clara serving as both catalyst and mirror. The protagonist's internal conflict between exposing Elara and understanding Clara's transformation creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "cosmic joke" formulation in the final beat, though the embodied details of setting down the phone and arrowhead ground the choice effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly rooted and intensifies through the discovery of the locust shell and her experimental method of heart-rhythm synchronization. The final choice to risk confronting the Wardens shows genuine cost, though internal contradiction could be more viscerally embodied during the climactic moment rather than summarized as "fear and hope."

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is crystalline and embodied through concrete action, with his "quiet ache" manifesting in calculated rebellion. The contradiction between duty (mailman) and defiance (smuggler) creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "where broken promises heal" which leans conceptual, though it pays off through dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as the silent carpenter seeking to "interpret silence as possibility" drives consistent character-specific choices, particularly his patient restoration work and the decision to crown the mare. His decade-long muteness breaking into song creates genuine earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing around "purpose of his hands" that edges toward thesis-speak rather than embodied desire.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "sanely eccentric" nature manifests through concrete ritual actions. The internal consistency holds well, though the final moment could show more embodied cost beyond just "a tremor in his hands."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's obsessive quest is grounded in consistent, embodied detail ("heart hammered against his ribs"), and his final acceptance of the presence shows earned transformation. The motivation remains clear throughout, though the dream's nature stays abstract until closure, slightly limiting emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Locksmith's motivation is clear and consistent (freeing trapped ideas), driving his methodical approach to the mother's grief. The mother's emotional arc from grief to "peaceful awe" is earned through witnessing the release, though her characterization remains somewhat thin. The piece excels at embodied perception during the ritual ("air grew thin, expectant") but lacks internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is crystal clear and compelling—recovering stolen memories from a childhood flood drives every action. His chronic curiosity manifests beautifully through thirty years of meticulous observation finally breaking into direct intervention. The moment he touches the mushroom and receives his mother's memory carries genuine emotional weight with visible cost (the ache "both hollow and full").

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's backward-walking nervous tell and fractured perception create genuine embodied contradiction. Elara's shift from seeking escape to choosing presence lands with earned causality through the knot metaphor and her final action of restacking scrolls, though her earlier passivity slightly dampens the score.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his lineage's purpose, with concrete embodied action in the seed-planting ritual. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - he proceeds with unwavering certainty. The "insatiably creative" attribute manifests in his unconventional method but doesn't create visible character-specific cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's expertise and calm against mounting dread creates effective tension, with concrete details like "patching ceramic faces" grounding the fantastical premise. Kaelen's transition from "fragile dam" to accepting the needle shows earned character movement. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's methodical curiosity and "shielded openness" drive concrete choices throughout—from archival research to frame-by-frame comparison—with her final annotation crystallizing a shift from repair to acknowledgment. The internal tension between preserving and revealing knowledge earns the closure, though some interiority relies on abstractions ("empathetic rush") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—the physical exploration mirrors the internal quest to understand grief's physics. The father-daughter parallel enriches without overshadowing the protagonist's arc. Minor deduction for Mortimer remaining somewhat abstract as a "silent partner" without fuller integration into the narrator's decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is crystal clear - articulating Lyra's unspoken loneliness through their shared graffiti language. His internal state ("driftingly alert calm") manifests in deliberate, dance-like movements. The emotional progression from focused work to "weary smile" feels earned, though the piece could push deeper into contradictory impulses during the moment of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's warmly inquisitive nature drives the central action of seeking truth through the diary, with clear internal motivation rooted in loyalty and duty. The discovery transforms from public anguish to private maternal hope, creating earned emotional complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "affectionate detachment" at closure rather than more embodied response.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to memorialize Lena through cloud categorization is clear and embodied through specific actions with the telescope. The contradiction between his scientific training and mystical belief creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "fear was a low-altitude emotion" which verges on diagnostic label-speak, though the character's transformation from meteorologist to "curator" lands with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's face-blindness that paradoxically enables her to read patterns others miss is beautifully embodied through concrete action (fingers reading the coin's fractally precise marks). The contradiction between limitation and strength drives the closure choice effectively. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "pattern of anxieties" early on.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as a solitary map apprentice hunting the stranded luminance is clear and consistent. His "diligently curious" nature manifests through concrete actions—studying wear patterns, cross-referencing the phrasebook, sketching starling movements. The transformation from "apprentice" to "cartographer of living light" feels earned through accumulated discoveries, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is embodied through "familiar ache" and "quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs," with her lunar-eclipse heritage meaningfully constraining her solution. The mirror reflections showing "countless Elaras... some triumphant, most failing" create genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "rhythm of repair" which could be more concretely embodied in the early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong ensemble characterization with clear individual voices (Anya as discoverer, Kaelen as skeptic, Elara as faithful leader) and meaningful collective arc from strangers to unified family. The ghost's altruistic motivation is consistent and drives the plot without requiring direct appearance. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("Hope was a story they told each other") rather than fully embodied states, but the final choice to trust and work together is earned through accumulated actions with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to grant peace through the lullaby is clear and rooted in memory of his mother, with embodied emotion through the puppet head and physical exhaustion. The internal conflict between "breathtaking, impossible arrogance" and "bruised awe" creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of his work lacking more concrete stakes in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's weary resignation and "stubborn spark" create authentic internal contradiction, with his inherited burden driving concrete choices under time pressure. The character's competence balanced against genuine struggle (wrestling with unseen force) and his cynical-yet-caring stance earn the stakes. Minor deduction for slight emotional flattening in the final beat where his weariness could show more specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's internal conflict between rigid scientific thinking and artistic understanding drives authentic change through embodied grief ("tight, hard knot in his chest") and concrete perception shifts. The final choice to celebrate rather than apologize shows earned transformation with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the polymer/chain metaphor explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent—his "quiet, obsessive need to find the place where stories begin" drives every action. The internal contradiction between selling beginnings while not understanding origins creates genuine tension. The final choice to create the first wound/flaw is earned through his patient cartography of absence, though the emotional cost could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" drives genuine internal conflict through embodied sensation (the fossilized bivalve's weight, tasting legions of sorrow). The final transformation from brittle to "sturdy" lands with earned cost after subsumption, though the Warlord remains somewhat functional rather than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's empathetically decisive nature manifests beautifully through his ability to feel the system's pain while maintaining operational clarity. The contradiction between vigorous action and tender approach creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "psychic repositories" which could use more embodied grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's helix-minded thinking and motivation to become "archeologist of abandoned dreams" create consistent, specific characterization that drives the neural modification choice. The internal conflict between self-dissolution risk and preservation imperative generates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the composer appearing only as retrieved memory rather than complicating Elara's decision-making process.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's prism-mind ability creates genuine specificity and his internal drive is well-embodied through concrete actions. The contradiction between preserving dangerous knowledge and protecting humanity adds depth. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract notion of "intellectual plague" that lacks immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's deafness driving her to "create music in a silent world" establishes clear, embodied motivation that intensifies through discovering the Old One's stress-crack "score." The final choice to release stored histories through empathetic pressure shows contradictory impulses (imposing vs. releasing) acting in scene with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("symphonically minded brain") that edges toward label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelan's motivation is clear and consistent—finding beauty/logic in the difficult—embodied through tactile details like the worry stone's dent and teeth aching from magnetic energy. His chess master's analytical mindset credibly drives his method of translating silence into strategic patterns. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final emotional resolution ("hopeful melancholy") that could use more embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—his desire to preserve silence while the world celebrates noise—drive a credible internal conflict that culminates in the earned moment of the clasp opening. His peculiar motivation to "catalog the varieties of silence" is consistently embodied through concrete actions and sensory perception ("tasting colors and hearing textures"). The final choice to leave the diary unread demonstrates genuine character integrity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's hypersensitive olfactory gift creates genuine internal contradiction—her greatest tool threatens to overwhelm her during the wind shift. The final choice to find stillness within sensory chaos rather than blocking it out represents earned character growth with visible cost (the pain behind her eyes, the threat to her carefully constructed peace).

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—refusing to watch trees die, using the Inversion as opportunity. The internal experience during navigation shows good sensory specificity ("vibration that resonated in Elara's teeth and bones"). Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where finding the shard immediately suggests it will cure the blight without dramatized struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation as an accident investigator seeking to "cultivate foresight in action" drives consistent choices throughout, with his methodology revealing character through specific professional habits. The internal conflict between his quest for predictive mastery and the hollow victory of understanding arrives too late, though the emotional complexity in the final beat could be more embodied rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory details, with his synesthetic perception creating a distinct character lens. The internal stakes feel genuine though the transformation itself lacks visible personal cost - he succeeds without struggle or sacrifice that would elevate the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (arranging driftwood, playing the flute differently). The insight about treating the flute "like a hammer when it was meant to be a needle and thread" shows genuine character understanding earned through scene. However, the emotional progression relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand emotion's "fundamental mathematics" drives consistent choices through borrowing, transposing, and abstracting. Anya's grief embodiment is specific ("clutched a small, worn photograph"). The transformation from feeling to shape lands with visible disorientation as cost, though Elias's emotional opacity after the initial mirroring slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's transformation from "jittery courier" to "a man who finally understood" is earned through concrete embodied details—trembling fingers becoming "perfectly still." The contradiction between his anxiety and wonder operates simultaneously in scene, particularly when he watches Elara's memory while processing the crystalline garden's impossibility.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization with clear motivation rooted in grief and scientific obsession. The contradictory impulses between mystic belief and scientific method create genuine tension. The final realization lands with earned devastation, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("desolate clarity").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's internal journey from purposeful sacrifice to complete amnesia creates a powerful character arc with visible cost. The contradiction between her consuming motivation and the price she pays (losing memories of love) drives genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of some emotional states ("wistful ache") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details ("hands too gentle for his trade") and his decisive barter of sensory memories shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cost is visceral - he feels "hollowed out, the flavors of his past now just empty words." Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around "quietly determined spirit" but the final choice lands with genuine sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is crystal clear and deeply rooted in his fifteen-year quest for truth about Elara. His transformation from seeker to protector lands with genuine emotional weight. The internal conflict between needing truth and bearing its cost reads authentically, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("the weight of a withheld truth").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation to protect crystallizes powerfully when the light fails, transforming from routine into desperate need. The internal contradiction between his reticent nature and his compulsion to save the keeper lands with genuine emotional weight. Minor deduction for the keeper remaining abstract despite the intimacy established through their stone/note exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelan's manic laughter and obsessive ritual demonstrate clear motivation rooted in his role as Storm Herald, with his internal state embodied through physical trembling and exhaustion. The final realization that "the dawn was beginning to shape him too" provides earned character development with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cathedral of light and shadow") and limited internal contradiction shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's transformation from dye master to observer of human luminescence is grounded in the visceral reality of the donor heart, with embodied details like "a tired and stuttering drum" and "quietly explosive." The protagonist's motivation evolves naturally through concrete actions (tracking sun trails, studying the morpho wing), though the final revelation about the heart donor feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned through prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions—his "quantified sorrow" work and deeper need to understand what trees witness. The final choice to archive rather than fix sadness shows earned wisdom. Minor deduction for slight emotional abstraction in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's fractured memory state creates genuine internal tension, with her motivation to heal the realm clearly rooted in duty and the embodied need to gather song fragments. The progression from scattered recollection to wholeness earns the final transformation, though some interiority edges toward the abstract ("heavy cloak" metaphor).

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's paradoxical nature as a "compassionate recluse" drives authentic internal conflict throughout, with embodied emotional states ("heart a frantic bird against his ribs") and a meaningful transformation earned through his technique of "staying while leaving." The final choice to leave the invitation as acknowledgment demonstrates genuine character evolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through specific actions (guerrilla gardening as "tender defiance"), with contradictory impulses shown in scene—holding the fossilized bread as both "private sin" and sacred relic. The patrolman's shift from authority to recognition ("My mother waited in line for that bread") shows earned character movement through shared memory rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is crystalline—to preserve meaning from oblivion through technical precision—and his internal struggle between futility and purpose creates genuine tension. The moment when he whispers "Hold" to the failing light reveals authentic desperation beneath his methodical exterior. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract treatment of his emotional state in places like "found his purpose" rather than more embodied reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the brass device and her need to "capture the sound of trust breaking." Her steadfastness manifests credibly in the final confrontation, and the contradictory impulses between preserving family loyalty and documenting betrayal create genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "the metallic tang of unspoken agreements."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's skepticism drives genuine investigation with embodied sensory perception (taste changes) and conflicted impulses between scientific certainty and witnessed phenomena. The carriers' distinct weather signatures create vivid characterization through physical manifestation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract resolution of internal conflict, though the final recognition of "learning to read a map written in lightning and rain" shows earned humility with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("charcoal dust under his fingernails a gritty reminder") and clear motivation arc from artistic bankruptcy to renewal. The contradiction between his gift and its hollow use creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of his insight after years of staring at the painting.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation through his yearning for authenticity drives clear choices, from assembling the map to planting the seed. The Silver-Vein fern as embodied truth-detector adds specificity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "quiet obsession" about lost conversations that could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation to preserve wonder is embodied through physical craft and seasonal muteness that enforces focus. His internal state reads through action—"muted vigor," "quiet burning"—rather than exposition. The final moment of "calm satisfaction" and searching for the next truth shows earned continuity rather than resolution, though some phrasing edges toward the abstract ("guardian," "collective consciousness").

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The android's motivation to resolve its "inner static" by containing Elara's childhood fears drives clear, escalating choices with embodied contradiction between mechanical nature and emotional glitch. The final choice to step into the desert carries visible cost—leaving the "perfect, static garden" behind. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("mosaic of a life I never lived") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation through patient listening is consistent and embodied through concrete micro-choices (bringing his mug, sitting on the wall, waiting). The final choice to use the locket as key is earned through accumulated neighborhood memories, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the discovery moment.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystalline—liberating her mother's fractured consciousness by embracing the vulnerability her mother couldn't. The dance-as-code-breaking embodiment is specific and earned. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "fractured consciousness" without more embodied detail of what liberation means physically.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is crystal clear and emotionally grounded in the loss of Elara's memories. His contradictory impulses—hope against impossible odds, tenderness toward a stranger who was once his wife—play out through concrete actions like carrying the wildflower book and performing his divination ritual. The moment of contact with the memory cluster embodies his desperate reach across an impossible threshold with palpable yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - to silence the prophecy through magical means. The "tranquil blaze" paradox effectively captures her controlled intensity. Internal state is well-embodied through concrete actions, though the character lacks meaningful internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara's obsession with building language drives consistent motivation throughout, with her need for truth naturally evolving from curiosity. The "agreed upon lies" creates genuine internal tension. Elias functions effectively as both character and embodied concept, though his transition from man to building-consciousness could use more embodied emotion at the revelation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's journey from "charmed skeptic" to memory-seeker is well-motivated with clear internal contradiction between skepticism and longing. The final choice to embrace painful truth over curated peace shows genuine character agency with visible emotional cost ("single tear tracked through the dust"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ghostly resolve," "tragically radiant") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is concrete and emotionally complex - "a quiet, desperate need to forgive the unfinished" - driving a precise action with clear internal stakes. The character demonstrates expertise through specific knowledge of grammatical glyphs and calligraphy pressure. Minor deduction for limited embodied emotion during the pivotal moment and some abstraction in "profound peace."

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss (her mother's silence), driving her quest through embodied perception ("felt less in her ears and more in the marrow of her bones"). The transformation from question-asker to "finisher of songs" shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("reed-blown melancholy") and limited internal contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" drives concrete actions through dream-diving and truth-weaving, with the boy's release providing earned closure. The man's phantom shows believable self-deception ("It was an accident" repeated until almost true), though his villainy could use more nuance. Internal conflict operates through Elara's "delicate art" requiring careful truth-weaving rather than accusation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's philosophical bent emerges through embodied details (calloused fingers, tea ritual) and his specific way of seeing fireflies as "living knots." His final whistling attempt and acceptance show authentic character-driven choice with visible emotional cost in the moment of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's methodical expertise and scientific skepticism drive consistent choices through the investigation, with the final act of lowering the diamond showing measured restraint over exploitation. The character's professional detachment creates subtle tension against the locals' beliefs, though internal contradiction could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving escalating choices under pressure. The final broadcast represents earned agency with visible cost (rejecting spectral masters for human autonomy). Internal conflict between serving shadows versus shepherding humanity creates genuine tension. Slight deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("cold and sharp panic") rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vagrant poet's motivation to "become the translator between generations" drives consistent action through jar-collecting and the music box transformation, with embodied longing ("wistful ache") and specific gestural work. The final act of placing the seashell shows earned renunciation of restoration in favor of translation, though the internal contradiction between loss and creation could be more viscerally fought in-scene rather than philosophically resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete physical responses to the threat. The "logically emotional" attribute manifests well as she acknowledges fear but acts on calculated survival. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "deeply ingrained command" which lacks specific personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's internal conflict between impatience and cultivated patience drives the story with embodied contradiction ("wild animal clawing at her ribs"). The final choice to act is earned through months of patient observation, with visible cost in the "frantic drum" of her heart finally stilling into "serene and terrible" victory.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's characterization is grounded in concrete specifics—his "watchfully calm precision" manifests in methodical observation, and his internal conflict between professional detachment and sudden vulnerability creates genuine tension. The entangled memories force him to confront something beyond empirical evidence, earning his final choice to include the psychological context. However, the emotional progression feels slightly compressed; the jump from skepticism to acceptance of the phantom memories lacks intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong character work with Arthur's transition from offering "scripture, prayer, absolution" to understanding his role as guide. The internal contradiction between faith and fact plays out through concrete choices, though Elias's transformation from prisoner to craftsman feels slightly underexplored for full credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's steadily curious nature drives concrete choices under pressure, particularly the leap of faith to test his discovery. His internal contradictions play out in scene ("no sense building a church if you're afraid to pray") and the final choice carries visible cost—risking death over the acid sea. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("stubbornly steady curious nature") but embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's obsessive search for her brother drives every choice with clear emotional stakes, and her lie to Kael shows contradictory impulses (protecting truth vs. maintaining cover) acting in scene. The "brightly attentive" trait enables her pattern recognition but lacks visible cost trade-offs. Final choice to forward Julian's data earns closure through prior causality with career/safety cost implied.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion in Mara's "shoulders slumped, the rigid anger draining away" and Kael's intuitive methodology. Internal contradiction operates well through Mara's fear masquerading as anger. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak in "map empathy onto action" though it's quickly grounded in scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)

    Elias's internal contradiction between holding onto pain and seeking peace manifests beautifully through his physical interaction with the burned letter fragment.

Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated insight about "intersubjective understanding" which edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—his economical movements and peripheral awareness technique show rather than tell his character. The "strangely honest" trait manifests in his direct confrontation of distortion and his willingness to act alone.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "perceptively calm demeanor" manifests through concrete actions of patient arrangement and seasonal returns.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's contradictory impulses—desperate certainty to capture versus peaceful acceptance—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in the chalk circle moment where his hand moves "by a simpler, more honest impulse."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" driven by loss of his partner creates clear, consistent pressure through to the sacrifice of his treasured lens.

    Elias's internal contradiction between rational skepticism and desperate yearning for faith drives genuine complexity, particularly in his recognition that "forgiving himself for dismissing the woman he loved would be the work of a lifetime."

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cartography of his own failures") that briefly distances from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (polishing with "careful, repetitive motions"). The fire memory provides concrete backstory that justifies her goal "to share light without using fire." Internal conflict between earthbound reality and celestial yearning creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional processing ("quiet, determined goal" could be more embodied).

    Strong embodied interiority with Kaelen's "hollowed-out look" and Elara's careful, non-invasive care creating genuine character pressure. The amber pendant choice crystallizes competing impulses (fossil vs. flow) with visible cost.

    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—translating heartbeats into maps through patient stillness—with embodied physicality ("knees cracking in the profound cold") and a meaningful renunciation (personal comfort for others' safety) that carries visible cost. The character demonstrates genuine expertise balanced with struggle, though interiority occasionally edges toward over-articulation ("desperate art" feels slightly diagnostic).

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's peripherally focused trait drives his method and eventual success, with clear motivation rooted in storing wonder. The internal consistency holds throughout, though the emotional arc remains somewhat cerebral rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—collecting burdens to give them "a final, quiet home"—with internal contradiction between his cosmic awareness and physical imprisonment driving genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("fingers closed around," "held it to his ear") and clear motivation arc from denial to acceptance. The ghost functions as externalized internal conflict effectively. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "regret was not a weight anymore, but a release" which could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation evolves credibly from vague philosophical searching to focused problem-solving, with concrete embodied details like "steel-toed boots scuffing" and "quiet hum of curiosity."

    Elias's internal contradiction between creative ambition and monastic silence drives a credible renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is rooted in a clear familial wound that intensifies through tactile discovery. The grandfather's sacrifice—choosing disgrace to protect family—creates genuine moral complexity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through precise physical actions—the practiced grace of tuning, the reverent transcription with hidden ink.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his struggle against vanishing arts, with the rosette serving as a tangible anchor for his internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's unique ability to taste memories instead of flavors drives every crucial decision, particularly the pruning sequence where each cut is motivated by specific memory-tastes (betrayal's "sharp, metallic tang," apathy's "stale, cold water").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal tension against his desire to preserve wonder through indirect revelation. The shift from weary inspector to "person tasked with reminding a city how to feel again" shows earned character change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's grim optimism manifests through sustained mathematical obsession despite infinite imprisonment, with contradictory impulses (seeking texture of failure while risking self-unraveling) acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to weaponize their brokenness against Fear itself is compelling and earned through concrete embodied details like "frantic bird in a cage of bone."

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistently rooted in his role as "archeologist of abandoned dreams," with contradictory impulses (stoic surveyor vs. tender archivist) acting simultaneously throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is embodied through the brass lion drawer pull, creating layered internal conflict between past failure and present duty.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between sea-longing and land-bound guilt drives genuine conflict, with embodied details like "trembling hand" and the compass as "judge and jury."

    Elias's monastic ambition and embodied desperation under pressure are vividly rendered.

    Elara’s characterization is a standout strength, with her patiently strategic mind and selfless motivation ("her purpose had never been her own freedom") clearly established and embodied through her fluid, certain actions under pressure.

His motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" is dramatized through micro-choices like retrieving the specific seal and unbraiding the rope, culminating in an earned closure that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Operator's motivation is clear and grand, compelling high-stakes action. However, interiority remains distant and cryptic, lacking embodied contradiction or emotional texture under pressure. The final choice is earned but the internal cost is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)

    Elara’s motive—translating silence into music—drives concrete choices (donning the circlet, selecting the cereus, holding the “violet thread” under pressure). Internal conflict surfaces when the capsize terror intrudes and she must decide whether to falter or weave fear into beauty. Embodied perception via thermal color registers keeps feelings specific rather than labeled. The resolution’s peace is earned with visible cost (exhaustion) and a credible shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear, compelling motivation (“to give rest a permanent address”) drives concrete choices, and embodied weariness colors perception. The stubborn resolve is dramatized in the decision to “fold the world” despite known cost. Internal contradiction is faint—he’s resolute rather than torn—so the peak choice reads low‑friction. Still, actions align tightly with traits and culminate in an earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives (feed the community, then build intergenerational support) are clear and escalate credibly from suspicion to stewardship. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. hunger; secrecy vs. public declaration) surface in concrete beats. Interiority is specific (bell recognition triggers embodied memory) without therapy-speak. A deeper flaw or cost on the page for Elara would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is precise and pressurized: to locate “where unused love is stored,” and her choices (selecting the jasmine, fitting the tear, running the breath-method) align cleanly. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific (camera obscura as sanctum), with embodied ache and a credible, modestly costly reconfiguration at the end. The resolution leans a touch tidy—healing comes swiftly once the pattern appears—but it’s earned by the ritualized attempts. Contradictory impulses (wanting clarity vs. accepting mystery) operate simultaneously through the inhale/exhale device.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—“to discover the texture of time”—and it coherently drives his final tactic. Interiority is vivid and embodied via sensory images (hornbeam leaves as memory screens). The internal contradiction (monastic ambition vs. loss of self) is active and paid off in the final renunciation. Minor limitation: the lyric register slightly distances us from messy, contradictory impulses in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—protecting the seed vault over her own freedom—is clear and consistently drives her choices, and the chain functions as a lived constraint rather than a symbol only. Interiority is specific (her decade of study; the arrow’s cipher) but light on contradictory impulses, reading more as serene resolve than conflicted endurance. Micro‑choices (selecting keys, sequencing under pressure) align with her “patiently strategic” trait. The cost—remaining chained while victory occurs offstage—lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—finding the sound of trust breaking to contain it—is precise, personal, and sustained through micro‑choices (unsealing jars, focusing past the aurora). Interiority is embodied via synesthesia and specific absences, avoiding generic emotion labels. The internal contradiction—obsession to capture pain versus a need to heal—culminates credibly in choosing containment over re‑exposure. The cost lands when he endures the “grinding glass and tearing silk” before reaching earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—stealing “illuminated moments” to hear destiny’s tumblers—feels particular and carries through his choices. The internal shift from thief to “custodian of possibilities” is earned by the jar encounter, with the cost shown when his portraits go inert. However, pressure rarely exposes contradictory impulses beyond a brief “fear and exhilaration,” so struggle feels smoothed. More friction or a costed refusal would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to craft “safe zones for inquiry”) is clear and specific, and her theatrical self‑narration under stress reveals a character‑particular coping style. The bookmark micro‑trigger credibly liquefies long‑frozen grief and adds contradictory impulse at the moment of decision. Her decisive abandonment of the nascent lens reads as a values trade‑off with visible cost. Minor quibble: a few feelings are stated metaphorically rather than embodied at peak, but the interiority still tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (acrophobia, claustrophobia, the cast as a gut-punch), and the contradictory impulses (fear vs. focus) play on the page. The adaptive trait informs micro-choices (spotting the maintenance phone, refusing the chase). The protagonist’s stance shifts credibly from survival to identity-claim. Minor convenience in rapid decryption is outweighed by the emotional plausibility of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is precise and character‑specific—his cartographer’s compulsion to “map an endless night”—and his choices align with it. Interiority is embodied through sensory attention to varieties of silence rather than abstract label‑speak. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or friction beyond endurance; he rarely wavers, which limits depth of internal conflict. The ending’s Earned Stasis feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Unit 734’s motive—locating the origin of thought—drives every choice and culminates in the risky interface. The calm, methodical interiority is character‑specific and consistent with its “janitor” routine. Contradictory impulses (self‑preservation vs. knowledge) surface via the bypassed error warnings. Slight limitation: conflict remains largely conceptual, with little embodied struggle beyond the warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, credible motives (his yearning for transparency vs. his inability to speak) drive concrete choices; interiority is specific and embodied (“cool weight,” “lonely precision”). Contradictory impulses (spying to honor silence) operate simultaneously and culminate in a costly confession. Lena’s minimal on‑page presence still reads through charged actions (tickets, charcoal) without flattening into trope. The final exchange forecloses avoidance and earns a modest thaw with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives and methods are concrete and consistent, revealed through tactile ritual (marbles, polishing) and steady craft under pressure. His embodied choices align with his worldview, and the final deliberate crack reads as a modest but felt cost. Internal contradiction is limited—he rarely wavers—which keeps him a touch less complex than he could be. The manager’s on‑page pressure is brief but credible.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s competence and modesty meet Aris’s obsession in a clear, lived way; the lever pull is a concrete micro‑choice aligned with his “obliging” nature. Interiority is specific (hydraulic stains, quiet vertigo) and the final recalibration reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but gentle—obligation versus awe rather than a true bind—so pressure on character remains low. Relationship dynamics are effective but not transformative beyond Aris’s vindication.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—Elias wants to decipher the ghost’s message—and the key internal conflict (reverence for the artifact vs. willingness to damage it) crystallizes credibly into action. Embodied emotion and tactile choices (“lowered the antique opera program until its bottom edge kissed the dark water”) reveal character under pressure. The renunciation at the end (quest over; he will play) feels earned with visible cost (ruined program). Minor note: interior contradiction could surface a hair earlier to heighten tension sooner.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—her engineered tolerance for paradox versus the human ache to know—drives every micro‑choice, climaxing in the refusal to collapse the ambiguity. Embodied details (wool scratching, breath pluming, instrument sounds) ground emotion without label‑speak. The costed endurance (choosing to live with uncertainty) earns the final stasis. Minor note: “fault‑tolerant oracle” risks conceptual shorthand, but it’s dramatized through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is specific and sustained: he seeks a place heavy enough to reframe his secret, and his recklessness and skepticism shape micro-choices. Interiority is embodied (“porous and strange,” the beaded condensation, the cold dread), with a credible contradiction between rational scoffing and compelled engagement. The final choice—treating the haunting as a solvable problem and turning the valve—earns an endurance/renunciation of passivity with palpable cost. No false tidy absolution: he still carries the weight, now measured.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline (a keeper who must witness without judgment) and the pressure from Aeridor credibly forces a coping choice. The internal conflict—duty versus psychic survival—is dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (reaching for the box, folding, dipping fingers). The Earned Stasis at the end carries a felt cost in the admission that peace will crumble again. Slight neatness in emotional progression keeps it from feeling truly messy or dangerous under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (to nurture wonder) and Lena’s long-held grief are distinct and embodied through specific actions (the kalimba, the box, the hand to earth). Contradictory impulses surface credibly—Elias’s “cautious exuberance” versus restraint; Lena’s clutching versus her ultimate loosening. The change in Lena’s grip reads earned rather than declarative. Slight remove from Lena’s interiority keeps this shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (handling the pages, reading, juxtaposing diary and tapestry) align with his goal. Interiority is specific (“breath hitched,” the tactile feel of ink/pressure). Internal contradiction is minimal; he doesn’t wrestle with competing impulses so much as move toward a sober acceptance. The Earned Stasis—accepting he’s archivist not savior—lands credibly with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motives (artful problem-solving, control-at-a-distance) are clear and consistent, and his final renunciation—packing the bag and leaving—feels earned. Interiority is specific (binocular vigilance, the typewriter ritual) without therapy-speak. The internal contradiction (love of orchestration vs. urge to “transpose” his own life) is present but remains largely contemplative rather than pressured. A touch more friction in the decision to leave would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alistair’s motives and method are clear and character‑specific, and his micro‑choices (looping the hum, capturing “truth,” introducing a glitch) track cleanly under pressure. Interiority is mostly implied through action and diction rather than deeply dramatized, so internal contradiction remains subtle. Elara’s embodiment (white knuckles, shudder, ragged breath) gives the stakes texture. The piece leans toward competence over flaw, which slightly limits layered conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is precise and embodied—chronological homesickness drives an obsessive, tactile method—and his micro-choices under pressure (ignoring the spectacle to search inward, the final arcing line) feel earned. Contradictory impulses (grand conquest vs. quiet listening/acceptance) surface credibly in the last beat. Emotions are grounded in concrete sensorium (shell warmth, air pressure, hum). The endurance/renunciation at the end reads as an earned stasis with visible cost: fatigue and relinquishment of conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive—ending the loop by “conquering the labyrinth of self”—is clear and drives his choices, with a credible final renunciation (accepting the painful memory). Interiority includes tactile specifics (ozone, gritty tablet) that anchor emotion, though some abstractions (“procedural generation,” “algorithm”) temper immediacy. We get a believable contradiction—avoidance vs. surrender—resolved through an earned shift. The cost reads as emotional integration and loss of buoyancy (the gift) at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive to push back numbness is specific and embodied through tactile music, with concrete ties to the broken needle and stone floor. Interiority feels particular rather than generic, and micro‑choices (cradling the needle, lowering the stylus, staying in silence) align with motive. Internal contradiction is subtler—less push‑pull than a steady endurance—so the change reads as earned acceptance, not a reversal. The audience’s reactions refract her own arc without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and character-particular, filtered through his meteorological lexicon; curiosity and wariness coexist credibly as he approaches the pigeon. Micro-choices (handling the tube, interpreting the data, choosing a lateral approach) align with his traits. The conflict between guarding solitude and answering the data’s call is clear though the felt cost remains mostly implied. Still, the final decision reads earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—avoiding scent‑triggered memories yet choosing to confront them—reads specific and embodied. Micro‑choices (bringing the vial, sliding it under UV, refusing to recoil at the bloom) credibly escalate toward an earned acceptance. His “aromatically cautious” flaw complicates and then is confronted, with cost shown through tears and surrender. The interiority stays character‑particular without therapy‑speak or tidy platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (to “discover the texture of time”) is clear and consistently expressed through his study of the Lumin and the rope motif. His ethically playful turn of mind animates the dialogue (“library of burned books... single, pristine page”). Interiority is vivid if slightly abstract at times, with limited embodied stress. The final stance—choosing the threshold—reads earned by his prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—finding beauty as “quiet rebellion”—is clear and consistent, and her choice to offer sound without “shattering the hush” reveals a credible internal calculus. Interiority is embodied (hearing her own blood; arms aching) and not generic. The grandfather memory sharpens motive rather than substituting for it. Contradictory impulses are present but subtle (urge to break vs. to release).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—crafting a half‑truth at personal cost—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (subsuming the full memory, then teasing out joy) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The embodied emotional experience (“a current that raced up his arm... the cold, dense stone”) keeps emotions particular. His flaw (compulsive thoroughness) both enables and harms, culminating in a chosen cost (keeping the sorrow). The final renunciation (decanting joy, retaining residue) feels earned rather than neat.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivations are clear and particular: Elias’s drive to honor “silent contributors” aligns with his occupational lens, and Alina’s locket anchors lived grief. Interiority is credible (“cautious exuberance”) and embodied through small, telling gestures. The relationship dynamics are warm and specific, though Elias faces little real resistance, limiting layered contradiction under pressure. The final act reads earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s need to belong is concrete, character‑particular, and drives every choice from joining the search to the nocturnal labor of weaving mats. The internal contradiction—shyness versus “bold sympathy”—is dramatized rather than told, with embodied cues like the dropped reed‑bird and the climb to the fissure. His final dedication forecloses a path (purely solitary art) with a felt cost and gain. Lyra’s light touch adds relational pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation (finding the birthplace of echoes; protecting the city’s rhythm) is clear and his choice to “illustrate with consequence” feels character‑specific. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted—he pivots quickly once the pendant resonates, with little hesitation or competing impulse shown. Embodied perception is strong (canal’s waltz, pendant’s coolness), though his competence edges toward convenient clarity. The earned shift at the end reads as credible endurance/reframing rather than a profound internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motive—to map grief rather than “find” Lyra—is specific and coherently dramatized through tools and ritual, not declarations. Interiority stays embodied (wet limestone, chipped tiles, weight of absence) with a credible tension between analytical control and ache. The final Earned Stasis (peace, not happiness) feels earned, though there’s little visible resistance or failure before the lattice ignites. The character’s gentleness as method reads particular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s paradoxical drive—“to become visible to those who need you”—is dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (the grate, the timing, the placement on the laptop). His kindly methodical nature is embodied in tactile detail, not labels. The anonymity vs. impact tension carries through to the closing “quiet click” of satisfaction. Minor softness: his risk tolerance and fear of exposure could be sharpened on the page for added cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives (control vs. surrender) are distinct and embodied through tactile work (raw knuckles, tool choices) and plant-focused perception. The internal contradiction—imposing order while feeling fragile—acts on the page and culminates in a costly renunciation of “fixing.” The epiphany is earned via the observed linden leaf and tendrils rather than abstract declaration. Slight tidiness in the final stance keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s drive “to thresh meaning from experience” coheres with his sleepless, compulsive search and culminates in the ethically charged choice to trade the brooch for a story. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“a fool’s errand” to gulls) and actions align. The woman’s presence applies immediate pressure without caricature. The internal contradiction (austere skepticism vs. need for meaning) threads cleanly through the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s protectiveness, eroding certainty, and final renunciation are cleanly motivated and embodied through concrete sensory pressure (failed scrying, shadow‑images, the hand lowered). Her contradictory impulses—guardian vs. midwife of miracle—coexist in scene and resolve with cost (loss of clairvoyance/role). Kael is thinner but functions as a live counterforce and catalyst rather than a cipher. The epiphany risks neatness but is earned by the cave’s chosen method of “present‑truth” revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s vocation and quiet compulsion are clear and embodied in tactile habits, with the valve touch revealing his limited, sensory‑triggered insight. His choices (collecting, curating, inviting the woman to speak) align with motive and reveal character under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle—enduring solitude while serving communal memory—but not deeply dramatized. The brief relationship beat with the woman lands, though the test on him remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clean and persistent—honoring a mentor by finding the fortress—and actions align (reading cracks, using the punch). Interiority is particular enough (“analytically artistic mind,” “trembling certainty”), though conflict is mostly one‑sided resolve with limited contradictory impulses. The final acceptance lands as a credible evolution but registers minimal felt cost on the page. A touch more friction or doubt under pressure would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s skeptical rationalism versus grief-driven loyalty creates credible internal pressure, culminating in the near-throw of the tile and the pivot to transcription. Interiority is concrete (tactile tile, storm, whale calls) and choices track his values. The final acceptance feels earned rather than convenient. Slight sentimentality at the end is contained and character-grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (to end immortality) and a defined flaw (calcified boredom) drive his choices, culminating in the risk of the rift. Interiority is vivid but largely declarative and assured; there’s little on‑page hesitation or contradiction under peak pressure. The embrace of the curse is strong, though it comes swiftly and with minimal friction. The final step reads earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions—honest child of a grifter seeking an exact “fair trade”—are clear and embodied in her choices (the corpse-smuggling plan, using “The Ghost”). Her calm, ritualized craft under pressure shows character-specific behavior. A minor limitation: on-page inner friction during the operation is muted; she rarely wavers or missteps in the moment. Mr. Silus functions more as a catalyst than a pressure source on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—warding off the silence by capturing “textures of different times”—is clear and enacted through specific ritual. Interiority is particular (charts, frequencies, bonsai care) and embodied. However, contradictory impulses and on‑page cost are muted; she meets little internal resistance beyond solitude. The Earned Stasis at the end reads credible but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s compulsion to “layer” borrowed fragments to texture an erased self is clear, embodied, and particular. Contradiction—freedom in erasure versus ache for ownership—animates the central action. Micro‑choices (taking the woman’s grief, pairing it with the newborn’s hand, then returning the label to the tin) reveal a consistent value hierarchy. Slight passivity (no external risk) keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent: a myth buster forsaking career trappings to decode Thorne’s “ephemeral compass.” Interiority is particular (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “cheerful frustration”), and actions align with the pursuit. Internal contradiction exists—public debunker versus private restorer—though it could tighten under peak pressure. The final repricing is earned by his choices and temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motivation and internal split between anarchic love of the Revel and pragmatic survival are clear and consequential. His micro-choices—approaching Zola, choosing encoded order over open defiance—align with his “culture shock absorber” identity. The interiority is embodied (boots, calliope, stone chip) and character-specific. Cost is mostly anticipatory rather than paid on-page, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motives (legacy, purposeful curiosity) are clear and embodied through specific actions under cold, time pressure. Interiority is textured—reverence, melancholy, defiance—though internal contradiction is modest and rarely tests him. Micro‑choices (crushing the grain, timing the lure, shooting through the hush) align with motive. The emotional cost lands, but there’s little competing impulse beyond discomfort and secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are vivid and coherent, and her blindness meaningfully shapes method and choices. Interiority is mostly conveyed through tactile focus and breath control rather than thought, which suits her but limits contradictory impulses. Stakes drive clear micro‑choices (diagnose deeper fracture; patch plus reinforce) without visible moral trade‑offs. The emotional cost is implied more than felt beyond fatigue and time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s drive is clear and particular: a jaded atlas editor obsessed with a mythic hydrological origin. His dry wit (“Glad one of us enjoys the weather”) and ritual handling of the phrasebook embody character through action. The internal tension—skepticism versus faith in an impossible method—reads without therapy-speak. The redefinition from editor to “sole archivist” carries a real, character-level cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—restore the town’s “note” to rebalance a skewed world—is clear and enacted through specific, patient labor. Interiority stays character‑particular (craft, cadence, bodily hum) rather than abstract labels. Conflict is mostly endurance rather than contradictory impulses; the piece skimps on a sharper inner tension or visible cost beyond fatigue. Still, his micro‑choices of gait and route reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crisp and tethered to action: to “harness the ephemeral” outweighs survival, and the internal contradiction (flight vs. completion) is dramatized, not summarized. Embodied sensation (“priest’s bare feet,” “borrowed sorrow”) roots the mind-attack in the body. The decisive renunciation of survival for the vial reads earned, with visible cost. Minor risk: the perfection of serenity at the end slightly tidies the messiness of trauma just endured.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular: to escape a legacy of disbelief by claiming a true story, which compels the decision to break the seal. Interiority is vivid and embodied in how he reads the setting (“copperlight repose,” “shadows held their breath”). The internal conflict—truth versus being believed—registers, though it could tighten further at the moment of breaking the door. The final renunciation (accepting disbelief) lands as an earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s interiority is present and character‑specific, but he remains largely reactive; the ghost and the bloom drive the crucial turns. The motive (receiving/continuing a shared alchemical legacy) is clear and builds, yet contradictory impulses under pressure are limited. The epiphany via “final resonance” lands but leans on a memory download rather than a contested choice. Emotional embodiment (acidic dew, bone‑deep chime) elevates the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen’s drive is coherent and enacted under pressure, culminating in the conscious decision to anchor the dream-threads during the storm at bodily cost. Interiority is textured (“orchid solace”) and embodied, though his optimism rarely conflicts with counter-impulses beyond a brief panic. The profession-specific competence (wharf weaving) meaningfully shapes tactics. A touch more on-the-page contradiction would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to touch lineage and restore faith—is concrete and consistently drives her choices, and the ship etching reorients her belief without feeling unearned. Interiority is embodied through tactile work (freeing the stone) and sensory attention. Internal conflict is subtle (cautious enchantment vs. the risk of disturbing graves) rather than sharply dramatized, keeping the pressure quiet. The change at the end reads earned but low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motive—finding meaning in margins and protecting a client via analog stealth—is clear and coherently embodied in his choices (chalk, letter). Interiority is specific (clipboard as anchor, adhesive’s taste), but internal contradiction is light; he seldom doubts or struggles, so pressure reveals little new about him. The competence feels untested, creating a smooth arc rather than a crucible. Still, his values are legible and consistent, and the final renunciation of digital ease reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—listening for unheard stories—translates into concrete, high‑stakes action, and her cultivated foolishness is an operative trait, not a label. Competence (embroidery as code, timing the transmission) is balanced by believable caution and concealment, though internal contradiction is mild. The emotional embodiment is strong in tactile details (needle, silk, breath syncing with the hum) but there’s limited on‑page fear or self‑doubt during the peak. The final endurance stance—returning to stitch and wait—reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (to wrench truth at personal cost) and Kael’s (to find the breath before choice) are clear and embodied. Contradictory impulses—Kael’s love versus fear—surface in the condensation scene with credible pain. Elara’s “fierce tenderness” governs micro‑choices (stone to glass, whispering the name), aligning action and ethic. Kael’s interiority is mostly externalized through reaction, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and particular: translate not just language but fear and longing into leverage for peace. His contradictory impulses—mediator’s discretion vs. revealing a child’s “secrets”—play on the page and culminate in the risky choice to tell Varin about the thunder. Embodied details (the brain coral, generator hiss) root his anxiety. The General’s flicker of vulnerability registers as earned change in their relational dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s desire “to rediscover lost joy” is specific, embodied, and consistently drives his micro‑choices (gentling the light, using the shard as anchor). His frustration vs. patience conflict is enacted on the page rather than told. The final acceptance of joy’s fleetingness reads as an earned endurance with cost. Minor note: stakes stay inward, but the scene still wrings credible pressure from them.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “methodically playful” temperament governs his tactics—cataloging changes, testing angles, orchestrating a seven‑reflection sequence—and culminates in a charged refusal of predictability at the end. Interiority is concrete and embodied (smells, harmonics, tactile coin) with a credible shift from wanting to return to savoring questions. The apprentice provides light external pressure, but the crucible is largely internal, fitting the scope. The cost—forsaking the predictable cerulean—lands, if subtly scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent—guarding a “spark of defiance”—and he makes a risky, defining choice under pressure. Interiority is specific (the seed’s weight, the wilting sunflower as “a period”) and embodied. Internal contradiction is modest (fear vs. resolve) rather than deeply dramatized, and Aris functions mainly as a principled counterweight, not a crucible that forces a relational change.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motives are coherent and specific: she metabolizes sleepless isolation into poems, then reframes that drive in the “blossom armistice.” Contradictory impulses (longing vs. acceptance) act simultaneously and culminate in concrete choices—writing on the postcard and relocating it. Emotions are embodied via the shell’s acoustics and the sailors’ hearsay, avoiding therapy‑speak. The endurance choice (remaining awake, renouncing concealment) lands with felt cost scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motive—preservation with a tinge of resurrection—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (tuning pitch, deciding when to deliver the final note) align with it. Interiority is vivid but largely one‑note; we don’t see conflicting impulses beyond sorrow versus duty. Competence is high and struggle is mostly aesthetic rather than risky, slightly flattening pressure. Still, the closing “foxglove regret” registers a credible cost for his Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is specific and propulsive—repairing trust through perilous linguistic magic—and his “carefully reckless” nature governs his choices. Interiority is textured (fear of inadequacy, bone-deep agony) and embodied by the blood-ink praxis. The final charged moment (Elara’s hand to his) emerges credibly from his risk, though the cost remains mostly potential rather than felt. Minor tell-y lines (“His motivation was singular and sharp”) skim the surface but don’t blunt the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear from the opening and drives concrete, character‑specific actions (forensic reading of glue; using the private‑calibrated chain). Interiority feels embodied and technical, filtered through “pressure and release.” The contradiction—resentment vs yearning to understand—is active in the scene and earns the final reconfiguration. Small note: his competence makes the process smooth; a hair more visible struggle could deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief, ritualized control, and compulsive reinvention create a coherent, pressurized interior life that drives choices. Contradictory impulses (lying to protect himself vs. longing to preserve/ share Lena) act in scene and culminate in a credible, costly confession. Embodied actions (balancing, scrambling on the stool) reveal character under stress. The shift from protective fictions to vulnerability feels earned by Anna’s steady presence and the storm’s catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s curiosity-driven need to understand “why some thresholds feel sacred” credibly evolves into a costly choice to cross a one‑way gate. Interiority is particular to his lineage (maze architect father, pilot grandfather) and expressed through action (grain reading) rather than label‑speak. The contradiction—longing for connection vs. accepting necessary separation—is present and paid off. A shade more embodied conflict at the moment of crossing could further deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive (to belong by proving a living rhythm) is clear and carried through his quiet, pattern‑reading tactics; Elara’s curt pragmatism credibly softens into awe. The burnt feather anchors his interior life and reprises with a reweighted meaning at the end. Internal contradiction is modest (his calm vs. tremor), but the relationship shift functions as crucible. The epiphany edges tidy, yet feels earned by the orchestrated spectacle and shared breath.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—professional curiosity under a ticking clock—is clear and consistent, and their choices (using the seeds, studying the slash, pressing the glass) align with it. Interiority is specific enough to feel character‑particular rather than generic. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or felt personal cost; Kael remains competent and emotionally steady. The change at the end is insight rather than a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and small micro‑choices (the channel, the coin, the bishop’s angle) reveal a precise, idiosyncratic mind. Interiority is elegant but cool; we feel competence more than pressure or contradiction. The anonymity “applause he ever required” hints at renunciation but the cost is faint. Strong, specific, but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive—creation over defiance—is clear and specific, and his frustration at the elusive connection grounds the emotional stakes. Micro‑choices (he stops dancing to attend to the “gaps” between breaths/heartbeats) credibly reveal his temperament and method. Internal contradiction is mild (exile vs belonging through art), but the final renunciation of mere performance for being lands. The cost is largely conceptual rather than dramatized, slightly softening the character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motive—revealing value through light—drives every action, culminating in the renunciation of saving his atrium. Interiority is tactile and particular (calloused hands, stone‑ritual, reading the spaces between ripples). The internal conflict (preserve monument vs. honor flux) is dramatized rather than declared. The acceptance lands with credible cost (letting his life’s work go) without therapy‑speak shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive to “enlighten” rookies is clear and embodied through the scar, the careful handling of the box, and the relived decision in the fire. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular; the “split‑second bargain” shows value hierarchy under pressure. Kaelen is thinner but functions as a crucible and completes a felt shift. Minor on‑the‑nose moments (“Bargained innocence”) slightly flatten ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—engineering hope through repeatable “equations”—is clear and consistently enacted. Interiority is specific to her perceptual habits (drips, hum, needle), and the breath‑catch when the gauge dips provides embodied pressure. Internal contradiction is light; she is largely competent with little felt moral trade‑off beyond risk of failure. The closing stance shift (quiet satisfaction, planning the next attempt) is earned but modest in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive and method are precise and character‑particular, and her curiosity-to-ethics tension surfaces in the final renunciation. Interiority is embodied through tactile listening and careful handling rather than abstract labeling. The conflict remains quiet, so her struggle never quite bites hard enough to expose deeper contradiction. Still, actions align with motive and reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mirage painter’s motive is clear and specific—seed possibilities before the bells—embodied through his ritual. Interiority is restrained yet consistent with a figure whose art is service, not self. However, there’s little internal contradiction or on‑page cost beyond fatigue/anonymity, keeping the emotional range narrow. The final renunciation (leaving without acknowledgment) reads earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive and tactics are clear and consistent; his shift from “operatively gentle” to a firmer ritual act reads earned. The generals are archetypal but effective foils, with Kaelen’s tremor and Vorlag’s grudging surrender giving credible cost. Interiority leans more on controlled rhetoric than contradictory impulses, limiting depth. Still, micro‑choices (scraping dust, choosing symbol) reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vance’s contradiction—water baron and penitent aesthete—reads specific and embodied (“salt crystals biting,” trembling fingers). His motive is clear and morally knotted, and the act of dissolving the last egg visibly costs him. The choice feels decided before arrival, limiting on‑page struggle, but the execution still reveals a credible hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids therapy‑speak and stays character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices in the rite (the sequence of knots) align with her purpose. However, she reads near‑mythic and under‑conflicted: “alarming serenity” dominates without a credible contradictory impulse on the page. The chastity/mystique frame is intriguing but never pressures her with a live cost. Strong embodiment in the dance, but the internal struggle feels pre‑solved.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑specific interiority with credible contradiction (serenity vs the “first tremor of doubt”). The alder story stick and the hollow‑eyed spectator concretize his ethical stakes. His decision to “reverse its trajectory” is earned and forecloses a prior path without neat self‑absolution. Minor note: a few theme-forward declarations brush close to discursiveness but remain grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular—he refuses the savior role and commits to honoring, which governs every choice. Interiority is spare but specific, filtered through tactile action (moss, vines, knots) rather than abstract feeling. A mild limitation is the lack of a sharper internal contradiction on the page; he rarely wavers. Still, his accelerated work at the end reads as a credible intensification of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clean and compelling, grounded in past failure and forgiveness, and his technically gentle craft choices reveal character under pressure. The piece shows embodied emotion (snowmelt ardor against the cold) without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is subtle—desire to restore sound vs. acceptance of honoring with light—and lands credibly at the end. The cost is quiet but legible: relinquishing the return of voice for a memorial image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s fractured perception (“only ever existed in the before and the after”) yields clear motive and a specific flaw that shapes choice under pressure. His internal contradiction—custodian of the past vs. willingness to break the glass and ingest the seal—reads earned through the dream-led reframe. Embodied stakes surface in tremor, grit, water, and the moth‑wing texture. The final acceptance carries cost without feeling tidy or therapeutic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kavi’s frugality and scientific rigor drive his choices with admirable consistency, and the “empirically ironic” push toward miracle feels character‑true. Interiority is specific (silence and starlight as hoarded resources) with concrete micro‑choices in the ritual. The internal contradiction (skeptic’s method for a mystical aim) is present but rarely stressed under pressure, so conflict feels smooth rather than contested. The renunciation at the end reads earned but the cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive and method are crisp and consistent—“a schemer who built cures instead of weapons”—and her choices drive the scene. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she never wavers or shows embodied doubt beyond persistence, which smooths complexity. Emotion is rendered at a high level of abstraction (cellular memory, resonant frequencies) rather than visceral stress. The final endurance and fading cost read earned but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to momentarily resurrect her father’s lost vision—is clear, embodied, and enacted through specific craft choices. Her steadiness versus desperation gives quiet tension without melodrama. The tear freezing and her calm acceptance at the end read as an Earned Stasis with cost. Slightly limited internal contradiction keeps it just short of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motives (duty, pride, hurt paternal love) are clear and sharpen under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation of force for support. His contradictory impulses—clinging to tradition versus honoring Lyra’s view—act in scene and drive the final choice. The visible cost (abandoning his tools’ primacy, leaving the ribbon) reads. The only limiter is the neatness of the epiphany’s timing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelen’s compulsion to understand versus the rule “never try to understand” creates a credible internal contradiction that drives his micro-choices (retreating to the bathroom, focused inquiry, accepting conduithood). Embodied details (headache “like trying to remember the future,” hands on ceramic, water as nebulae) ground emotion. The final renunciation of a creator’s agency for a conduit’s role reads earned, though the on‑page cost is subtle rather than scarring. Overall, the motivation is clear and consistent, with a meaningful before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained, and her methodical intelligence reads in action (researching absences, presenting an argument). Interiority is specific—fear, urgency, and professional bias toward pattern—but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers. The negotiation scene provides embodied risk but little moral or relational cost. Her final commitment feels earned, if emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and felt—she seeks the Garden to recover her twin’s identity—and her micro-choices (each swatch use) reveal layered, contradictory impulses (desire to know him vs. the erosion of her own memories). Interiority is embodied and specific: salt-and-rust air, corroded gates, bodily tremor at “Ocean’s Heart.” The final renunciation (memorial over recovery) is earned by the preceding attempts and their costs. A faintly declarative sentence or two (“She finally understood.”) nudges toward telling but doesn’t undercut the earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—turning confusion into clarity—is precise and consistent, and his micro‑choices (retrieving the seal, selecting the rope, weaving into the governor) align with a “warmly methodical” temperament. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he meets the impossible with competence but little visible doubt or competing impulse. The result is credible but emotionally low‑amplitude. The ending shows earned endurance rather than a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and embodied—an aging specialist driven to carve silence out of assaultive noise. Interiority stays grounded in tactile acts (reading ice fractures) rather than abstraction. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he’s resolute with little ambivalence or moral friction, so the arc leans competence over struggle. The earned repose lands, but the personal cost feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motive—proving pattern and rekindling connection—is clear and consistently drives his choices. The hesitation before placing the shard of hush provides credible internal conflict and cost. Interiority is specific (retrovisions, “thistle‑blown hope”) and embodied through action. A relationship crucible is absent by design but the solitude functions as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority—“preemptively nostalgic” is embodied rather than labeled—and micro‑choices under pressure culminate in an earned renunciation. His methodical urgency during the lightning‑measured sequence reveals competence tinged with desperation. The final choice to archive the choice, not the trauma, forecloses a path and feels character‑true. Minor note: his leap from data to thesis is swift but still grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive (seeking a cure for the hush) is clear and embodied through his profession and rituals; discouragement vs. persistence creates a credible interior pressure. The rag knot crystallizes his method and reveals character via choice. We don’t see deep contradiction or a costly personal flaw confronted, but the endurance and reorientation feel earned. The final renunciation of a “single formula” for a pattern is a believable, character‑driven shift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her tidal‑pool habits filter perception, and the jade cicada anchors her micro‑choices. The contradictory impulses (hurt vs. observational detachment) play simultaneously and culminate in an earned renunciation. The choice to recast the relationship carries a visible cost (letting go of “sharp‑edged proximity”) that aligns with her established traits. Kael’s presence provides relational pressure without stealing POV clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s fear of enclosure versus hunger for “the infinite” creates a clean, lived contradiction, and his micro‑choices (opening the hatch, holding up the doll, pushing off the trellis) align with motive under pressure. Embodied responses (“lungs seized,” the “weight of his own body”) ground emotion. The final acceptance—carrying the trellis’s silence back—reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a tidy cure. Slightly insulated from sharper moral cost because the father is off‑page, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motive is lucid and embodied in his tactics, and the passenger’s fear is credible and specific. However, Elian experiences little internal contradiction or cost; he functions more as a serene guide than a pressured agent. The woman’s shift is earned on the page, but it’s relatively frictionless. The line “His core motivation was simple” reads thesis-like and slightly flattens character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—save the system by locating the stairway—drives every action, and her “wisely adventurous” temperament is dramatized via sonic problem‑solving over force. Interiority is specific enough (sensory recall of “sonic architecture,” measured patience) though contradictions are light; she remains highly competent with limited visible struggle. The renunciation of a crown in favor of memory as sovereignty reads earned but low‑cost. A touch more friction or doubt under the clock would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—mercy through severance—is clear and embodied in the ritual action with the ring and scar, showing tenderness and severity at once. Liam’s unlocking breath reads earned via the shared scar trigger and memory of the oak, not as an unearned epiphany. The cost to Elara (self‑imposed isolation, careful burning) is felt though somewhat abstracted. Minor ding for the relative smoothness of Liam’s shift, which borders on tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—translating pressure into value after OmniVex—drives every choice and culminates in the bolt act. Her contradictory impulses (temptation of the Promise vs. disciplined resolve) are embodied and credible under pressure. The lie about being “resistant” shows virtuously mischievous agency tied to risk. Emotional texture is concrete and particular, with the bolt anchoring her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—uncovering the dynasty’s hidden truth—is clear, embodied through tactile ritual and sustained focus. Interiority is specific (hum in the bones, golden shadows), and actions align with motive. Contradiction is subtler (drive to know vs. the cost of relinquishing legacy), but present. The final acceptance reads earned by the ritual’s pressure rather than unearned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s goal and ethos are clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (studying the program, timing the release) align with his steward’s motive. Interiority is present in tactile ways (“silent panic of the glass panes,” the warmth of the open clasp) but shows little contradictory impulse beyond quiet fear versus duty. The renunciation—severing a symbiotic tether—lands as a credible cost but could register more ambivalently in his body or thought. Overall strong, if somewhat assured, under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—professional curiosity braided with grief guides micro‑choices (separating the form, unfurling the corner, ceremonially sleeving the button). The contradiction between personal ache and meticulous care is dramatized rather than told. Her final act (transcribing the message and officially reuniting object and file) reads as an earned stance, not a tidy cure. The cost remains present (“not healed”), which grounds the change.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character-specific: an underestimated archivist choosing endurance over fantasy victory. Interiority is embodied (“pressure change,” the key as the last solid thing) and her micro-choices (crowd-blending, puddle-map, lever) align with a quiet, careful resourcefulness. Internal contradiction is limited—resolve dominates—but the Earned Stasis of “holding the line” reads credible with felt risk. A touch more on fear vs. duty in-scene could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular (to hush the coded prophecy) and embodied through tactile anchors (mother‑of‑pearl keys, breath in chill). Interiority leans melancholy duty with an undercurrent of nostalgia; contradiction is present but subdued (protecting a memory vs. a future). Micro‑choices (playing “through negative space,” sustaining pauses) reveal values under pressure. The cost reads as ongoing loneliness rather than a sharp wound, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motive—decoding the leaves—guides concrete choices (sorting, monument‑building, the final prod). Interiority is textured and embodied (“mossy delight,” soil‑stained hands), but contradictory impulses under pressure are faint; he rarely hesitates or risks a loss beyond identity shift. The transformation is credible yet low‑cost on the page. The absence of a second character reduces crucible pressure but suits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motives and worldview are clear and specific, and his micro-choices (prying the stone, improvising the pivot, aligning the rose) align with his compulsion to “read” broken systems. Interiority is textured without therapy-speak, though internal contradiction is mild—he rarely wavers or pays an evident price beyond a quiet renunciation. Competence slightly outpaces struggle (he “understood instantly”), softening pressure. The final acceptance reads earned, if emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motive—to redeem his failure by understanding the “weight of names”—is clear, character‑particular, and governs every action. The balance he must maintain (grief vs. joy) provides credible internal tension without melodrama. Micro‑choices mostly compress into ritual execution rather than varied tactical decisions, but the embodiment (sweat, energy drain) keeps it grounded. The final renunciation (not bringing her back) reads earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive (a “spiritual midwife” integrating laughter into healing) is clear and consistent, and his small, tactile choices with the crocodile tooth reveal character. His calm under pressure and gentle insistence with the spirit read credible, though internal contradiction and felt cost are light. The spirit’s flicker from pain to memory creates a live relational crucible that tests his approach. The resolution feels earned but a touch frictionless emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Embodied interiority is vivid and character‑particular (“micro‑gram accuracy,” ankle‑angle memory triggers). The paradox of “displaced rooted” creates live contradiction that informs micro‑choices (brace vs. flee). Motivation is coherent—shift from escape to “mathematics of mercy”—and aligns with actions. The cost of accepting the crucible rather than escaping is felt but could be sharpened with one concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is strong and consistent—she’s dedicated to honoring overlooked histories—and her actions align tightly with that. Interiority is specific (the lens as “anchor,” the tactile “wrenching pull”), though internal contradiction is minimal; she reads as highly competent with little real doubt. Micro‑choices (following the lens’s tug, selecting the flawed seascape, committing to the unfastening) reveal priorities. The felt cost is present but modest, keeping the arc credible yet not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leo’s motive—“to discover what ceilings hide”—is clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially at the engage/refuse fulcrum. Interiority is concrete (dust patterns, bodily chill, steady heart) without therapy‑speak. The internal tension is modest but present (leave vs. engage), and the final act credibly aligns with his established trait of observant curiosity. The cost is quiet rather than piercing, but appropriate for the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is explicit and coherent (“compress eternity into a moment”), and actions align with that aim through concrete choices (uncorking the vial, guiding frost). Interiority skews conceptual rather than embodied, with minimal contradictory impulse or felt hesitation at the point of no return. The “face unreadable” choice dampens emotional specificity when cost peaks. Still, the character’s austere, ritualized agency reads consistent and credible for this voice and scale.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s motives and interiority are clear and specific: a failed revolutionary turned archivist who needs to reframe a civilization’s legacy. His micro‑choices (covering mirrors, leaving the shard exposed, deciding to “devise” proof) align with his poet’s bias and risk tolerance. Internal tension (idealism vs. academic rigor; grief vs. resolve) is present but could surface more dynamically in the heat of the squall. The earned shift toward a “quiet war of interpretation” reads credible for his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive and craft-identity are crystal: a humble repairman tasked with retuning the world. The internal conflict lands when the rust’s lie makes his finger slip and the chip dulls, then resolves through a grounded return to “the pure…joy of making something right.” Emotions are embodied via tactile action (wires, screws, hums) rather than labels. The arc is modest but credible, with endurance through humility rather than grand heroics.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific, and her sensory obsession credibly drives each choice. The internal contradiction—collector versus renouncer—surfaces at the lagoon and pays off in a concrete action. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“less of earth and more of starlight and stone”). Slight softness: the ordeal feels relatively easy, minimizing visible strain before the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and embodied: an artist who reads the coast and acts under pressure, shifting from panic to purposeful labor. Her competence is earned by prior habits (“perpetually learning,” grandfather’s projector) and her micro-choices remain tactile. Internal contradiction is light—she hesitates only for a heartbeat—so we don’t see deep cross-pressures, but the clarity fits the length. The final repricing of her vocation feels earned by action rather than declared alone.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her patience and craft-forward problem‑solving feel character‑specific. The weeks of observation and the careful light‑filter choreography show micro‑choices aligned to her quiet drive. Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal cost beyond time and obsession. The realization about inheritance lands but reads more as revelation than a conflicted choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive (uncovering Elara’s truth) is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices under pressure (dismantling prior queries; reassembling a new, aftermath‑focused “statement”) reveal values and adaptability. Embodied stress (“searing reverie,” trembling fingers) grounds emotion. The despair/persistence contradiction is credible and active in scene. The endurance cost feels earned and specific to his flaw‑turned‑tool (retrocognition).

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is precise and compelling—authentic revival over hollow replication—and his method exposes intimate interiority through concrete sensory fragments. The temptation of despair vs. chosen endurance creates credible tension, and exhaustion registers in the body. The lack of a second on‑page character limits relational crucible, but the internal stakes still sharpen. The final renunciatory commitment reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s vocation, ritual method, and oath frame a clear inner conflict that sharpens into a renunciation: he resolves to starve the coming silence by making the city forget. The emotional turn credibly costs him his life’s purpose. Interiority is specific (foghorn memory, tactile wax work) rather than generic. Slight limitation: we don’t yet see contradictory impulses collide on the page beyond the swift pivot from archivist to saboteur of feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in legacy and understanding, and her “furiously tranquil” stance reads character‑particular. Interiority is embodied through sensory focus (gathering scents, laughs, ozone) rather than labels. However, internal conflict is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a felt personal price beyond concentration. The closing realization is earned but safe, with little moral or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motive—favor listening over noise—threads cleanly from curiosity into a decisive act. Interiority is specific (the bell rope, the “song” under storms), but internal contradiction is mild; he’s steady rather than torn. Embodied pressure is present through tactile choices (hand on console, pull on rope), though the felt cost remains mostly implied. Strong character-through-action with limited ambivalence at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—seeking strength through vulnerability—is clear and drives his decisive act of “pressing the yellow lantern glass to the main eyepiece.” Interiority is embodied (“breath fogging the cold metal”), and the empathy sequence shows contradictory impulses (terror/resignation/glory) coexisting. The final repricing of dust reads earned by his prior ritualistic discipline. A touch more in‑scene friction before the choice would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motive—hoarding unspoken words as a misguided sacrament—is clear, character‑specific, and pressures his choice to open the box. Interiority is embodied (clumsy fingers, reverence “like trespass”), and the flaw meaningfully complicates his tactics. The final renunciation carries cost: relinquishing the “prettier cage” and, by freeing Lyra, accepting a reconfigured solitude. Minor softness: his shift is swift but earned by accumulated cues rather than a single voiced epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation is vivid and consistent—his hunger to “feel the texture of time” drives every choice. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (e.g., holding the urn shard for hours), with desperation shading into reverent attentiveness. Contradictory impulses are present but muted; we get yearning vs. mortality, yet little on‑page struggle beyond the final pivot. The final serenity reads earned, though the cost—the soft extinguishing of his gnawing drive—could be more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motive—finding beauty in the incomplete—clearly drives his choices (not comforting the child, searching the tideline, pocketing the feather). Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile detail rather than label-speak. The renunciation of direct comfort is a credible, character-true choice, though internal contradiction is minimal. The change is quiet but earned: he converts observed loss into a tempered, personal composition.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—engineering communion before his deadline—reads clear, particular, and consistent with his caretaker identity. Embodied details (calloused finger, weakening body, deliberate craft) ground emotion without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is muted; calm defiance largely replaces tension, so pressure feels more devotional than conflictual. Still, the final renunciation—sinking into the unified rhythm—feels earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is specific and credible, with a live tension between skepticism and the pull of ritual. His micro‑choices (following the footprints, entering the tower, placing the amber) align with his motive to “understand” while revealing contradiction. Emotions are embodied through sensory perceptions and tactile handling of the amber. The final renunciation is modest but earned, with a visible cost in surrendering a cherished emblem of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and specific—atonement through planting—and actions align tightly with it. Interiority is textured (listening to “dead languages,” reverence with the satchel), though true contradiction or internal friction is light. The small cost (aching back, lighter satchel) supports an earned endurance stance. Lack of on‑page counterpressure or doubt keeps the arc contained rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—bridging distance into closeness—drives concrete choices (tinkering, decoding, leaving safety) and reads as embodied through tactile anchors (the waxed leaf, the cylinder). Her quiet despair/hope oscillation is credible, especially at the “sound as empty as the wasteland itself” moment and the brief despair at the fissure. The relationship with Barrow becomes a functional crucible that alters tactics without sentimentality. If anything, the arc feels relatively unopposed; the piece could bear one sharper internal contradiction or cost to reach the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—seeking a fixed point amid temporal distortion—is clear and drives her choices (returning to the ritual, focusing on the pulsar). The internal contradiction (yearning for “true north” vs. accepting boundless chaos) culminates in a credible reorientation. Emotions are embodied through tactile anchors (charcoal grit, cold plating, ozone‑scented jacket). The shift at the end feels earned by the mounting sensory and cognitive strain.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive (an “apprentice of wonder” seeking to amend, not steal) is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (using awe to distract, choosing a seed over control) reveal character. However, interior contradiction is minimal and he meets little resistance; competence dominates struggle. Sylas’s brief turn is affecting but lightly sketched. The final renunciation (planting growth over control) feels earned but low‑cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (from paid grief to witnessing and acting through “small gestures”) are specific and drive micro-choices—the stepping code, the refusal to speak, the weaponized authenticity of tears. Her contradiction (former crisis actor vs. real survivor) is dramatized rather than told. The Regent’s “benevolent ruthlessness” is credible and complicated by her flinch. The only ding is the speed of the Regent’s reversal, which skims the edge of convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—“a low, constant pressure in her chest, a hidden thunder”—and her micro‑choices (seeking the aviary, choosing the feather, risking the attempt) arise organically from fear and need. The contradiction between burying her gift and longing for “the shape of home” is active on the page and resolved via an earned, quiet shift. Disappointment at the inert stone and the trembling before the attempt show credible cost. The final renunciation of drifting (and acceptance of groundedness) is motivated and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt-driven motivation is precise and embodied through tactile habits (the labyrinth) and disciplined attention to the tapestry. The pride-versus-duty contradiction operates in scene and culminates in a choice to accept the “simple, defensive move.” Actions align with his flaw and its renunciation; the cost is the surrender of brilliance. A slight tendency toward explicit moralizing softens the rawness of the final admission.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive and temperament are specific and consistent—playful defiance harnessed to a craft-based tactic. Interiority is embodied through how she “rides the canyon’s currents” and tunes diction to the acoustics. Minor on‑the‑nose lines (“Forgiveness shouldn’t have a price”) shave subtlety, and internal contradiction is lightly sketched rather than dramatized. The closing acceptance of capture reads as an earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive (to conjure meaning at the edge of oblivion) is clear and escalates under the breath-clock and the Great Silence. Her doubt vs. devotion is dramatized in embodied ways (trembling, tight chest, hovering hand). The final surge “born of love rather than skill” credibly resolves her inner conflict without feeling pat. A slight ease comes from the magic granting breath back, but the emotional price has already been paid.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—fulfilling a private promise—drives each micro‑choice and coheres with his painter’s eye and reserve. Interiority is concrete and embodied (the shell’s ridges, the cave air), avoiding therapy‑speak. The internal conflict is quiet rather than oppositional; inevitability replaces struggle, slightly lowering tension. The earned renunciation at the pool lands with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is precise and embodied—he wants to prove whispers can guide where shouts fail—and his choices (cork to lens, narrowing intent to “something lost to be found”) align. Interiority is vivid and particular (scent-memory as safety), though internal contradiction is minimal; he never truly doubts. The Hemlock dynamic enriches pressure by contrast, but Hemlock is offstage, limiting relational crucible. Cost is mostly emotional exertion and self-abnegation of ego, felt but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, compelling motive (build a beacon to answer grief) with embodied emotion (“tears trace paths,” the censer’s hum) and coherent choices. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—purpose versus the ache of loss—without a sharp on‑page dilemma. The final acceptance (he can’t bring his daughter back) reads as an earned endurance/renunciation with felt cost. A slightly deeper clash of impulses in the rooftop moment could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—he craves psychological safety—and actions (truthful bartering, using the relic) align under pressure. The internal contradiction (absolute honesty vs the wish to guard a private memory) drives his choice in the storm. Embodied emotion shows in tactile details (cold glass at the temple, wind stealing words). The ending’s earned stasis—accepting partial truth—feels paid for by a “gentle severance.”

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s compulsion to decode the gesture is clear and rooted in his solitary, observant nature; the duty-to-light vs. compulsion tension adds nuance. Interiority is concrete (“man made of absences,” the tactile handling of the boutonnière) and character‑particular. The change at the end (curating the flower as a monument) reads as a credible endurance/renunciation with emotional cost. Slightly limited by low external pressure and minimal contradiction beyond a gentle pull between vocation and obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief‑driven, empirically intuitive nature is dramatized through concrete tactics (sugar trails, maps) and a credible renunciation at the end. Interiority is specific and embodied (the “patience of a glacier,” the chip warming in his palm). The final refusal forecloses a fantasy of alternate lives with a felt cost. Slight neatness in the epiphany keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s disenchantment and compulsion toward the grotto play against a dawning duty, creating credible, simultaneous contradictory impulses. Her micro‑choices (ordering the departure, continuing the climb, reaching toward the light, then refusing) are motivated and embodied. The relationship with Kael adds precise pressure without stealing agency. The renunciation feels earned and carries a visible cost: she keeps the “cage” and assumes a new burden.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—bottling presence—drives concrete choices under pressure, culminating in dropping the nautilus and changing method. Interiority is textured and embodied (cold talisman, dust crunch, tear), with credible contradiction between her perfectionism and sudden improvisation. The renunciation feels earned by Kael’s revelation and their history embedded in tactile detail. A hair of tidiness in the speed of her self-revision slightly softens the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, specific interiority (jealousy of past selves, “feral nostalgia”) drives micro‑choices from pushing the scroll away to entering a trance and finally recommitting to write. Contradictory impulses (resentment vs longing for integration) operate simultaneously. The final stance shift feels earned by the embodied flight beat. Slight neatness to the epiphany, but it’s grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and specific—reclaiming purpose after anosmia by “humanizing” objects—and her actions (closing her eyes, reading wear patterns) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular, with the tremor and tactile focus grounding emotion. The on‑page relationship with the old man carries authentic mutual vulnerability. The final shift feels earned, though the resolution edges tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation and contradiction are clear: a logic‑driven scholar forced to try a folk superstition when stress literally crystallizes in his body. His micro‑choices (setting aside ink, re‑purposing the quill, naming each scar) reveal values under pressure and a credible cost to pride. Embodied emotion is specific (held breath, spreading frost‑like lattice) rather than generic. The change feels earned, though the resolution tilts a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Julian’s motive (an overdue apology before the orchard’s destruction) is clear and embodied, with credible sensory overwhelm during the ritual. His contradiction—wanting reconnection but accepting imperfect closure—lands without sentimentality. Madame Vex’s presence applies pressure and her status dynamic is legible. Minor limitation: Julian’s flaw set is narrow; we glimpse guilt more than a textured pattern of self-sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, compelling motivation—unify with the hush—drives continuous micro‑choices (spiral walk, dictionary consultation, final renunciation). Interiority is specific and embodied for a lyric mode, though emotions skew conceptual over visceral. The lingering individuality vs. dissolution provides credible tension. The final cost (selfhood surrendered) reads earned by the established ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are precise and character‑particular: a craftsman’s devotion in tension with a metaphysical curiosity. The ritual of counting, the grandfather’s key, and the embodied diagnostic all reveal layered interiority under pressure. His final renunciation (choosing not to “correct” the flaw) is earned and forecloses a path. The only limitation is that the cost of that choice remains mostly conceptual rather than materially felt.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—to solve grief by physics—flows cleanly into his choices, and the renunciation lands with embodied cost (“a profound exhaustion…extinguishing the quiet wildfire”). His spatial perception becomes a character‑specific way of seeing and acting. The internal conflict (help her pass vs. hold on) is present but underplayed at the peak; he never truly falters. Even so, reactions to the button and barrier reveal a coherent, particular interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motives—logic as bulwark against her father’s chaos—are clear and consistently tested by the subway quest. Contradictory impulses (need for certainty vs. attraction to the father’s intuitive map) coexist on the page, culminating in the lantern‑lighting. Interiority is specific (probability professor lens) and embodied via object interactions. The closing acceptance carries a felt cost without tidiness: she widens perspective without becoming him.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motive is precise and consistent, and his tactics under pressure (looping language, withholding comfort) reveal character. Interiority is cool but specific, avoiding therapy-speak while showing a disciplined estrangement that costs him connection. The caller’s presence applies pressure but remains a voice, limiting relational dynamism. Contradictory impulses are muted; this reads as earned endurance rather than change.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and enacted on the page (preserve small moments → restore the photo → go to the jetty). Interiority is textured through craft-specific perception, but contradictory impulses are limited; she rarely hesitates or faces a live trade-off beyond procedural risk. The final stance—exultant yet haunted—lands credibly from prior beats. Tomas functions as a mirror rather than a pressure source, keeping the relational crucible modest.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s motive and contradiction (desperately jocular yet aching for connection) are vivid, and his decisive choice to forgo the moon‑rock “miracle” for human risk reads earned. Interiority is specific (“a lump of the loneliest place imaginable”) and action aligns with need. The visible cost is the renunciation of the talisman and exposure to awkward social stakes. Secondary characters serve as pressure rather than fully drawn foils, but that’s apt for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive—seeking the Stillpoint to ease grief—is clear, embodied, and drives every choice. Interiority is textured through tactile listening and the ring’s cues, not labels. The internal contradiction (craving silence vs. discovering harmony) lands credibly at the end. Slight risk of tidiness in the acceptance beat, but it feels earned by the journey’s specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s guilt-driven motive and contradictory impulses (to fix vs. to accept) are concrete and character‑particular. His embodied stress (“knot of guilt,” hunched posture) and micro‑choices at the console under pressure feel earned. The renunciation at the end forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor note: one line (“professional posture one of being confidently uncertain”) risks label over show but is supported by later action.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motive—to translate silence into music—is clear and embodied through tactile actions (camera clicks, hand‑signs). Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than abstract, with a credible push from Lyra’s urging. Internal contradiction exists (joy in finding vs sorrow in loss), though it remains more conceptual than behaviorally conflictual. The final endurance/renunciation is felt via Lyra dissolving, but his struggle rarely bites back beyond lyric resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motive (recovering Elara’s erased truth) is clear and intensifies as he discovers her marks, with embodied emotion (“tenderness so fierce it threatened to crack his ribs”) balancing the volcanic rage. Contradictory impulses (hot anger vs. intuitive restraint) act in scene and drive the key choice. The final renunciation of fire for creation feels earned by his pattern‑reading and her anticipations. Slightly tidy self‑summarizing lines temper the messiness of human contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—to reclaim a shared dream through art as protest—is clear and embodied in micro-choices (sneaking out, choosing the slab, escalating the rhythm). Interiority is specific (the “last untangled piece of him” as heartbeat) and actions align with grief that is both burden and fuel. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (rebellion vs. yearning), keeping her human without tidy resolution. The earned stasis at the end—duet for one—lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s quiet competence, superstition-pragmatism (the Gemini coin), and lived knowledge motivate clean, purposeful choices; Kaelen functions as a status foil. Interiority is implied more than dramatized, with minimal contradictory impulses under pressure. The lack of visible struggle softens the felt cost of his win. Still, actions align crisply with a coherent value hierarchy (whispers over shouts).

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive and method are precise and consistent, and their micro-choices (shutter adjustments, mirror angle) reveal character under pressure. The interiority is restrained yet particular—silent empathy rather than therapy-speak. However, there’s little contradiction or visible cost in their calm competence; no real struggle tests their limits. The ending’s “promise” signals endurance but not a sharpened internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation and tactic—Elias seeks to seed “second thoughts” through a quiet, communal act—ground the POV. Interiority is specific (hearing “the chord” of the town) and actions align with motive (grotto trip, stone, timing). Internal contradiction is lighter; fear and risk remain mostly implied rather than embodied with visible on‑page cost. Still, his micro‑choices under pressure feel coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive (freedom vs. cage) is clear and embodied from the opening; Elara’s “combative tenderness” adds pressure and human friction. The scrimshaw’s effect coaxing her honesty creates a credible micro-turn in their relationship. Kaelen’s internal conflict is light—he’s largely resolute—but the relational cost (leaving Elara) is felt. The final refusal to look back reads as earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is precise and embodied: the “stage whisper” ritual vs. the silent whittling renders a live contradiction between performance and private grief. Motivation—cultivating lightness to survive the mandate—drives concrete micro-choices (narrate, then refuse to narrate). The guilt over Mara adds moral complexity that sharpens each act. The final placement of the bird is an earned endurance/renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and character‑specific—an aesthetically driven poet seeking resonance rather than rebellion—and his tactics (paraphrase, dissolution of self) align. Interiority is embodied (“feeling in the teeth,” “bone‑deep conviction”) and consistent with his sensibility. However, internal contradiction is muted; risk and fear of madness are named but not meaningfully contested on the page. The change at the end reads earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motives (finding beauty in imperfection, helping Lyra) are clear and embodied through his plant‑reading and barter idea. The relationship with Vex adds pressure without melodrama, and his “innocently cunning” solution reads character‑true. However, internal contradiction is light and the choice carries minimal personal cost; he never risks much beyond effort. The final “masterpiece” realization lands, but it isn’t earned through a difficult renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motive is clear and consistent, and his patience-driven temperament credibly fuels the methodological pivot. Interiority is present but largely serene; we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure, just a steady competence. The key micro-choices—mounting the lens, choosing a sine wave, retuning to photons—align with his values. Emotional cost is mostly conceptual (relinquishing “sound” for “light”), which reads elegant but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clean and particular—Elias’s grief-transformed craft meets the withering stranger—and his micro‑choices (folding cranes, foxes, lotus; finally spending the stencil) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile metalwork and the vellum’s history, avoiding therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction (clinging to pain vs. risking it to reach another) is present but subtle rather than dramatized under acute pressure, keeping this short of superb. The final renunciation—repurposing Anya’s stencil—lands as an earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s methodical, ethically charged curiosity and her decision to confide form a coherent, specific character; Julian’s need to understand is clear but thinner. Interiority is implied through action and craft objects rather than over‑explained. A modest cost is present in revealing the father’s legacy and burden. Internal contradiction is light, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive—to risk herself for forbidden knowledge—is clear and embodied, with contradictory impulses (ecstasy vs. dissolution) coexisting in the act. Micro‑choices (avoiding patterns, continuing as pain and joy intensify) reveal values and cost. The final renunciation—accepting vesselhood—reads earned by the preceding discipline and belief. A slight hedge is the near-total competence in execution; struggle is more emotional than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motive—preserving Elara’s full, flawed self—drives every choice, with embodied details (the river stone, the meticulous video study) revealing his temperament. The refusal to “slash and burn” and the choice to integrate show credible values under pressure. Internal contradiction (love vs. the risk of reviving pain) is present but resolves smoothly; the struggle could show more friction. Still, his actions align with a clear hierarchy of values and pay a visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is precise and embodied—anger, pride, and tenderness act simultaneously in scene and drive micro‑choices (the slow approach, the steady breath, the refusal to rush). His renunciation of anger is earned through the meticulous care for the chameleon. Actions align tightly with motive and reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The change reads as an endurance/renunciation with felt cost, not a free epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s drive (to decode scars) is specific and embodied, and the new plant-telepathy complicates that desire in scene. His ritual with coffee rings, the tunneling, and the recoil when the ivy panics reveal contradictory impulses without tidy smoothing. The final renunciation—accepting the role of archivist rather than closer—feels earned and paid for. Minor note: a few explicit statements of motive edge toward telling, but they’re anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—she hunts where unused love is stored—and her methodical, tactile choices (unspool, touch, push deeper) align with it. Interiority is embodied and specific (“dust… tasted of rust and regret,” “breathless on her stool”). The main limitation is a lack of visible internal contradiction or cost beyond melancholy; the arc is contemplative rather than contested. Still, the endurance/renunciation at the end (“Her work was done”) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s need for quiet to free her creativity is concrete and consistent, and her embodied practice (stained fingers, diamond stylus, smoked glass) roots her interiority. The climax earns her change: she reframes the “static” as a cosmic plainsong and chooses to engage (sketching faces) rather than only escape. The contradiction—craving silence yet living amid human noise—resolves credibly through a revaluation rather than an easy fix. The epiphany is swift but motivated by the extraordinary meteor and her established ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation (guarding and cultivating possibilities) drives a specific choice under pressure: neither erase the forest-memory nor surrender to it, but synthesize. Interiority is particular (hum of the skiff, “dreamless” state) and embodied via the violent pine-scent intrusion. The contradiction—professional detachment versus the stirrings of desire/dream—emerges credibly. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the restraint reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct interiority and motive—he seeks to decode his condition—are rendered through tactile habits (the thumbed gear) and sensory focus. The agency to follow the chimes to the quartz tree reveals character. Internal contradiction is light; doubt versus drive never collides on the page, making the epiphany feel minimally contested. Still, actions align with motives and the closing acceptance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—seeking courage after an “unmooring”—is clear and embodied in small, credible acts (waiting, following, then walking alone). Interiority remains specific and sensory rather than diagnostic, with the kelp ticket and its heartbeat‑pulse revealing her inner state. Internal conflict is quiet but present (trust versus fear), though it rarely reaches contradictory friction on the page. The final decision reads earned, with a felt cost in solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and layered: bodily healing versus moral reckoning. Contradictory impulses (leave/flee vs remain/face) act on the page and culminate in a costly, quiet choice. Interiority is embodied through the staircase stain, bolt, and nerve “accusation,” avoiding therapy‑speak. The final gesture with the bolt aligns cleanly with his values and flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation (restore balance, not vengeance) is clear and consistent, and his choices (retrieving the pellet, enacting the rune) align with that drive. Interiority is present in the weary, precise focus, though true internal contradiction is minimal. The embodied cost—his dissolution—registers and feels earned by the preceding labor. Character complexity could deepen with more in‑scene tension beyond serene competence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motive—grief for Lena and the reef—drives clear, specific choices, and his obsession is embodied in tactile habits (tapping, handling the atlas page). The despair-to-purpose turn reads earned through failure and revision. Internal contradiction (duty vs. obsession) is present but could sharpen under peak pressure for even greater complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting defeat into meaning—drives concrete choices (aligning etchings, humming), and her awkward confidence is embodied (nearly tripping yet persisting). Interiority remains specific to her tactile, sonic focus without therapy-speak. However, internal contradiction is light and the visible personal price of success is minimal, softening the arc’s felt cost. The care‑taking identity and maternal relic nuance her stance without generating live conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—countering engineered docility with a biologically grounded resilience—and her actions align tightly with that aim. Interiority is sensorially embodied (listening to plants as pressure/heat/mineral sensations). However, there’s little on‑page contradictory impulse or internal friction; she reads largely resolved rather than pressed into a fraught choice. The cost to her (personal, moral, relational) is implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is precise and embodied—the freeze, the ice blooming, the jaw knot, and the tactile refuge in soil and resin read character‑specific rather than generic. Contradictory impulses are active in scene: she must freeze and she must care for the pine. Her choice to endure and resume work is an earned renunciation with felt cost. No therapy‑speak; the “pearl of stillness” is behaviorally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (salt-laced dust, brittle spine like bone), with a clear, particular motive: to descend and reconfigure rather than flee. The pivotal decision “He would not mend the box; he would redesign it” credibly grows from his failures with faces and fragmentation. Contradictory impulses flicker (escape vs. descent; mend vs. redesign) without tidy over-explanation. The ending registers a real shift in self-conception with a felt cost (ache persists).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive—hunting the cause of time dilation—drives clear, consistent choices, culminating in his renunciation of communal duty to pursue the drone. The “serene anger” reads embodied through physical detail (chalk-pale skin, narrowed eyes) and cold focus. Internal contradiction (rage versus serenity; duty versus obsession) is present but underplayed, with little visible struggle in the decision moment. Competence borders on effortless, slightly lowering the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are vividly rendered: duty versus conscience, preservation versus provocation. Embodied stress (“vertigo,” trembling fingers) anchors her inner debate in action. Her micro‑choices—bypassing main stacks, choosing the relic terminal, pressing send—align with escalating resolve. The felt cost (betrayal of vows and risk to self) is credibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—knees on the sandbag, fingers hovering, the knife’s weight—showing her contradictory impulses (heritage vs. chosen peace) acting simultaneously. Motivation (“weave continuity through chaos”) is dramatized through micro‑choices with the plant and the blade. The renunciation reads earned, with a felt cost in “a coffin for a future she would not entertain.” Minor label risk in “senselessly perceptive” is offset by concrete application to the plant.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive (“to catch the echo”) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices (humming counter‑frequency, tapping the spike). The interiority lands via concrete sensation (pressure behind eyes, hollowness) rather than labels. However, conflict within him is minimal—his competence largely smooths the path, with few contradictory impulses dramatized. The final endurance reads earned but with limited visible cost beyond the brief sorrow‑antenna moment.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Celeste’s motives are clear and character‑particular: a precise, observant daughter leveraging logic to defend her father while accepting the cost of exposing an uncle. The solemn/playful register under pressure reads earned, not performative. Interiority is embodied via tactile anchors (the hum of the dome, the rosewood nib). The only slight shortfall is limited on‑page ambivalence about harming family—the cost is implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s guilt-driven motive is clear and propulsive, and his agency at the terminal—reframing circuitry as constellations—aligns with his established identity. Interiority is specific (the “low-frequency hum”), and the final renunciation of ongoing torment reads earned. The “letters in his own frantic script from another life” is a magical-realist leap that’s accepted but lightly sketched. Minor ambiguity about practical competence under stress is outweighed by consistent, embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her socially perceptive read of others credibly redirects her tactic from speech to image. Interiority is embodied (paint‑stained fingers, sand grit), with a gentle contradiction between whimsy and unease. However, pressure on her is light—she meets little resistance—so the cost and struggle feel modest. The final endurance/stance is earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s motive (“aberrant mercy”) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it. Interiority is specific (static-tasting air, ghost-ache) and embodied. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he faces little doubt beyond a generalized burden, which softens the crucible. The Retro functions more as pressure than as a character, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Julian’s motive—an encore that averts tragedy—is clear and consistently enacted through his tactical “echoes.” Elara reads as specific in posture and gesture, but her concrete predicament remains vague, softening the felt stakes that would deepen characterization. The final choice (not flipping the coin, walking out) aligns with the setup and reveals value hierarchy (agency over fatalism), but comes a touch tidy. More friction or a visible price for Julian (exhaustion, risk of fading) would heighten the earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “affectionate skeptic” stance is embodied through concrete micro‑choices: he bites back doubt, designs a bodily test, and risks a second, higher‑stakes attempt. Interiority is specific (sternum frost, tingling hands) and contradictory impulses run concurrently. The final acceptance—“It didn’t matter if it was a conduit or a placebo”—reads as an earned renunciation with a felt cost to his skepticism. Minor neatness at the end keeps it just shy of transcendent complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive “to become the voice of the unknown” is clear, embodied through her tools, habits, and the fossil anchor. Micro‑choices—entering the null‑space, using the fossil to focus, surrendering the analytical mind—track cleanly. Internal contradiction is modest (curiosity vs. surrender of control) but present. The final acceptance of participation feels earned though the visible personal cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen’s motive (defy a fatalistic prophecy) is clear and consistently embodied through his tactile, meticulous labor. The internal crucible—duty to flip the clock versus the compulsion to reframe fate—tightens credibly as the sand runs out. Emotional texture comes via object handling and categorizing by intent, though the struggle reads smooth and nearly frictionless at times. The final refusal feels earned, with the cost implied in abandoning his sanctioned role.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motivation (guilt and the search for “unused courage”) drives credible micro-choices: watching Kestrel via the pillbox, erasing the snow code, choosing to go. Contradictory impulses—caution vs. compulsion to atone—operate simultaneously without tidy smoothing. Emotional texture is specific (engraving, Vienna memory) rather than generic. The endurance/renunciation at the end feels earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied, with a credible contradiction between guilt over Anya and a craftsman’s duty of care. His micro-choices—handling the yarn needle, listening rather than prodding, ultimately choosing to move forward—align with motives built in scene. The renunciation of “coming back” carries felt cost and results in an earned, character-specific stance. No therapy-speak or shortcut epiphany; the shift is grounded in sensory attention and long habit.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motive—understanding why places resist change—clearly drives his choices, and his potter’s sensibility colors perception and action. Interiority is concrete (clay, wheel memory), with embodied responses to the thrum and the rose. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he encounters little resistance beyond fatigue and focus, so we miss a sharper crucible. The endurance/change at the end feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—“to reflect light into dark corners”—is concrete, character‑particular, and enacted through precise micro‑choices (choosing the bitting gauge tooth, the fishing line, the nightly cadence). Her “protected vulnerability” manifests as a refusal to knock paired with sustained, costly outreach. Backstory (her locksmith father) is economical and directly charges the present tactic. The internal tension (reach out vs. remain sheltered) is subtle but active and earns the quiet endurance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motive—transforming isolation into independence—is crisply established and drives his choice to enter the library’s heart. Interiority is embodied (salt wind, coarse fur, the floor’s vibration) and the panic beat reads credible before the hum steadies him. The final acceptance feels earned, though a few thesis-like lines (“He was not a relic; he was a reservoir.”) flatten nuance. Still, actions align with motive, and the renunciation of “conquering” in favor of “coexisting” is a meaningful, character-driven shift.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the twig spiral as last link vs. risking connection—are dramatized in scene and resolved through action. Her profession as a ghostwriter meaningfully informs her ache and hesitation. The choice to let go carries a credible emotional cost scaled to the length. The arc is tidy but earned through concrete images rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation to counter the tricksters is clear and consistent, with embodied tension (“ozone and dust,” “bakelite cool”) and a credible dread/hope contradiction that propels choice. Her competence is balanced by fatigue and risk-awareness, preventing a fantasy of effortless mastery. Internal pressure culminates in a concrete micro‑choice at the console. The cost is modest but felt in the exhaustion and the acceptance of an ongoing fight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s fear/drive tension is embodied from the opening hitch of breath through the urge to scream vs. recalling the Architect’s notes. His prudence informs tactics (bringing only the compass point, measured risk), and claustrophobia degrades perception under stress. The peak choice—channeling the hum through the compass at the keystone—reads as a character-specific solution rooted in legacy and fear management. The cost is primarily psychological and narrowly averted, but it is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motive—awakening empathy rather than seeking justice—is specific, credible, and governs every micro‑choice from the ritualistic setup to the final incision. His prosopagnosia meaningfully constrains perception and tactics instead of being a label. The selfish aim versus the solemn site creates a live contradiction that resolves into a costly ache rather than a tidy cure. A minor tell (“wasn’t here for justice”) skews expository, but the embodied process earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, compelling motive (redeem Eva) drives concrete choices, and “nervously confident” reads on the body (thumb on nail, trembling, cliff‑edge feeling). Contradictory impulses—fear vs. idealism—coexist in scene and earn the final stance shift. Micro‑choices (programming the drone, pressing the nail) align with character. The only shortfall is limited on‑page cost or error under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied, with a credible shift from wary skepticism to charged belief. His micro-choices (unfurling the fist, reading the mesh, deciding to play) align with his history of “never” and his musician’s lens. The cost is mostly conceptual—foreclosing the comfort of resignation—so it reads strong but not punishingly high. Contradictory impulses (loneliness vs. hope; metaphor vs. literal code) are present without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives (resisting his father’s violent legacy and protecting his sanctuary) are clear and consistent, and his calm, observational tactics reveal character under pressure. The quiet exchange with the CEO crystallizes his stance without speechifying. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized, so the contradictory impulses don’t fully combust on the page. Still, the final renunciation—choosing endurance over confrontation—reads earned and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s motive and vocation braid cleanly into his behavior (aligning the refractor, surrendering to the dream, writing the translation). Interiority is rich and embodied (“cold copper,” tremble, breath) with a credible weariness-to-calm progression. Internal contradiction appears but stays gentle—he wants a solution but accepts lament—more friction in-scene could heighten it. The final renunciation/repricing reads earned and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her guarded temperament meets credible pressure that forces a costly change. The interiority is specific (“a fortress…walls were high”) and paid off when those walls crack to unbend the branch. Micro-choices (ignoring memory ghosts; choosing to push deeper; planting the seed) reveal her values under strain. A slight tendency toward mythic diction doesn't sandbag the credibility of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to re-knit the frayed world is embodied in tactile choices (tracing scars, gripping the clipping) under palpable contradictory impulses (anxious dread vs. elation). Her rooted constraint shapes tactic and temperament, avoiding abstraction. The decision to heed Kael and to impose order via the clipping reads earned by prior traits. The cost (enduring immobility, risk of psychic oblivion) remains present at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s motivation (to repair the wound he caused) is clear and compels a costly, specific choice under pressure. Contradictory impulses—panic versus “fiercely gentle” restraint; violence versus filling—are dramatized, not summarized. The reweighting of the burned Sun card into a “guard stone” earns a credible, costly stance shift. Slight idealization of his virtue limits the messiness of flaw, but not enough to blunt force.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied, with the quarry’s silence, the ringing ears, and the tactile struggle against the snag carrying his conflict. His motives—detachment via facts versus the need to feel and find purpose—are credible and consistent. The micro‑choice to place the cloth on the desk rather than archive or discard it feels like an earned renunciation. Slightly limited on-page contradiction under peak pressure keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s grief-driven curiosity is specific and embodied (soil under nails, reading tablets to the seed), with a credible tension between mourning and inquiry. Her translator’s mindset motivates tactics and the final shift. The renunciation—“not to get him back, but to prove their shared work”—feels earned. A touch of declarative thesising trims some messier, contradictory impulse texture.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelan’s purpose and contradictory impulses (Archivist vs. Smelter) are crisply embodied and motivate each action. The empathetic “searing pain” during smelting registers as cost, not just function. However, the ritual certainty dampens jeopardy, so inner conflict rarely threatens refusal or failure. The piece privileges poise over struggle, limiting depth of micro‑choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound inspector vs. yearning to reconnect—are embodied and collide at the hesitation beat before crowning the crystal. His tactile reactions (the pearl’s warmth spreading “like a transfusion of pure yearning”) personalize motive beyond abstract ideals. The final choice is earned by prior setup and carries a felt cost (oath-breaking, potential sabotage of the bunker’s purpose). No safety-hedging or tidy rationalization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (“world felt like sandpaper,” the taped bellows as a “broken lung”), his goal clear, and his final renunciation (leaving the accordion) carries a felt cost. The contradictory impulses—drive to map grief vs. dawning recognition of agency—play concurrently in scene. Emotional progression feels earned, if occasionally close to thematic shorthand. Overall, a credible, motivated change without tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive is urgent and specific—stop a lie by harvesting unspoken truths—and her tactics (repositioning, triangulating, documenting) align with that drive. Interiority is textured (cautious exuberance, tremor in fingers) without therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is present but light; she’s largely competent and forward‑driven with little hesitation or moral friction. The earned endurance at the end (turning to face the messenger with the library dissolving) lands with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior conflict—prestige versus fidelity to a living world—registers through embodied perceptions (cold marble, vine’s shock) and credible micro‑choices. The turn from contemplating the violin to cutting the vine is motivated by cumulative evidence (plant memory, coffee prophecy). The ache, framed as “mulberry,” carries across beats and informs action. The decision arrives a touch swiftly, but it’s earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is crystal clear and consistent: she exists to preserve a last spark. Interiority is vivid but largely one-note—calm competence with minimal contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The micro‑choices (selecting the memory, channeling it) align with her role but never test her limits. The endurance cost is more conceptual than personal, keeping the arc strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior conflict—trained non‑interference versus chosen participation—plays in real time and motivates the decisive act. Embodied details (cool bark, damp earth, hairpin weight) keep emotions specific rather than labeled. The forgiveness backstory credibly reorients her values and informs the present choice. Cost is subtle (breaking tradition/risk to the Heart-Bloom) but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Two sharply etched figures under pressure: the “conscience for hire” with a calibrated, performative ethic, and Kaelen with tremor and waning bravado. Motivation and stakes are clean, and the decisive renunciation (unhooking the cloak) feels earned by the prior beats. Some theme-forward lines risk slight didacticism, but actions and micro-choices align with motives. The embodied costs (shiver, lost mantle, paid fee) ground the change.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s impatience and grief-driven goal (finding his sister) conflict with the demanded renunciation, giving him a credible internal contradiction. Elara’s reverse-aging and principled withholding sharpen their dynamic without didactic overreach. The epiphany is earned through on-page ritual rather than declared. Slight neatness at the end keeps the cost mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelan’s motivation and ethos—reverence, patience, and the ambition to “navigate without moving”—are clear and drive choices. Micro-choices (waiting rather than disturbing, using the flock, guiding rather than silencing) reveal character. However, internal contradiction is light; the piece leans on competence with minimal friction or competing impulses. The final renunciation/guidance feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and embodied (cold, altitude, the “knot of inadequacy”) and his choices under pressure (abandoning tools, touching the stone) flow from character. The underachiever/archaic practitioner contradiction is dramatized rather than told. The renunciation feels earned and forecloses a path (his institutionally sanctioned methods). Minor neatness in the confidence turn keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motive is clear and particular—he masks a pilgrimage as routine work—and his internal contradiction (“This wasn’t about grief; it was about physics”) feels human rather than declared. Embodied detail (the brass tag, rebreather checks, switching off the torch) grounds emotion. The peak choice to embrace darkness and listen instead of search by sight feels character‑specific and earned. Minor ding: peril and resistance are largely internal, with little friction beyond his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—“to wavelength align with purpose”—is distinct and drives concrete choices (risking the sensors, casting lots). His internal conflict between prophet and madman is dramatized at the moment of full-power commitment and again when he nearly aborts. The coin ritual and fear of isolation reveal character-specific behavior under pressure. The ending’s renunciation of his prior aim reads earned and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—Kael’s grief is embodied through objects (atlas page, prism, audio player) and micro‑choices (pressing play, angling the lens, naming the crystal). Motivation is clear and intensifies toward a focused act. The contradiction—an immortal ferryman seeking a shape for pain he cannot heal—feels earned rather than stated. A slight limit: internal conflict escalates texturally more than through distinct decision nodes.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and character‑particular, with “lukewarm” ability and brittle devotion creating credible tension between futility and faith. Micro‑choices under pressure (adjusting drip intervals, noticing silence between sounds) reveal his values. Emotions are embodied (exhaustion, brittle resolve) rather than labeled. The endurance choice carries an on‑page cost (utterly spent) and earns the quiet turn.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives progress cleanly from duty to obsession to a principled, “precisely humane” correction; the ledger scene makes his values legible. Internal tension—family myth versus communal truth—registers, though he encounters little active resistance and his hands “did not shake,” softening struggle. Concrete reactions to objects (label, tin box, photos) reveal character without therapy‑speak. The final act forecloses the easier path of silence and preserves cost in social memory.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is crystalline and sustained: he seeks to fuse logic and intuition and is trapped by his own intellect. Contradictory impulses are dramatized—he begins by calculating the murmuration and then chooses to “let go.” Micro-choices (abandoning alembics, following the flock, warming rather than melting the crystal) reveal values under pressure. The change feels earned; the only softness is that the emotional cost of renouncing the cage of logic is more implied than taxed.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—preserving trust under pressure—threads every choice, from suppressing a system-wide alert to risking the fragile crystal dial. Interiority is embodied (tremor, the buckle in his palm) and specific rather than labeled. The muscle-memory beat reveals a credible contradiction (fear-steadying through past trauma) that earns the final act. Complexity is slightly narrow—mostly duty versus fear—but fully coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s motivation (piercing numbness through creation) is clear and drives credible micro-choices under pressure. His internal contradiction—feeding a nascent mind with both remembered love and present void—acts in scene, not summary. Jin’s fear adds relational pressure and clarifies stakes without flattening him into a caricature. The final acceptance of responsibility reads as an earned shift with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s curiosity-over-fear and maker’s temperament read specific and consistent, and his choice to plant rather than investigate sender identity feels earned by “Patience is the lock and the key.” Internal contradiction is mild—he shifts quickly from inquiry to ritual without much resistance or cost on the page. Still, micro‑choices (soil mix, sunless shelf) externalize his values under pressure. The acceptance of a years‑long, possibly grotesque bloom hints at cost but remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is precise and propulsive: he wants to restore laughter and can only act through noise. The internal contradiction (“mournfully eager”) is dramatized in the failed pulls and the ferocity of the sound. Micro‑choices (garage → hallway; second pull → third) reveal a hierarchy of values under constraint. The closing sliver of peace reads earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional rather than explicitly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyel’s contradictory impulses—guardianship versus homesick yearning—are dramatized in scene and culminate in a costly refusal. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“interiorizing exteriors,” ice in his veins) rather than label‑speak. His final act—pouring longing and uncertainty into the pendant—aligns with established traits and reveals hierarchy of values. Minor abstraction at times (“make friends with uncertainty”) slightly softens the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s drive to escape mediocrity is concrete, and his stoic exterior versus flinching sensitivity plays authentically under pressure. Micro‑choices—chipping fragments, cataloging failures, finally choosing to listen—arise from that tension. The epiphany (“He wasn’t a shepherd…”) is earned by prior missteps. A slight tendency toward abstract framing (“creative destruction”) doesn’t undercut the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and character‑specific, and her sequence of micro‑choices (repositioning the fragment, inverting gain) aligns with that motive. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are light; despair is noted but quickly supplanted by smooth competence. The mentor’s maxim risks tidy epiphany rather than pressure‑forged change. The ending registers a credible stance shift, but without a sharp personal trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Finn’s resilient pragmatism reads cleanly in micro-choices (heading to the bridge, retooling the radio) and aligns with his deckhand competence. The “sudden, terrifying clarity” skirts an unearned leap, compressing struggle into intuition rather than showing a contested deduction. Emotional embodiment—hum as bone-deep, silence “louder than noise”—keeps him specific. Cost lands as solitary awareness when others reset to normal without memory.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied in action—he must “discover the texture of connection,” and every choice (accepting the altered memory, tying the final knot) serves it. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific, with tactile sensory anchors (ozone, salt, marble skin). The internal contradiction is present but subtle: a calm, methodical pursuit that courts danger and hollowness. A sharper on‑page tug-of-war or hesitation at the final step could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and particular: a navigator compelled to reconceive “void as landscape” after first contact. Interiority is concrete (the anchor’s shifting meaning; “somber marvel” braided with professional duty) though internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressure‑cooking. His secret nights of work and risk of defying Valerius give credible stakes. The final stance—asking the city to become “the first link in a new chain”—is earned if not harrowingly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive and method are vivid and consistent, and Leo’s embodied distress lands cleanly. However, Elias faces little internal contradiction or cost; his competency glides to success without a meaningful self-risk or compromise. The relationship beat works, but pressure on Elias’s limits is light. The result is affecting but not transformative for character.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, compelling interiority: duty to “the unremembered” is in live tension with visceral claustrophobia. The panic at the collapsed corridor and refusal to squeeze through dramatize contradiction, leading to a creative pivot. Micro‑choices (pinching the gold fleck, whispering equations) reveal values under pressure. Slight safety in the outcome (no messy moral residue) keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—salvaging wisdom from Aris’s failure—drives concrete, tactile choices (ink work, heartbeat as metronome). Her “clerical ghost” status particularizes interiority without therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is subtle (erasure vs. agency), not dramatized as a live clash, which limits depth under peak pressure. The closing repricing feels earned but pays a light cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific motivation (preserve the Old Tongue by translating texture into sound) drives concrete choices, and embodied detail (“copper‑veined hands…trembled”) grounds emotion. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (faith in matter vs elders’ belief in breath; confidence vs tremor). The peak choice—aligning the diamond at the precise moment—feels earned by prior obsession. Cost is more conceptual than personal, slightly softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Julian’s interior conflict—wanting a villain vs. recognizing a gentler, alien mercy—lands in concrete micro‑choices (watching, stepping forward, lifting the phone/arrowhead, then setting them down). His motive evolves credibly from exposé to stewardship with visible cost (relinquishing the sister he imagined). Emotions are embodied through specific, garden‑coloured perception, not labels. Minor safety lies in how quickly his bitterness melts, but the witnessed metamorphosis earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (“reawaken beauty in a world that had chosen the certainty of gears”) is clear and consistent, and her choices under pressure—sneaking past Wardens, syncing pulse to bow—align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through the heartbeat method and nervous flutter, with fear and hope held simultaneously. However, contradiction is modest; she faces danger but the inner conflict remains relatively tidy. The visible cost lands as exhaustion rather than a deeper moral or relational price.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, particular motivation (healing broken promises via reunion) drives precise, risky action. Interiority is textured and embodied (“quiet ache,” dust as “second skin”), though internal contradiction under peak pressure is muted—competence dominates with little wobble or error. The “respectfully rebellious” stance is dramatized (threading seams, not breaking the system). The ending offers credible endurance rather than a revelatory shift, with a modest but felt cost in risk.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—translating silence into possibility—threads cleanly from his retreat to his restorative craft to the climactic choice to sing. Interiority is embodied through tactile work and object handling rather than labels. The conflict is quiet but credible: preservation of hush versus risking it to crown the mare. Slight limitation: contradictory impulses are implied more than dramatized in micro-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motivation and a meticulous temperament drive concrete micro-choices (book placement, scarf tension). Interiority is filtered through tactile action rather than summary. Internal contradiction is light—he’s resolute more than conflicted—so the felt cost is mostly the tremor and renunciation at the end. Still, his “sanely eccentric” habits credibly govern tactics and reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s obsession is clear, consistent, and embodied in specific ritualized choices (boat, plate, palette). Interiority is textured but not deeply contradictory; he experiences tension as patient hunger rather than clashing impulses. The earned shift from hollowed longing to quiet contentment reads credible. Cost is mostly pre-paid (years of emptiness) rather than newly exacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystalline (freeing an idea from fear), and the Locksmith’s actions align cleanly with it. Interiority is mostly externalized through ritual and image rather than contradictory impulses; he meets little resistance beyond the lock’s design. The mother’s grief is present and embodied but lightly used as a crucible. Change is earned, though the Locksmith’s near-frictionless competence softens character drama.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation (recovering stolen childhood memories) is specific and compels the decisive breach of his non‑interference rule. Interiority is textured and embodied (pressure gauge, breath fogging glass), with a credible internal contradiction between discipline and hunger. The final act forecloses a path—observer only—with a felt cost. Minor note: his flaw-curiosity could show one more concrete past cost to deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s “combative tenderness” and backward shuffling under pressure make him vivid, and Elara’s shift from smallness to deliberate rebuilding reads earned. Micro-choices (not looking at the mess; choosing to restack) reveal values under stress. The mentor–student status dynamic evolves credibly, with belief and fear braided. No safety-hedging; the final endurance choice forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elian’s motive and competence are clear, and the micro‑choice to infuse the seed rather than simply plant it aligns with his “insatiably creative” trait. However, there’s little internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure; he never wavers or pays a visible personal price. Interiority is largely lyrical purpose rather than character‑particular friction. Strong embodiment, but the arc reads as assured execution rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is precise and embodied—she restores spirits as she restores masks—while the apprentice’s fear and dawning resolve give the relationship texture. Interiority is specific (breath‑holding, bone‑cool needle), and actions align with vocation under pressure. Internal contradiction is modest (weariness vs. duty), not profound, keeping the emotional profile strong but not searing. The closing handoff credibly shifts burden with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—clearly drives her choices, culminating in restraint rather than intrusion. Interiority is concrete and profession-specific (dehumidifiers, vellum, lichen, projectors), giving her a distinct sensibility. The internal tension between curiosity and preservation is present but remains subtle rather than sharply dramatized. The final annotation “threshold found” reads as an earned, values-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, coherent motivation and a calm, precise interiority; the choice to leave the globe earns a credible endurance/renunciation. Internal conflict is present but tidy; the analytic reconciliation arrives a bit cleanly. “Mortimer” is an intriguing, under‑explained facet that hints at contradiction without fully pressuring a choice. Emotions are contained yet embodied through methodical action.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s motive—giving shape to Lyra’s loneliness—is clear and drives every action under a believable time constraint. Interiority is specific (the tactile bolt plate, the bodily calm under pressure), and his momentary fear of failure adds human grain. The internal contradiction is modest (tranquil poise versus urgency) and could cut deeper. The closing cost—this communion is fleeting—reads as an earned endurance rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motive—seeking the joy beneath Elara’s grief—drives specific actions (putting on the goggles, unfolding the vellum) and is shaded by guilt and loyalty. Interiority is concrete (“breath caught,” trembling) and the intrusion vs. duty tension reads. The ending choice to keep the secret reframes his service with a felt, if quiet, cost. Slight tidiness and low external resistance keep it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—memorialize Lena by proving “empty spaces remember”—and actions align through the emotional taxonomy of clouds. Interiority is specific and embodied (“fear was a low-altitude emotion”), avoiding stock grief. The main limitation is minimal internal contradiction; he moves with serenity rather than struggle. The ending’s renunciation (not writing it down, accepting drift) reads earned, if softly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and perceptual limitations are specific and drive her tactics under pressure, particularly the tactile decoding of the coin and the choice to remain and complete the task as demolition nears. Interiority is embodied (dust, grain, tremors) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction—her “limitation” as strength—adds texture, though the emotional cost to her personally could be sharpened beyond sanctuary loss. The final choice reads as an earned endurance/renunciation more than a dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s motive is clean and character‑specific—curious, methodical, and lonely without self‑pity—and his micro‑choices (reading scuffs, cross‑referencing the phrasebook, returning to the deck) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and embodied (oil, vellum, wind), avoiding stock feeling labels. However, internal contradiction is light; frustration resolves quickly into competence without a counter‑impulse meaningfully opposing the discovery push. The ending reframes his role credibly but with minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—her “rhythm of repair” hums under every choice—and her competence feels earned through tools and lineage. Internal pressure surfaces in the mirrors’ “fractured echoes,” but contradictory impulses are light; she moves almost unerringly once the solution is clear. The nervous, tactile search for the scalloped gear is a strong character-revealing beat. A touch more visible cost or hesitation at the peak would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motives (survival/escape) and a credible relational dynamic (Elara’s fragile faith vs. Kaelen’s cynicism) give the group texture under pressure. Interiority is selective and serviceable but not deep; Elara’s inner conflict is implied rather than dramatized. Anya’s bravery reads, though she’s more function than psyche. The ghost’s motive is clear but mostly told, limiting character‑level complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied through tactile objects (the puppet, the pane), and his “not a herald of doom but a purveyor of its quietest grace” frames a credible, specific worldview. The internal contradiction—impossible arrogance vs. bruised awe—adds needed tension without speechifying. Micro‑choices (placing the puppet, choosing the lullaby, committing his essence) align with motive under pressure. A hint more live resistance or doubt at the peak could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motivation (save the traveler) plays against his weariness and resentment of the role, producing credible, embodied choices. The reluctance versus endurance tension is present but understated; we glimpse it in “the solution he hated performing” and his weary, precise labor. Micro‑choices (when to begin, how to angle and activate, disassembly after) align with his values. A deeper on‑page contradiction at the peak could intensify the inner crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motive—to atone and understand his rupture with Lena—is specific and drives every perception. His chemist’s lens personalizes interiority and reveals credible contradiction (control vs. awe), culminating in the concrete micro‑choice to touch the chrysalis and commit to writing. The change feels earned, with cost preserved as grief that “does not vanish” but loosens. Slight tidiness in the epiphany trims edge, but not credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motive—to locate the origin of stories—drives every choice, culminating in the risky decision to scar the perfect tree. Interiority is particular (measuring silences, mapping voids) and reveals a character whose calm houses obsession. The cost is conceptual but legible: he wounds perfection to begin. Slightly light on contradictory impulse under pressure; the act is steady rather than contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to soften the cutting edges of memory—is clear, embodied, and drives every choice, culminating in the costly decision to subsume the pavilion’s grief. The Warlord interaction briefly externalizes status and history without derailing the single‑POV focus. Interiority is sensorially specific (taste as memory) rather than diagnostic. The final change (touch without pain) feels earned, though the totality of relief borders on tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular (“construct bridges from silos”) and his trait—empathetic decisiveness—shows in the critical dial nudge. Interiority is present but largely assured; we get little contradictory impulse or doubt in the peak beat. Embodied emotion lands (sweat, steadiness, careful handling of the weight). The cost to him is modest, limiting depth of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—becoming “the archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is clear and drives every choice. Interiority is vivid and embodied (gel scent, throbbing head, “storm of ghosts”). The internal conflict between preservation and self‑dissolution is present, though she skews highly competent with limited moral or relational friction. The closing acceptance of the composer’s dream reads earned by the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive is clear and consistent—prevent an “intellectual plague” by retrieving a perilous synthesis—and his panic-then-discipline under pressure reads embodied. We glimpse contradiction (cold panic vs. trained prism-mind) but his inner conflict remains modest and largely competence-forward. Micro-choices (aligning the doodle with fungi, choosing to bolt as gravity rights) reveal priorities. The closing burden (“internal fire”) lands, though moral complexity could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s drive is clean and particular—making music in a world she can’t hear—and her actions (choosing the Old One, reading stress cracks, using the insulator) align tightly with that motive. Interiority is embodied through tactile, craft-specific perception rather than labels. The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses in the moment, reading more as resolute competence than contested desire. Still, the renunciation of “imposing” a melody in favor of releasing what’s there registers as a meaningful, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (seeking beauty via pattern) and embodied interiority (the ache of fillings, the dented stone) read strong. However, internal contradiction is mild; he rarely strains against himself or risks error. Competence dominates with little depicted struggle before the payoff. The final renunciation (dropping the stone) lands as a credible, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular motivation (cataloging silences for empathy) with embodied interiority (synesthetic tasting of tones). The choice not to read the diary and to “recover the feeling” aligns with his values and reveals him under pressure. Internal contradiction is mild—time pressure versus reverence—so the struggle feels gentle rather than fraught. Still, micro-choices (overshooting the dial by feel) credibly earn the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—grow the corpse flower by cultivating serenity within motion—and her hyper‑sensitivity both enables and endangers that goal. The peak beat (“Pain bloomed behind her eyes...”) shows contradictory impulses (flight vs. focus) acting simultaneously. Her micro‑choice to close her eyes and anchor to the seed’s scent reads earned, with a felt cost. The post‑storm drawing refines the change without over‑tidying.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s need to save the blighted orchard is clear, and her choices consistently align with that motive. Her embodied responses (the hum in her bones, the controlled silence) give her an interior texture. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she reads chiefly as competent and steady under pressure, with little friction beyond time. The final stance feels earned but lightly priced emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s drive—to understand and anticipate catastrophe—remains clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (sensor placement, recalibration, pivot to the sky) align with that motive. The interiority is concrete (haze on teeth, weight of knowledge) but the internal contradiction stays mostly latent until the hollow victory at the end. The final renunciation is credible—knowledge at the cost of solace—yet we get limited in‑scene struggle beyond competence under pressure. Strong, if more stoic than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and particular—“to certify wonder as essential”—and his embodied calm against the cold reads as character-specific. His agency drives the action from cue to performance. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he never wavers or pays a visible emotional price. The ending’s serenity lands, but without a felt personal cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, embodied interiority anchors every move: grief and purpose manifest in tactile choices (driftwood, the flute, playing a question). Contradictory impulses—keeper vs dissector, barrier vs weave—operate simultaneously on the page. The final renunciation (needle not hammer) feels earned and costly. Slight risk of neatness in the self-articulation tempers the top end.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s cold, data‑driven motive and Anya’s raw need for relief are cleanly opposed and consistent in action. Interiority is more suggested than inhabited; Anya’s internal conflict is glimpsed (“feeling exposed,” “dizzying shock”) rather than layered. Elias’s borrowing of Anya’s cadence shows character under pressure without over‑explaining. The final reconfiguration lands for Anya, though the emotional cost is conceptual more than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s fear, bodily tremor, and desire for a “simple routine” render his interior pressure concrete, and his steadied hands at the end feel earned by the witnessed phenomenon. The absent mentor’s maxim provides a through‑line that motivates his route choice and frames the shift. The transformation is a touch tidy—his anxiety resolves quickly—but it’s grounded in a specific, sensory experience rather than declared out of nowhere. Lack of an on‑page human foil limits relational crucible, but the pendant and ridge serve that function adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, embodied motive (prove objects absorb emotions to keep her “sacred”) drives specific actions and risks. Interiority is particular—mystic-methodical—and the contradiction between poet and scientist is dramatized rather than told. The closing renunciation of the poetic reading is earned and costs him the comfort of his sustaining lie. Small note: grief’s messiness is mostly channeled into method, leaving little in-scene irrational leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive—send a message at the price of her own memories—is precise, consistent, and escalates to a final renunciation. The falter “last night” versus the recommencement “this morning” shows real internal conflict resolved by action. Embodied details (the scent of his hair, the cadence of his laugh) turn memory into currency, revealing character under pressure. The ending’s earned stasis—choosing peace in emptied longing—feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (“to coax resilience from rubble”) drives credible, costly choices. His fear sits beside resolve, and the barter of cherished sensory memories embodies a lived contradiction. Interiority is concrete (plums, breeze), not label‑speak. The quiet decision to descend again tomorrow reads as earned endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and specific—Kael seeks the withheld truth about Elara—and his decisive act to redirect the cascade aligns with established traits. Interiority is textured (sensory mapping as worldview) and emotions are embodied through perception rather than labels. The final renunciation (closing the nexus, losing the echoes) reads as a credible cost. A deeper on‑page tug‑of‑war (temptation to hold the window to Elara vs. duty) could have added extra charge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s motive—protect the light to preserve a hard-won sense of safety—drives every choice and coheres with his reticence and ritualized stone‑language. Interiority is specific and embodied (oilskins, the sea glass’s cold weight), with a credible conflict between competence and helplessness toward the keeper’s fate. The farewell circle signals an earned renunciation with visible emotional cost. A hairline nit: the “singular command: protect” edges toward abstraction compared to the otherwise concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—he’s the Laughing Storm Herald shaping dawn—but internal contradiction is light until the final repricing. Embodied emotion (manic laughter, trembling exhaustion) lands, yet we get little friction between joy and doubt during the peak. Micro‑choices on the levers register but aren’t morally fraught. The end’s “the dawn was beginning to shape him” earns a modest change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen’s curiosity post-transplant is clear, embodied in tactile choices (loupe, chalking sun trails) and culminates in the decision to approach the woman with the wing. Interiority is particular to a dye master’s sensibility; the donor heart adds a credible tug without drifting into diagnosis-speak. Internal tension (caution vs. compulsion to witness) is present but soft; the felt cost of the final stance is more conceptual than visceral. Secondary character pressure is quiet yet effective in the brief exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motive—curating grief to learn what trees witness—is clear and drives all actions. Interiority is specific (dust motes as colleagues; “quantified sorrow”) and embodied through tools and process. However, there’s little on-page contradiction or pressure testing his values, so transformation reads as a deepened stance rather than a contested choice. The final micro‑shift (acceptance/archival) is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is crystalline and embodied—she must recall a song to revive the Lumina tree and realm. Interiority is vivid and specific (memory as shards; notes feeling like “the color yellow”), and her caretaking micro‑choices coax lyrics. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she is singularly purposed with little competing impulse, so cost reads gentle rather than knife‑edge. The closing sense of relief and regained wholeness feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictions (compassionate yet reclusive, craving connection yet fearing overwhelm) are embodied in concrete micro‑choices: the decision to “hide” via attention, to watch Elara, and to leave the invitation unfolded. Interiority is specific and sensorial (beeswax, vellum, hum of knowledge), not label‑only. The final reconfiguration—connection through shelter rather than braving storms—feels earned by prior beats. The only softness is the relatively low visible cost on the page, though the renunciation reads credible for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motive—salvaging the sacred in erasure—is embodied in tactile choices: keeping the bread, planting herbs, and risking engagement with authority. Contradictory impulses (her “private sin” of hoarding vs. public planting) coexist credibly and drive the climactic offering of the heel. The patrolman’s brief arc reads human and specific, with status softening in subtext. The final endurance—continuing her quiet defiance after only being “seen”—feels earned and costly at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and consistent—salvage essence, not stop the end—and his micro‑choices (tuning, whispering “Hold,” stabbing the rune) align under pressure. Interiority is restrained but embodied (breath fog, careful handling) and competence feels earned. Internal contradiction is minimal; he endures rather than wrestles, keeping the arc subtle. The earned stasis at the end reads credible, if emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to capture “the sound of trust breaking” and protect her community) is clear and drives concrete, escalating choices. Her stubborn ingenuity culminates in a morally gray lie that aligns with her curiously steadfast trait. Interiority is specific and embodied (brine, mildew, recorder weight), with micro‑choices under pressure. Internal contradiction (valuing truth yet weaponizing a lie) adds credible complexity without grandstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive (“a relentless need for proof”) is clear and embodied through her taste‑based method and the compass ring as a control. The skeptic/wonder contradiction plays on the page as she registers the carriers and the aurora’s response. However, she mostly witnesses rather than chooses under pressure, so the change is a reconfiguration of stance rather than a costly decision. The cost is conceptual (humility, reframed aim) rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent: shame over past impatience and the need to reclaim authentic artistry. Interiority is embodied (charcoal under nails, the tear) and his competence is balanced by a prior flaw. The final renunciation—shifting from coin‑driven replication to riskier truth—feels earned. Slight neatness in the epiphany line trims some ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s yearning for sincerity and his craftsman’s patience motivate consistent, goal-driven choices (assembling the map, following it, planting the seed). Interiority is textured through objects (fern, tools) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are light; the path from discovery to resolve is smooth. The identity shift (“not just a calligrapher... a cultivator”) lands but with limited felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motive—to preserve wonder—drives every action, and his embodied attention (hands on ice, listening to pressure changes) reads specific and credible. However, internal conflict is minimal; he encounters little friction beyond patience and precision. The muteness frames his focus but doesn’t force a difficult trade‑off. The final renunciation is external (the sculpture’s loss) rather than an internal crucible that tests contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cohesive, character‑particular interiority—a caretaker unit haunted by Elara—drives concrete choices under pressure. The machine/organic contradiction is dramatized (static vs. remembered laughter; “I am no longer a gardener; I am a crucible”). Micro‑decisions escalate credibly: retrieving the coffer despite warden AIs, opening it, pushing harder through overload, then choosing to leave the garden. The resolution is a clear earned change with a felt cost, though the post‑compression calm verges on tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to mend community through listening—guides every choice and is consistently embodied in his calm tactics. Interiority is present and specific (curator’s eye, tactile attention to the locket), though he reads almost saintly with little contradiction or flaw. Secondary characters apply gentle, relevant pressure through their memories. The final act (using the locket) aligns cleanly with his established trait set.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—liberating her mother by surrendering control—is clear, particular, and earned through the dance insight and the dice choice. Interiority is embodied (movement-as-thinking) and avoids generic labels. The final act costs her a core trait (control), which reads as a credible renunciation. A minor limit: internal contradiction could be sharpened under greater moment-to-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s drive is precise and embodied—the lantern keeper whose secret work is rescuing erased memories. His tenderness toward Elara’s pressed flowers and physical response to the gravity pocket render his interior stakes concrete. The conflict is mostly single‑valence (yearning vs. impediment) with limited on‑page contradiction, but the grief/hope tension under pressure feels credible. Actions align tightly with motive and culminate in a paid‑for endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clean and particular—she aims to hush, not unmake, the prophecy—and her actions align with that ethos. Interiority is steady and embodied (the brook baseline; the “cool and heavy like river stone” energy), but there’s little contradictory impulse or visible doubt to pressure her. Competence dominates; we don’t feel a genuine risk of failure or moral cost. The endurance at the end feels earned but low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s desire to “become fluent” in a building’s language is specific, embodied through touch and listening, and drives her choice to confront Elias. The internal tension—comfort in the “agreed upon lies” versus the need for truth—surfaces credibly in the rooftop invitation and question. Elias’s tutelage and gift meaningfully shape her evolution without overexplaining her motives. The final acceptance of custodianship carries a felt cost: relinquishing their sanctuary of denial.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motive—reclaiming a quarantined memory to transform isolation into independence—is clear and intensifies under pressure. The skeptic/longing contradiction is dramatized in micro-choices (urge to sever vs. pushing harder). Embodied emotion (dizziness, bone‑deep resonance) grounds the interiority. One slightly declarative line (“independence wasn’t safety; it was ownership”) edges toward thesis but is earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motive—“a forgery of compassion” to release ancestors from an unwinnable vendetta—is clear, specific, and governs every micro‑choice. Embodied pressure (cold sting in lungs, trembling after) grounds the interiority. The treason/loyalty tension plays as a credible contradiction, though the resistance he faces is internal rather than contested on the page. The final calm feels earned by the precision and risk taken.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and embodied—duty braided with personal grief, anchored by her mother’s silence. Her micro-choices (moving deeper, tuning her pitch, choosing answer over question) align with traits and escalate believably. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (sorrow vs. service), so peak pressure never forces a jagged, risky trade. Still, the final renunciation of asking in favor of finishing feels earned and specific to her.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive—to salvage something pure—is clear and consistent, and her choices (deepening the trance, constructing the shared dream) align with it. Interiority is specific to her vocation, though she faces little internal contradiction or meaningful doubt. The man is a functional foil rather than a complex character, and the boy is emblematic. The resolution feels earned but emotionally low‑cost for Elara, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motives (honoring hidden effort and yearning to “feel the weave”) are specific and embodied in small, telling actions. His demure audacity vs. humility plays out in the whistle beat and the quiet acceptance afterward. Emotional texture is concrete (tea whisk, calloused fingers, moon paths) and reactions align with values. The change is modest but earned: he reframes participation as appreciative craft, with a felt cost of renouncing grander intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen’s motivation as a professional debunker is clear and drives each action (letters, lens, climb). Interiority is competent but cool; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a felt cost to unseating the myth beyond principle. Competence dominates, leaving little genuine struggle or degradation under pressure. Still, reactions to objects (diamond flaw, antenna vantage) reveal a specific, methodical mind.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motive—“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is clear and governs choices from tuning the ether to rejecting the two masters. Interiority is vivid and embodied (panic, trembling as he unfolds the map). Contradictory pulls (order vs anarchy; allegiance vs autonomy) operate in scene. The cost of his final renunciation is implied more than felt, slightly softening the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and coherent—he aims to translate the lost to the found—and every action aligns with that drive. Interiority is sensorially embedded and character‑particular (jars, tide, grass), revealing tenderness and reverence. The choice not to “fix” but to transfigure shows a principled renunciation, though internal contradiction is gentle rather than sharply contested. Emotional cost is implied more than dramatized in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (protect the Siren’s Heart) is crisp and consistent, and her “logically emotional” stance surfaces under pressure with embodied cost. The choice to mirror rather than attack reveals character and values. Internal contradiction (terror felt, calculus acted on) is credible, though she borders on hyper‑competent with few missteps. The exhaustion after victory reads as a paid price rather than a reset.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s contradiction—impatience as a “wild animal” versus the disciplined watcher—drives micro‑choices and culminates in a credible renunciation transformed into action. Embodied details (breath plume, hand steadiness, forehead to basalt) ground emotion. Motivation and action align under pressure in the click to signal “unyoke.” The change at the end reads earned, with cost in the years of restraint becoming legible relief.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s rationalist rigor collides credibly with involuntary sensations, and his micro‑choice to include the psychological context is earned by the notebook find. The internal contradiction (empiricism vs. haunting impressions) is dramatized rather than told. Emotional texture is embodied in tactile observation (mud, scuffs, high‑water mark) rather than labels. The cost—defying Fletcher—reads quietly but plausibly in character.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arthur’s motive—transforming guilt and an impotent apology into useful action—is clear and drives the visit and the final renunciation. Interiority is specific and embodied (penitentiary noise vs. the shop’s hush), and his shift from fixer to guide feels earned. Elias’s past and present stance add credible pressure without stealing POV. A faint neatness in the epiphany (“show them where the light can get in”) trims ambiguity but not fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific drive (“ring a bell no one hears yet”) anchors Kaelen’s choices, with embodied moments (oily hands, strapped harness) under pressure. Internal contradiction is light—he’s almost purely devoted; fear flickers only during the fall. Actions align tightly with motive, and the final acceptance of solitary discovery carries a felt cost. A touch more ambivalence or relational pressure could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—find the last piece of her brother—and her micro-choices under pressure (lying to Kael, using the coordinates as a password) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete (“heart hammered,” “trembling hands”), and the lie reads as a live contradiction: fidelity to truth vs. protection of the investigation. Competence (pattern recognition) is balanced by fear and secrecy. The final act feels earned by prior traits and costs her integrity and safety.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive—mapping empathy onto action—drives every beat and is dramatized through his choice to scry rather than adjudicate. Mara and Jorn gain dimension via the mirror’s glimpses, especially Mara’s grief-laced fear. Internal contradiction in Kael is subtle (calm receptivity vs. pressure to keep the community intact) but present. The resolution is a credible endurance/renunciation of blame with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motive—an euthanasia tourist using catastrophe to “learn the sound of approaching endings”—is specific, ethically fraught, and sustained. Contradictory impulses (helper/parasite; not impatient for death but for comprehension) act simultaneously in scene. Embodied perception (“salt and diesel,” “silver parasol tip cold in her palm”) grounds interiority. The final acceptance reads earned; if anything, the epiphany borders on neatness but is supported by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular, filtered through his craft; the vineyard logic grounds his reframing of the relationship. Contradictory impulses—guarding against a memory vs. tending it—coexist credibly and resolve into an earned renunciation. Micro-choices (handling the letter, scanning the vineyard, pocketing the fragment) align with his motive. The shift avoids therapy-speak except for one slightly academic phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is crystalline and drives each move, and the embodied practice (peripheral awareness) reveals character. However, Kael faces little internal contradiction or visible doubt; he reads competent and certain from start to finish. The “strangely honest” trait triggers his departure and social cost, but the on‑page struggle remains low‑friction. The ending’s endurance/renunciation is credible yet emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive and method—Elias’s calm, ritualized curation reads specific and credible. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he meets little resistance beyond the work’s inherent sorrow. The final renunciation (packing the case and leaving) is earned but the cost is muted. Emotional embodiment lands in tactile details, not therapy-speak, which strengthens credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior is vivid and particular (“folded into the shape of a question mark”), and his patient, reticent temperament plausibly drives the weeks‑long listening. The decisive renunciation—refusing to write and choosing to “testify”—is earned by his discovery that process, not product, is the truth. The on‑page conflict is mostly internal and gentle, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Still, his micro‑choices (listening, charting, choosing silence) reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s drive is clear and particular—“to capture the sound of growing older”—and his desperation/serenity contradiction culminates in the earned renunciation at the stone. Interiority is embodied (chalk dust, hum in teeth) rather than labeled. The final choice (imperfect circle over lost sigil) arises credibly from prior pressure. Minor constraint: stakes remain intimate and largely internal, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motive—“to harness the ephemeral” seeded by grief—is clear and actionable, culminating in the sacrifice of his treasured lens. Interiority is specific (leaf-fall listening, tactile craft), though his internal conflict stays understated; a flicker more doubt or risk calculus under peak pressure could deepen it. Actions align tightly with character, and the renunciation at the end carries credible cost. Hima applies pertinent pressure without diluting his POV.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motives are clear and embodied through concrete action (investigation, decisive call, staging the scene); her “decisively kind” pressure on Lena reads credible. Internal contradiction is minimal—competence outweighs visible doubt—so the arc leans more on endurance than struggle. Lena’s on‑page interiority is slight, but her hesitation and the final handclasp carry authentic charge. The closing endurance (Elara stepping out, accepting what she cannot control) feels earned with a soft but real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, and her “quiet deliberation” shows in the key’s topological alignment and the decision to push rather than turn. Interiority is precise without therapy‑speak, but real internal conflict is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays an emotional price on the page. Competence dominates struggle, trimming depth. Still, actions align with motives and reveal a coherent worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific, embodied, and credibly conflicted: a rational bone‑setter aching for his wife’s faith. His micro‑choices—digging carefully, accepting the tooth, choosing to chart a new constellation—align with a widening motive and visible cost. The self‑indictment (“forgiving himself…would be the work of a lifetime”) lands as earned rather than tidy. No on‑page second character, but the relationship with Elara exerts persistent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—share light without fire—roots in embodied memory of a village blaze and governs every micro‑choice, especially the pause to “weigh its potential.” The interiority is concrete (salt grit, wetted leather, warmed shard) and consistent. Internal conflict is subtle (longing for stars vs. earthbound patience) rather than sharply contradictory, which slightly softens pressure. The final endurance/creation reads earned, with the felt cost being time, labor, and refusal of fire.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “quietly proactive” care culminates in the costly gift of her pendant, a choice that reveals her values under pressure. Kaelen’s numb, haunted presence and his breath’s shift at the end feel embodied and credible. The relationship operates as the crucible: her tenderness risks becoming intrusive, and the pendant offering threads that needle. Minor reservation: Kaelen’s internal contradiction is mostly inferred rather than dramatized through his own micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motive—to face and honor the abandoned ideas that success made him betray—is clear, character‑particular, and tightened by the “current” as embodied despair. Contradictory impulses (self‑loathing vs. duty to the ghosts) act in scene and culminate in a costly renunciation. Tactile choices (gripping and then burying the shell) align cleanly with his values. Occasional abstraction skirts lyric generality but never undermines agency.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s motive—to restore sacred practices for a listless village—is clear and embodied through a tactile process. His tremor and meticulous tuning show credible interiority, though contradictions under pressure are light and he reads largely as competent and assured. Micro-choices (adjusting a note, choosing the vine, when to swell the chant) reveal priorities. The cost is mostly future-facing duty rather than a sharp on-page sacrifice, tempering depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is precise and embodied—he endures the cold to listen and turns fear into a map. Interiority is mostly action-translated rather than reflective, but the physical patience and the thumb‑seal show character under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle (urgency outside vs chosen slowness), not deeply dramatized. The cost—pouring his own stillness and stamina—reads, though the psychological edge could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”) and method-driven micro-choices give him specificity. However, internal conflict is minimal; he rarely strains against an opposing impulse beyond patience and solitude. Emotional embodiment is mostly inferred through ritual and environment rather than felt contradiction. Competence dominates, making the resolution assured rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motive—to gather, calm, and house burdens—is clear and embodied through the ritual, with palpable solitude and care. Interiority is concrete (“a smooth stone he turned over in a mind that stretched across the world”) and choices (coax, align, set) track motivations. Internal contradiction is muted; he endures rather than wrestles with competing impulses. The ending earns an endurance cost—continued confinement and loneliness—without reaching a deeper, contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—parcel grief “while the kettle boils” to extract a usable lesson—is specific and governs her micro‑choices, especially carving an “arc of profound stillness” instead of a figurative lion. Interiority is embodied through tools, scent, and sound; the Tuesday‑cub memory grounds her insight. The internal tension (contain vs. dwell; presence vs. dominance) is quiet but credible. The change is an earned stasis with cost: she limits grief to a window and commits to a discipline rather than catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive (to gather echoes to bargain with his younger ghost) is vivid, specific, and tested by the discovery of the camera wheel. Interiority is textured with contradiction—self‑justifying loops versus the need to own fault—culminating in an earned renunciation. Embodied details (kneeling at the precipice, the plastic teeth, the rasp of his voice) ground his emotions. The final choice forecloses the bargaining path with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive chain is coherent—curiosity to problem‑solving to activation—and her micro‑choices (repurposing carnival generators, interpreting the sextant as nodal coordinates) reveal character. Interior texture is specific (“smell of old ozone and new popcorn”), avoiding stock feeling labels. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely feels genuine doubt or competing impulses beyond a brief pang of disappointment. The final recalibration reads earned but carries limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motive—to make peace with an abandoned dream—is sharply etched and his micro‑choices (slipping out, opening the coffer, arranging the bells) embody it. Interiority is specific (ink‑stained fingers, the coffer’s ache), and the renunciation reads earned. The internal contradiction (the sanctuary’s silence as once‑canvas now‑tomb) is present though not deeply contested on the page. Emotional struggle is quiet but credible, with a visible cost in letting the bells go.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motivation drives each micro‑choice, from poling to grappling to prying the box. Interiority is specific and character‑particular, especially the “tactile conversation with the mud.” The final repricing of his grandfather’s act feels earned by on‑page discovery, though the epiphany edges slightly tidy. No dialogue or second character simplifies but does not diminish pressure on his inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation and method-driven choices (patience, coaxing, decoding) reveal a distinct character. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or pays an explicit emotional price beyond endurance. The endurance reads credible but safe, limiting the felt stakes. Still, actions align tightly with his worldview and culminate in an earned, quiet renunciation of force.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive and method are clear and character‑particular, and his sensory empathy reads embodied rather than generic. The projection choice reveals his values under pressure and leads to a believable internal shift. However, conflicting impulses are muted; the piece favors assurance over live contradiction. The final act of writing feels earned but relatively unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motive—reviving organic beauty—is specific, embodied, and drives concrete micro‑choices (lichen resin over glue, geothermal incubator). His obsessive hypothesizing particularizes interiority without therapy‑speak. The internal conflict (nostalgia for purity vs. acceptance of hybridity) resolves credibly at the end with a felt cost. Minor limitation: little interpersonal pressure or contradictory impulses in-scene beyond the dream vs. reality axis.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are concrete and specific—rewriting an arsonist inheritance by saving a living elder—and her choice to sever the coin thread to bind the graft embodies visible cost. Interiority stays embodied (radio crackle, soot, knife work) rather than abstract. Contradictory impulses (legacy vs. compassion; talisman vs. tool) act in the scene. Minor note: she succeeds with high competence; a touch more friction would deepen flaw-cost texture.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s contradiction—“luminous skeptic” driven by an ache she resists—feels credible and animates each micro‑choice, especially the millimeter‑by‑millimeter rotation. Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in endurance rather than force. The felt cost is mostly pre‑paid (years of patience) rather than newly incurred on the page, keeping the final shift a hair soft. Still, action and interiority align and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, singular motivation (“share light without using fire”) and embodied sentiment anchor Xylar. The approach to the null echo, handling and releasing the gear, and retooling the pings are credible micro-choices. Internal contradiction (heritage-bound sorrow vs. radical hope) is present but lightly tested, making the epiphany feel somewhat tidy. Still, actions align with motive and the renunciation reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—finding the “shape of collective grief”—is clear and organically rooted in his craft and family legacy. Embodied interiority (stone, ribbon textures, storm-sound) keeps emotions grounded while his obsession narrows his life plausibly. The spectral grandmother adds pressure without diluting single-POV integrity. The epiphany risks tidiness but is earned by the iterative retracing and night-by-night cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—to recalibrate a wounded town through ritual precision—is clear and particular, and his interior conflict between containment and release reads in-scene. The ethically diligent trait constrains him, making the “letting go” moment a real test. Embodied detail (oil, brass, salt) grounds emotion without therapy-speak. The end registers as an Earned Stasis: burden accepted with cost, not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—“to discover the shape of intentions left behind”—is clear and consistently pursued through tactile, purposeful actions. Interiority is specific (lantern, threads, star charts), but internal contradiction or costly hesitation is minimal, keeping pressure gentle. The final renaming of the case’s meaning earns a subtle shift more than a fraught choice. Competence dominates struggle, softening the felt cost of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s duty, doubt, and resolve are cleanly motivated and specific to his vocation; the kingfisher quill and engine reactions reveal him under pressure. The internal contradiction—condemning old ways vs. risking extinction—sharpens the final choice. Embodied cues (pulse in ears, breath at the page) ground emotion. Minor reliance on declarative summary keeps it just shy of profound complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motivation (preserving outlawed stories) embodied through tactile choices—tuning, transcribing, revealing. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“thistled calm,” ritual gestures). Internal contradiction (fear vs purpose) is present but lightly dramatized rather than pressure‑tested. The endurance stance at the end feels earned, though the visible cost is more stated than forced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s dual motive—compassionate ritualist and careful withholder—feels specific and consistent, and her micro‑choices (what she omits, how she stages the ritual) reveal character under pressure. Kael’s grief is embodied and credible through action rather than labels. The internal contradiction in Elara (offering peace she knows is a mirage) is present, though not deeply contested on the page. The final “knowing stone” registers cost without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is specific and embodied, with a credible push-pull between contempt for the “Sun-Kissed” and reverence for disciplined knowledge. His micro-choices (not rising, testing the girl with the cog, then filing it away) align with a rational, stubborn temperament. The encounter forces a live question—teach or preserve—that he resolves with felt cost. Emotional texture remains cool but not numb, matching his abrasive calm without flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—to reconcile rival towns through choral harmony—is clear, consistent, and rooted in personal history via the rosette. His internal tension between resignation and persistence is credible and culminates in a concrete methodological shift. Emotional texture is embodied (breath, shoulders, silence) rather than labeled. Secondary characters are collective rather than individual, limiting relational crucible nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—“to create something beautiful from the ruins”—and his palate-as-memory grounds interiority in concrete sensation. Agency is strong, with micro-choices (tasting, pruning specific branches) revealing values. The main softness is limited contradiction or doubt on the page; he scarcely hesitates about ethical cost. Still, the final stance feels earned by the pruning work and sensory tests.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—to preserve wonder despite his truth compulsion—is clear and enacted through the choice to withhold a direct answer and give the riddle. The internal tension between involuntary honesty and anti‑sterility ethos is credible and dramatized. Lena’s shift from weary official to charged seeker also reads cleanly. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—fighting “deadness” through tiny disruptions—and her fear/conviction is embodied (“heart hammered,” sneaker crunch in the rock garden). The internal shift from “sanctifying houses” to nudging occupants is credible and earned via the orris-root beat. Contradictory impulses (risk versus reverence; order versus untidy life) are present but remain gentle. The visible cost is mostly conceptual (giving up the priestess myth), not deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her indoctrinated certainty fractures under accumulating, sensory‑anchored revelations, and her final renunciation is earned. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. witnessed life) operate simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The physical handling of the ampoule and the burial act externalize her internal shift with felt cost. Galen’s “incisively kind” pressure sharpens, rather than softens, her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s goal—extracting the “texture of a missed opportunity”—is specific, consistent, and drives every action. Interiority is vivid and embodied at the rupture (“damp chill… click of a lock”), with a credible fear of unraveling himself. Contradictory impulses (logic’s safety vs risking self‑unraveling) are present but could surface more explicitly at the exact moment of choice. The final renunciation/reframing (prison → canvas) reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s drive—to prove strangers remember kindness—rings clear and animates every choice, from the moonlit painting ritual to the public reveal. His internal push-pull (methodical hope versus creeping doubt) is embodied in the silence after he flips the switches. Interiority is specific (philodendrons, snow-hare bristles, “saffron quiet”) rather than generic. The conflict could show one sharper contradictory impulse under peak pressure, but what’s here is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alistair’s motives are clear and embodied: a curator’s urge to preserve becomes the engine of a survival choice. His historically oriented mind credibly produces the sonic‑resonance tactic, and his status shift from ignored petitioner to conductor tracks. Emotional texture is specific (the emerald lens as comfort and tool; the warm ‘A’ as catalyst). Internal conflict is present but light; despair to resolve turns quickly without much on‑page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline (“to step beyond fate’s design”), and he acts on it through concrete, risky choices (fitting the final gear, pulling the lever). Interiority is textured and embodied (“ozone and cold brass,” “bleak exhilaration”), with credible ambivalence between terror and compulsion. Internal conflict is present but not deeply contoured beyond resolve versus fear. The final choice feels earned and carries cost as his body and history begin to unspool.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (to bait and expose Fear) drives each move, and embodied perception (“sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie”) sustains interiority. The protagonist holds contradictory impulses—shame about the void versus tactical use of it—culminating in an earned confession. Micro‑choices (avoiding mirrors, following paradoxical cues, seizing the clasp) align with pressure. The final reconfiguration (void as weapon) feels motivated and forecloses a path, with the cost of enduring emptiness intact.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kai’s competence, anticipatory anxiety, and craftsman‑mind are concrete and embodied (“not of fear, but of anticipation for the performance”). Micro‑choices (where to strike, when to time the notes) align with motive. Internal contradiction is light—he’s largely a serene adept—so the cost reads more physical than moral. Still, his worldview is revealed through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clean and compelling—grief transmuted into disciplined obsession—and it drives concrete choices (deciphering, then playing the sequence). The internal countercurrent (dread vs. compulsion) is embodied rather than labeled, especially in the sun-as-pressure motif. His reactions to the whistle and the watchers reveal character under strain. While largely solitary, the social pressure of neighbors thinking him mad sharpens his endurance without bloating the cast.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s precise, methodical temperament and Elara’s inherited duty are clear, and the negotiation reveals their values under pressure. Elara’s shift from “sacred burden” to “millstone” lands as a credible internal turn. Interiority is present without navel‑gazing, though emotion stays mostly disciplined rather than contradictory in-body. A touch more embodied struggle at the handover could deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s stoic exterior and tender interior are dramatized, not told, especially in the frantic, bodily search for the inkwell. Micro‑choices—writing the salvaged sentence, deciding to seal it despite the mishap—reveal value hierarchy. The cost (scraped knuckles, risk, shaken composure) grounds his devotion. Slight idealization creeps in, but it’s kept honest by tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motive—“to trace honest origins”—is concrete and drives each micro‑choice from opening the salt‑sealed drawer to testing the stamp by moss light. Interiority is specific and embodied (gloved finger on discoloration; kneeling to catch phosphorescence). The final renunciation (not announcing) is earned but the internal contradiction is mild; he rarely wrestles with competing impulses, keeping the arc more serene than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s grief-driven agency is concrete and particular—he copes by working his hands, polishing the mnemonic gem as “a slow, abrasive prayer.” Contradictory impulses (paralyzed heart vs. competent hands; ascending vs. descending) operate simultaneously on the page. His final renunciation—accepting the broken promise while choosing to fold the crane—reads earned and costly. Minor limitation: the internal conflict remains largely lyric; a sharper moment of waver under pressure could intensify the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amal’s motivation is crystalline—grief transmuted into a physics-driven hunt—and her micro-choices (pushing the array, refining boundary conditions under time pressure) enact it. Embodied details (white knuckles, warm geode) keep emotion grounded. Internal contradiction is present as “bleak exhilaration,” though the conflict could tighten with one sharper costed hesitation. Actions and worldview align throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal is clear and sustained—decode the “frequency of belonging”—and her tactics (inserting the chip, piloting the drone, pulling the handle) align with motive. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her professional gaze. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little ambivalence or cost beyond effort. The final peace is earned but a bit tidy emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, specific motive (quell the “sieved hush”) and embodied guilt (“watch hand” in palm) drive concrete micro‑choices (descending to the shore, sifting wood, thumb in groove). Internal conflict is credible: pride in false‑memory skill turned curse, and the final turn reframes that flaw into purpose. The shift to “restore true ones” is earned by the revelation and costs him morally. Slight telliness in the resolve paragraph keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s motive—recycling mistakes into wisdom—is concrete and embodied in the lion pull, guiding careful, risk‑aware choices. Interiority is specific (salt, stone, brass’s chill), and his read of Kaelen shows empathetic, professional acuity. The change is an earned endurance: trust enacted under pressure with visible cost from past tragedy. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper in‑scene wobble could have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and embodied—align heart and action—and contradictions (sea‑pull vs land‑penance) operate simultaneously in scene. Specific reactions to the compass, poles, and the laughing couple reveal a particular psyche under pressure. The closing micro‑choice (stepping beyond the last pole, offering the compass) feels earned and forecloses avoidance with felt cost. Minor reliance on familiar metaphors doesn’t blunt the interior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive (court‑mandated empathy) drives concrete choices—archive sleuthing, the descent, the islet. Interiority is specific (“hollow spaces between his thoughts”) and embodied through sensory pressure underground. The detachment vs. yearning conflict is present and his final stance feels earned. A touch of abstract phrasing (“desert of ash”) softens peak specificity but doesn’t derail credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motive—to reforge a bond rather than resurrect a body—is specific and coherent, with embodied conflict (“He wanted her, not to become her”). The steady ritual under grief and the surrender at peak pressure reveal credible contradictory impulses. Micro‑choices (opening the box, grinding, pushing past fear) align with his values. The cost—erasure of human form—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—terror of time’s slipstream after childbirth—feels specific, embodied, and consistent with the cartomancer who distrusts her own shortcuts. Contradictory impulses (adoration vs. loss-anxiety) act simultaneously in scene and drive the choice to renounce the quest. Micro-choices around the saucer, cloak clasp, and new linen reveal priorities under pressure. The final renunciation is a touch tidy but earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s pacifist method—acceptance over force—consistently drives her choices and culminates in offering a “healed soul” rather than breaching the aperture by power. Interiority is embodied and specific (weight/float tied to emotion), with credible strain under her own childhood photo. The final renunciation of violence and embrace of burden reads earned and costly. A touch more contradiction mid‑process (doubt or avoidance) could deepen the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s desire “to understand the texture of transformation” is clear and consistent, and his “philanthropist of moments” identity aligns with releasing his only treasure. Interiority is evocative but largely serene; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal. The detour and the choice to release the fireflies reveal values, yet the emotional cost reads gentle rather than fraught. Still, the final kneeling with empty bottles lands as an earned, quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—to spark a silent revolution—is clear and consistently enacted, and the body-level tension (tremor vs. composure) gives him texture. His competence dominates, with little friction or mistake to complicate the choice, so the internal conflict remains mild. The micro-choices around concealment and timing read specific and character-driven. However, the outcome arrives without a visible personal cost or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motives are clear and particular—protect the nexus and honor Elara’s promise while wrestling with a precognitive burden. Interiority is image-driven (magnetic boots groaning, eels tracing fractals) rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses surface subtly (guard the patterns vs. spend the last‑resort star dust, ignore the eels’ distress vs. shepherd identity). The endurance choice lands, though a sharper on‑page cost to his psyche or relationships could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular: “furiously tranquil” manifests in the disciplined hour of waiting and the tremor after the ping. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously (statue body vs. hurricane mind), and his choice to open the envelope after the imposed hour feels earned. The shift from mapping scars to developing them lands as a credible reconfiguration of motive. Minor note: a relational crucible is off-page, so pressure is largely self-generated, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen’s motive—turning questions into destinations—is clear and embodied by his choice to “fence” the sundial. Interiority is tasteful but thin; we get poise and will more than contradiction or doubt. The mechanical arm and professional ethos texture his actions without generating visible internal conflict. The final decision to strike the seam feels earned, if emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s monthly molt (Reckoner → Architect) gives him a credible internal contradiction that informs his choices, notably welcoming the drifters. Motivation to rebuild and seed poems is clear and embodied in action. Interiority is economical yet specific (“cathedral of decay,” the prison library memory), though the cost of suppressing the Reckoner is implied more than tested. Elara functions as stabilizing counter‑pressure, but their dynamic faces only a light on‑page test.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motive—defying fate to reach her—is clear and consistently embodied in action. The shift from lament to weaponized artistry (“forging his wistful melodies into something more akin to a blade”) grounds him as particular rather than generic. Some inner contradiction (fear vs. resolve) is implied more than dramatized in the moment of stepping through. Still, choices align tightly with character.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s duty-versus-doubt contradiction is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (abandoning instruments, layering the Sleepers’ dreams, choosing to sing and plant) reveal values under pressure. Emotions are embodied (metallic tang, panic prickling, bone-deep thrum). The leap from analysis to faith feels earned by prior tracking of dream data. The visible cost is accepting uncertainty as integral to memory rather than banishing it.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kenji’s grief‑driven motive is clear and specific, filtered through tactile rituals (bonsai, lace decoding, the compass). Contradictory impulses (penance via stasis vs the risk of release) are present and expressed in concrete acts. The shift from guilt’s “crystalline shard” to diffusion feels earned by the prior months of deciphering. Slight tidiness in the final articulation (“He had been so wrong”) trims some ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional. Aris's internal conflict between scientific detachment and embodied grief is dramatized with precision, not just stated. The shift from wanting "to strip needless drama" to accepting it as "the process itself" is a profound and earned change, with the cost—the loss of his serene intellectual distance—made palpable in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kaelen’s motivation to find "purpose in the pauses" is not just stated but fully dramatized through her shift from active creation to passive observation. The internal conflict—fear of the fire versus the artist's need to create—is embodied in the specific, visceral detail of her hands shaking, making her final, deliberate return to the kiln a deeply earned and powerful change.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is powerfully dramatized at the climax when her trauma intrudes. The central choice to weave the conflicting emotions into a new whole is earned and shows a specific, contradictory interiority. A slight deduction is for moments of overly direct psychological summary, such as "Her motivation was simple and all-consuming," which tells the reader what could have been fully revealed through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, driving the narrative with a quiet, desperate force. His interiority is conveyed through strong, specific imagery (“a constant, psychic static that frayed the edges of his world”) rather than labels. The character’s defining trait of being “inadvertently stubborn” is perfectly demonstrated by his immediate, unhesitating choice to journey to the library, making the fantastic believable through sheer force of will. The final earned change to “gentle, welcome calm” is deeply satisfying and feels completely earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from physical provision to cultural restoration in a credible, compelling arc. Her internal state is well-embodied in the story's atmosphere, and her final decision to renounce the mystery of the benefactor in favor of community action is an earned, resonant choice. The progression is slightly more linear than a dramatization of simultaneous contradictory impulses, which is what holds it just shy of a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply integrated into her character as a "pilgrim of sparks." Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific emotion—the "persistent ache" and the feeling of a "phantom limb"—which compellingly drives her micro-choices within the ritual. The final change is earned through this focused action, and her contradictory state of "foggy lucidity" feels authentic rather than summarized. The execution is flawless, showing a character whose core traits directly produce the story's central action and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The motivation to "discover the texture of time" provides a powerful, ironic frame for the tragedy. The internal conflict is embodied in the "terrifying comfort" of the fragment, and the final state of earned emptiness is a direct, devastating consequence of his singular ambition and desperate final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is powerfully clear and her actions are perfectly aligned with her "patiently strategic mind." The characterization is strong and consistent, particularly the embodiment of her long-honed purpose. The story demonstrates competence under pressure effectively, but lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or a contradictory impulse in-scene, which slightly flattens the arc from a state of perfect readiness to a state of perfect fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is singular, potent, and deeply integrated with his unique perceptual abilities. His interiority is expressed not through labels but through the concrete, synesthetic goal of capturing a "jagged shard of violet-grey." The final change—from seeking to capture pain to containing its absence—is a subtle, earned reconfiguration of his goal, demonstrating a mature character arc that avoids a simplistic cure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas's motivation is established with compelling clarity and uniqueness. The final transformation from "thief of memories" to "custodian of possibilities" is a significant change, but his internal journey feels slightly frictionless. The initial "fear and exhilaration" is well-handled, but his acceptance of the supernatural premise is swift, and the final epiphany reads more as an intellectual insight than a deeply embodied, contradictory emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is precise, and her internal conflict between artistic purpose and survival is powerfully dramatized. The shift from a performative coping mechanism (“dramatically narrating”) to genuine fear is a highlight, revealing character under pressure. The final choice to abandon her creation feels both inevitable and costly, earning the story's emotional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is sharp and evolves convincingly from survival to a reclamation of self. The internal conflict is clear, and the final shift to "violent, powerful certainty" is earned. However, the story occasionally relies on diagnostic self-awareness ("This was a vulnerability I couldn't process") and thematic summary ("My motivation was...to prove that this aching vulnerability...was my greatest source of power"), which slightly flattens the interiority in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, with his purpose ("worn smooth by his purpose") embodied in his actions and the story's imagery. The interiority is specific, particularly the re-framing of his obsession as that of a "watchmaker," which adds precision to an abstract state. The final earned stasis is convincing, but the characterization lacks a layer of internal contradiction, holding it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and earned over the story's established timeline. The transition from a simple janitorial routine to a profound metaphysical quest is seamless. The interiority is superb, using machine-specific language ("logic processors," "error warnings") to convey a struggle between programming and emergent consciousness, culminating in the critical and character-defining choice to "calmly [bypass] them all." This action embodies the internal conflict and demonstrates a hierarchy of values with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is established immediately and compellingly: a yearning to bridge a silent gap. His internal conflict is embodied in his actions—passively collecting tickets versus the decisive, risky choice to eavesdrop. The final act of offering the lens is a powerful, earned gesture that aligns perfectly with his established character, demonstrating a change in tactics from passive yearning to active, vulnerable honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias's character is expertly rendered through his actions and core philosophy. His interiority is concrete, avoiding cliché, and his motivation is unwavering. The final choice to deliberately crack the pristine marble is a masterful, earned act that perfectly encapsulates his worldview, demonstrating a complex internal state rather than a simple victory.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    The characterization is efficient and strong. Elias's motivation as an "obliging" professional is clear, and his perspective as a practical man grounds the high-concept physics. Aris's obsession is well-embodied in his trembling hands and tearful vindication. Elias's final internal shift from practitioner to someone with a recalibrated soul is earned, but his role is slightly more of a lens for the story's idea than a character wrestling with a deep internal conflict prior to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is sharp, consistent, and drives the narrative from obsession to resolution. The shift in his purpose from "unravel a code" to "give it life" marks a compelling and earned character change for this length. While his interiority is generally well-realized, a few phrases like "a strange creative fever gripping him" verge on telling, slightly softening an otherwise concrete portrayal of artistic obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is established immediately and her internal conflict—the need for certainty versus the need for ambiguity—is dramatized with nuance rather than summarized. The "fault-tolerant oracle" concept is integrated well, framing her final realization not as a breakdown but as her system processing a paradox perfectly. The final choice to embrace uncertainty is earned and the cost is felt, fulfilling the internal arc with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with striking clarity and force in the first paragraph, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The internal conflict between his religious skepticism and the impossible events is dramatized effectively, not just stated. The climactic connection between his own failure to act ("I did nothing") and the spectral crisis is masterful, earning the final emotional shift through a choice rooted in his deepest flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent. The internal conflict is embodied through sensory details like "seeing the ghosts of long-dead scribes" and the "symphony of seawater and screams." The choice to seek the refuge feels inevitable and earned, and the final state of renewal is credibly achieved with the felt cost of its impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong and embodied, particularly for Lena. However, Elias's interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic label-speak, slightly over-articulating the therapeutic intent in moments of high pressure, as seen in the thought "to bind the memory of loss with the memory of the immense love." This abstracts the emotion rather than letting the action carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kaelen's motivation is established immediately and his defining trait—a "sensitively perceptive nature"—is dramatized, not just stated, in his handling of the diaries. The final shift from seeker to "archivist of the ache" is a powerful, earned moment of renunciation. His interiority is specific and embodied, culminating in a "profound sorrow, heavy and resonant as bronze" that provides a tangible cost to his discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb. Elias's motivation—seeking an elegant harmony—is established early and provides a powerful, consistent engine for both the external plot and his final, life-altering decision. The internal contradiction of being a distant controller who yearns for a new song is beautifully realized. The final choice feels entirely earned, a natural culmination of his stated philosophy turned inward.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Alistair's characterization is strong, defined by his unique, methodical actions rather than exposition. His motivation is clear and consistent, compelling his choices in a high-stakes scenario. The one minor weakness is the direct statement of his motivation ("His motivation was not simply..."), which is a slight "tell" in an otherwise impeccably "shown" story, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptional: the abstract “chronologically homesick” is grounded in a physical “ache” and a grand ambition. The character’s arc from an active “conductor” to a receptive “listener” is earned through the story’s central struggle, and his final action—writing a personal fortune—provides a perfect, quiet closure that demonstrates this change. His interiority is specific and avoids cliché, making his final, earned peace feel profound.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb, with a clear motivation that is tested and transformed. The internal conflict between fighting and accepting trauma is dramatized effectively, not just summarized. The final change feels earned, particularly the moment he feels the "solid press of the ground," which provides a powerful, embodied resolution that contrasts with his initial weightlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent: a war against emotional numbness. Her interiority is beautifully embodied through her sensory focus on vibration, and her core action—using the painful relic of the broken needle to create a new form of healing—is a powerful contradictory impulse in action. The final earned stasis, where her relationship to silence is transformed, feels fully earned by this central, grace-filled struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias’s motivation to protect his "fragile integrity" through solitude and data is not just stated but demonstrated in his every action, from his meticulous approach to the pigeon to his ultimate decision. The internal conflict is clear—his ordered world versus an intrusive human chaos—and his resolution to engage with that chaos on his own terms feels both surprising and inevitable. His professional mindset directly enables the story's unique resolution, making his character inseparable from the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is crystalline and his internal conflict between cautious self-protection and the desperate need for understanding is dramatized effectively. The final transformation from fearing memory to accepting it is earned through the story's central revelation. The shift is palpable in his final action—"Elias finally breathed it all in"—a micro-choice that pays off his entire internal journey with a clear, felt cost of confronting his pain head-on.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Elias's motivation is singular and clear, and his interiority is rendered with specific, poetic language (e.g., "library of burned books"). His final choice is a powerful act of Earned Stasis, credibly rooted in his established identity as a poet who values the "smudges on the paper."

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and exquisitely tied to her actions. The internal conflict—the desire to create versus the need to preserve the quiet—is resolved not through a simple choice, but through a redefinition of the act of creation itself. The final feeling of a heart that is "full, not with noise, but with completion" is a perfectly earned change of state with a palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" is expertly dramatized. His internal conflict is not just stated but embodied when he absorbs the contradictory charges of joy and sorrow. The final choice to bear the cost of his craft is earned and resonant, making his characterization both specific and profound. The contradiction of "affectionate detachment" is demonstrated, not just labeled, in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Characterization is clear and consistent, with motivations rooted in established traits. Elias's shift from a shrewd broker to a whimsical benefactor is believable because it's framed as a calculated risk. However, the internal conflict feels more summarized than embodied; phrases like "felt a profound click of understanding" tell us the emotional result rather than letting us experience the process. The characters are compelling but lack the deeper contradictions that would elevate them to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the narrative. The internal conflict between his transient art and the community's permanence is established immediately and elegantly. The shift from solitary artist to communal caretaker is earned through his on-page choices, especially the pivotal act of weaving the protective mats, making his final acceptance feel both profound and inevitable. The contradiction between his shyness and the "boldly sympathetic" push to act is dramatized effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is well-established, but his climactic solution feels more like an unearned epiphany than a discovery rooted in his established skills. The leap from observing the pendant’s resonance to knowing he must drip an “idea” of a beat into the water is a convenience that slightly undermines the character’s agency. While his role as an illustrator provides a strong thematic frame, the mechanics of his final insight lack a clear causal link to his prior knowledge or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elian's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific—to map his grief—and is pursued through every action. The interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding generic emotional labels in favor of concepts like "the mathematics of emotion." The final shift from a formless specter of grief to an ordered, understood structure is a profound character change, earned entirely by the causality of the preceding ritual and its visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions align perfectly with his established traits. The final "quiet click of satisfaction" provides a strong, earned emotional beat. The score is capped below 9.0 because the core motivation is stated directly ("to become visible to those who need you") rather than purely emerging from action, which slightly lessens the interior complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, particularly in how Elias's internal conflict is embodied through his actions with the trellis and his "circuitously sincere" habit of talking to plants. His motivation is clear and his final shift is earned. The contradiction between his professional knowledge of plant adaptation and his personal rigidity is powerfully rendered without being overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is established with elegant precision and directly drives his actions, culminating in a choice that redefines his entire artistic and personal quest. The internal conflict between capturing an object's aesthetic meaning versus its human meaning is dramatized effectively in the exchange. The final beat, where he sketches the woman's face instead of the landscape, provides a powerful and earned character change, fulfilling the 9+ quick test of contradictory impulses resolved with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s characterization is exceptional, centered on a powerful internal conflict between her trusted duty and the cave’s emergent will. Her transformation from a confident guardian to a questioning participant is earned through specific, dramatized pressures, not just summary. The final realization she was a "fearful jailer" is a touch on-the-nose, but its delivery as the content of a vision makes it feel like an earned, concrete event rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, driving every action without deviation. His interiority is well-embodied, particularly in the description of his visionary flashes as a "phantom echo" rather than a clear image. The woman serves as an effective crucible, her brief appearance forcing Kaelen's abstract purpose into a concrete, human-scaled resolution. The final dialogue exchange is the single weak point; Kaelen's line "Nothing is ever completely lost" verges on summarizing the theme rather than letting the moment breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, with a clear, absolute motivation driving the narrative. Elias's internal state is conveyed through the specific contradiction of "trembling certainty," which evolves into a "profound calm." His primary trait—the analytically artistic mind—is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The final choice is an acceptance of responsibility, a powerful shift that is well-earned by the preceding journey and revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between his "bedrock facts" skepticism and his love-driven duty is established immediately and drives the narrative. The transformation feels earned, pivoting on the beautiful line "With trembling, courageously kind hands—kind to her memory, kind to this wild hope." The final shift to "profound acceptance" is a complete and satisfying resolution to a well-dramatized internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Xylos's motivation is exceptionally clear and scaled appropriately to his cosmic nature; the "star-crushing boredom" provides a powerful engine for the plot. The internal conflict is well-realized as a struggle against his own nature, embodied by the amulet. The final choice feels earned, as his purpose has "calcified" beyond pain or memory, showing a believable transformation through sheer endurance rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s central motivation—the honest child’s search for equilibrium to counteract her con-artist father’s legacy—is established with immediate clarity and drives every choice. The internal conflict is expertly dramatized in the climax: using her father's dishonest tools to achieve a profoundly moral end. This contradiction is perfectly captured in the line, "the most dishonest thing she had ever done, and the most profoundly fair."

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, potent, and beautifully rendered. Her interiority during the process—the focused translation of non-memory, culminating in a feeling of "incandescent restraint"—is both specific and emotionally resonant. The character is defined entirely through her meticulous actions and her relationship to her craft, creating a portrait of profound artistic solitude that feels earned and complete within the story's tight scope.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is singular, compelling, and perfectly aligned with their strange circumstances. Interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity, avoiding all cliché; the desire "to discover the texture of memories" is a brilliant engine for the character's focused, poignant actions. The final state of endurance—a clarified purpose within the stasis of their condition—is earned with profound emotional weight, fulfilling the 9+ test of a renunciation earned by causality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization of Elias is superb, particularly the central contradiction of his "gloomy cheerfulness," which is earned and beautifully paid off in the final paragraph. His motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply felt, stemming from an intellectual obsession that has cost him professionally. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché; the memory of the colleague’s mockery provides sharp, efficient backstory that fuels his present determination. The change at the end is a profound acceptance of a new, solitary purpose, making for a compelling and complete arc within the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation and internal conflict are presented with excellent clarity, particularly the "dual allegiance" between raging against the Consortium and the orderly need to reorganize. However, his core trait as a "culture shock absorber" and his emotional state are often conveyed through summary ("He felt the torment") rather than fully embodied action or perception in the moment. The character works beautifully as a catalyst for the plot, but his interiority could be rendered with more texture.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a potent combination of legacy and personal rebellion. The interiority is rendered with precision, particularly the shift from a "curious ache" to a "profound, dawnlit melancholy" and finally the "beautiful ache" that defines the story's closure. This progression is earned through on-page events, and his micro-choices—using the old grain, the mechanical camera—perfectly embody his values without needing to state them. A hairline weakness is the slightly abstract phrasing of the initial ache, but it's quickly grounded by action.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation, “to decode feedback into direction,” is not merely stated but fully embodied in her actions and unique methodology. Her “magnetic calm” creates a powerful core of stability against the external urgency, and her blindness is masterfully presented as a source of profound insight rather than a limitation. The character is specific, consistent, and compelling, with her internal state driving every beat of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is sharp and consistent, evolving credibly from weary professionalism to focused awe. The internal conflict between his empirical training and his mentor's esoteric legacy is dramatized effectively through his actions, culminating in the acceptance of a new role. The line "His life's work as a man who charted static places was a joke" lands with the full force of an earned renunciation, making his final micro-choice to grab the spectrograph a powerful change in stance. The characterization is flawless, with contradictory impulses—skepticism and trust—coexisting until the climax resolves them.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a functional and consistent character, but he serves more as a vessel for the story's impressive central concept than as a complex individual. His motivation is clear and his actions are aligned, but he lacks any meaningful internal conflict or flaw that complicates his task. His infinite patience and absolute focus make him highly competent, but also somewhat one-dimensional within this brief window, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is singular, powerful, and tested under extreme pressure. The internal conflict between survival instinct and the pursuit of a life's purpose is dramatized with visceral intensity, culminating in a choice that is both tragic and transcendent. The final renunciation of survival for meaning is earned by the preceding struggle, making the character arc feel complete and profound within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator's motivation—to find a truth to escape his father's legacy of lies—is established with immediate clarity and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict is sharp and palpable, culminating in a choice that perfectly embodies his struggle: he gains his truth at the explicit cost of being perceived as a liar. The final lines crystallize an earned endurance, a renunciation of the need for external validation, which feels both tragic and triumphant.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian's motivation to understand the presence is clear, but his role is largely that of a passive observer until the final infusion of knowledge. The climactic revelation of his past life is delivered as a reflection block; while effective for this story's length and tone, it bypasses the drama of discovery, making the character arc feel received rather than actively achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative arc from quiet hope to desperate, conscious action. His interiority is consistent and poetic, but lacks a deep, simultaneous contradiction; his emotional progression is more linear than conflicted. The climax, where his "old-world skills" give substance to the "new-world vision," is a powerful synthesis of trait and action, earning the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict between her inherited skepticism and her desire for connection is well-established. The final emotional shift is earned through her physical actions, satisfying the 9+ test for causality, but a few moments of over-articulated interiority, like "the more significant reconstruction was happening within her," slightly hedge the embodiment and prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving every action from the use of the clipboard to the chalk. However, the characterization lacks an active internal conflict; he is a practitioner of a philosophy, not a person struggling with it in the scene. His competence is absolute, and while his purpose is articulated ("to discover meaning in the margins"), there is no moment of doubt or contradictory impulse that would elevate the portrayal from a skillful sketch to a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, achieving depth through the seamless integration of her craft, motivation, and actions. The central contradiction—her external appearance as a "harmless eccentric" versus her sharp, intuitive mind—is dramatized, not just stated, culminating in the deft use of the terminal. Her motivation to "listen for unheard stories" is a powerful, non-generic driver that elegantly fuses her personality with the plot's demands, and the final image of her returning to her work provides a perfect moment of earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is precise and deeply embodied. Elara’s motivation—clarity over comfort—is established immediately and her professional weariness is made palpable through physical detail ("bruised with shadow," "hollowing her out"). Kael is an effective foil, his quiet desperation providing the catalyst and his final, broken reaction confirming the stakes. The internal states are rendered with specificity, avoiding cliché and earning the story's closing emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's interiority is rendered with concrete specifics—the brain coral as a "physical knot of memory"—and his professional skills are seamlessly transposed onto an emotional problem. The General’s transformation is credible because it is so minimal and potent; the shift from a "mask of command" to a father is shown in a flicker and a single, gentle touch, earning the story's entire emotional weight. The internal conflict in Elias, being a calm center while managing his own anxieties, provides a consistent, subtle tension.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his internal conflict between desperation and the required gentleness is well-dramatized. The final emotional shift from an "ache" to "pensive mirth" is a mature and earned resolution, representing a credible change. The characterization is specific and moving, fulfilling the core requirements for excellence with a believable internal arc and a cost-laden final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, anchored by the trait "methodically playful," which is demonstrated, not just stated. The core motivation shifts believably from a desire to escape to a desire for discovery, an arc made tangible by his actions. The internal conflict between the certainty of his craft and the exhilarating uncertainty of the garden is the story's engine, and the final choice is a perfectly earned culmination of this struggle, showing a profound change with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative from his initial observation to his final, high-stakes choice. The shift from his "charming facade" to the "raw steel beneath" is an effective, earned character change under pressure. Aris serves as a perfect secondary character, efficiently delivering exposition and amplifying the stakes with her credible fear, which makes Kaelen's resolve feel even stronger. The final choice is a direct and powerful expression of his core drive.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the central transformation feels more declared than dramatized. The shift from torment to acceptance is articulated in a summary ("the familiar torment...started to feel less like a cage"), an epiphany that lacks a preceding on-page micro-choice or struggle. While the interiority is lyrical, it verges on diagnostic self-awareness with phrases like "blossom armistice," which names the change rather than embodying it through contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elian's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply integrated with his actions. The internal conflict between his duty to preserve and the "foxglove regret" of that preservation is embodied, not just stated. The characterization is powerful and consistent, with his micro-choices during the ritual revealing a profound, weary dedication that makes the final moment of Earned Stasis resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is singular, sharp, and sustained. His internal conflict—the “carefully reckless precision” required for a desperate, arrogant act of love—is beautifully embodied in the central action. The final choice to create the symphony is an earned culmination of his established traits, and the cost of his vulnerability is made tangible through the blood and the risk, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear, specific to his profession, and compellingly dramatized. The internal conflict between logic and emotion is not just stated but resolved through a character-specific action (deciphering a puzzle). The final transformation is earned and profound, with the cost of his prior worldview legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between self-protective isolation and a yearning for connection is rendered with exceptional clarity and depth. The shift from inventing histories to confessing the truth is not an abrupt epiphany but an earned transformation, catalyzed by external pressure and a burgeoning trust. His lie about the meteorite, "the words tasting like ash," provides a moment of palpable self-revulsion that perfectly motivates his later vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian's motivation is clear and evolves believably from a conceptual need (understanding thresholds) to a practical one (navigating chaos). The character is defined by his inherited skills, which he uses effectively to drive the plot. The final action, analyzing the new chair, provides a strong, resonant closure to his arc, showing his change from "lost child" to a master of his own chosen state; this is a very strong finish.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. Elara provides effective secondary pressure as a skeptical foil. The final emotional change is earned, but slightly undermined by the over-articulated epiphany in the last paragraph, which reads more like a diagnostic summary ("Belonging wasn’t about finding a replacement...") than an embodied realization in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent: a professional, cheerful curiosity that is tested by the ticking clock. The shift from methodical investigation to a "desperate conjecture" is a credible micro-choice under pressure, revealing their core drive. While the characterization is effective and serves the plot perfectly, it lacks a deeper layer of internal contradiction or a truly difficult trade-off, keeping it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are perfectly consistent, embodying the "show, don't tell" principle. The characterization is sharp, though it presents a figure of near-flawless competence whose internal conflict is minimal. The core contradiction between his meticulous control and the wild beauty he creates is externalized, leaving his interiority more observational than conflicted, which slightly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is sharp and his interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion, moving from frustration to a profound state change. The final transformation is earned by a specific, character-driven micro-choice—shifting focus from external to internal voids. This act is a perfect fusion of character, action, and theme, with the cost of permanence making the change meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.5)
    Silas's character is exceptionally realized. His motivation to "illuminate value" is not just stated but embodied in his life's work and his method of seeking clarity. The final choice to accept the atrium's fate is a profound and earned renunciation, stemming directly from his reflective nature, making the contradictory impulses of creator and observer land with a quiet, powerful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias is a well-realized character, with his defining contradiction embodied in the "gently skilled motion at odds with his calloused, powerful hands." His motivation is clear and compelling. The characterization is weakened by the final paragraphs, which resort to explicitly stating his purpose ("This was Elias's ultimate purpose... to enlighten them..."), a narrative intrusion that replaces earned inference with a summary of his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, defining her as a unique "logical dreamer" rather than a standard hero. Her actions align perfectly with her stated goal of finding a "repeatable, elegant proof." However, the characterization lacks a deeper layer of internal conflict; she is presented as supremely competent and focused, with the only struggle being external to the experiment's outcome, which prevents the character from reaching the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her professional lens provides a unique and consistent filter for the narrative. Her final choice to chart the echo and leave the evidence constitutes a powerful moment of Earned Stasis, foreclosing the path of personal crusade. While her internal conflict is more subtle than contradictory, her micro-choices are deliberate and her professional competence is well-established, making the final renunciation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character is a well-realized archetype, and his motivation is clear and consistent. His interiority is conveyed through potent, controlled actions rather than extensive reflection, fitting the story's tone. However, the character lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction on the page; he is a near-perfect conduit for his art, which makes him compelling as a figure but slightly less so as a character with complex, competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is efficient and strong, particularly for the POV character, Elias. His motivations and methods are clear and consistent. While the generals Vorlag and Kaelen serve their narrative function as granite-like obstacles, their swift turn towards peace hinges heavily on the concept of "weariness" and the power of the ritual, making their internal shift feel slightly accelerated for the depth of their stated hatred.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is superb, built on the potent internal contradiction of the ruthless pragmatist haunted by a sentimental memory. This conflict is not just stated but embodied in the key action: “His fingers, which had signed contracts that desiccated entire ecosystems, trembled as they cradled the egg.” The final earned stasis, where he finds resonance instead of forgiveness, is a mature and powerful resolution for this complex character.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is conveyed through a strong, poetic voice, though it occasionally relies on high-level conceptual statements ("She was driven by a single, unwavering purpose...") rather than embodied internal conflict. The character concept is compelling, and her final action feels earned by the decade of work described.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kaelen’s characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction between his serene, urbane exterior and his subversive artistic mission is made tangible through his internal debate. His motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, leading to an earned change that feels like a difficult evolution, not a simplistic reversal. The final shift from a "shield" of composure to the "calm of a craftsman with a sudden and absolute purpose" is a masterful, earned transition.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization of Elias as an "esoteric realist" is expertly realized. His motivation is profound yet understated, and his actions—the quiet, reverent construction of his signals—are a perfect embodiment of his philosophy. The internal conflict between accepting reality and the deep need to perform an act of honor is palpable and resolved with a quiet, earned grace. The final choice to simply leave, his duty done, feels inevitable and true to the man established in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elian’s motivation is established with exceptional clarity and depth, rooted in a past failure and the process of self-forgiveness. His interiority is conveyed through potent, embodied phrases like "snowmelt ardor," which contrast beautifully with the setting. The final shift in his goal—from restoring sound to preserving its light-form—represents an earned and resonant character change, fulfilling his core drive in an unexpected way.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply integrated with his unique perceptual flaw. The internal conflict between his fractured sight and the need for present action is not just stated but embodied in the prose. The final choice is an earned, satisfying culmination of his internal journey, with the shift from tormented guardian to a man experiencing the present feeling both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kavi's characterization is superb, established through the central principle of "conservation" which motivates both his quiet life and the meticulous ritual. The internal conflict—"a prospect that always felt empirically ironic to him"—adds a brilliant layer of intellectual honesty without undermining his devotion. The final act of erasing his work is a perfect, earned expression of his character, valuing private knowledge over any form of possession or proof.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's characterization as a "scheming pacifist" is successfully demonstrated through her intricate, non-violent methods. Her motivation is singular and powerfully drives the narrative. The final cost of her success—dissolving back into reality—provides a meaningful, earned cadence to her arc, showing that her existence was tied to the function she performed. The characterization of Vale as a primal, wounded force is also effective, serving as a potent antagonist without needing complex interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is both clear and deeply felt, rooted in a specific personal history that fuels the story's central action. The tension between her "firmly grounded" nature and her magical, desperate goal creates compelling internal conflict. The final shift from seeking to capture the dream to understanding it as a map is an earned and satisfying character change, supported by the embodied emotion of the tear of "sorrow and triumph."

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian's characterization is exceptional, with a clear and compelling motivation that is tested under pressure. The internal conflict between his rigid traditionalism and love for his daughter is embodied and powerful, culminating in a change that feels earned, not declared. The discovery of the ribbon and seed provides a perfect catalyst, and the cost of his transformation—the surrender of his professional pride—is palpable. The final paragraph slightly over-articulates his new understanding, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise flawless portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kaelen’s core motivation—the pursuit of forbidden knowledge against his mandate—is clear, consistent, and drives every beat of the narrative. The internal conflict is embodied in the "pressure of the paradoxes," and his arc from "perpetually bewildered" to possessing a "new and terrible clarity" is earned through a decisive on-page choice. The final emotional state is a complex, resonant mixture of awe and terror, avoiding a simplistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions align perfectly with her profession as a linguist. However, her internal state is more described than embodied; the shift from academic to rescuer is asserted rather than dramatized through internal conflict. The "frantic beat of her own heart" is a rare moment of specific embodiment in an otherwise cerebral character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb. Elara’s motivation is singular and compelling, and her internal conflict—the "blissfully aberrant peace" of her fractured identity versus the desperate need to define her absorbed twin—is dramatized effectively through her actions. The final shift in her motivation, from recapturing to memorializing, is earned by the climactic revelation and lands with a palpable emotional cost, fulfilling the requirement for a meaningful, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are perfectly consistent with his established traits as a "warmly methodical" archivist. However, his characterization lacks meaningful internal conflict; he proceeds with untroubled competence from puzzle to solution. The absence of contradictory impulses or a moment of genuine struggle keeps the portrayal from feeling fully dimensional, even for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is singular and powerfully rendered. His character is revealed entirely through his precise, focused actions under duress, aligning perfectly with his role as a "mapkeeper." The concept of "hammered repose" is an excellent piece of characterization that pays off with the "true and earned repose" at the end, demonstrating a clear and earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is deeply integrated with his character, particularly his retrocognitive "curse." The internal conflict during the climax is masterful; his wavering resolve when faced with the "ancient, immense" loneliness feels earned and viscerally real. The final choice to place the shard demonstrates a clear hierarchy of values, sacrificing personal peace for a fragile, communal hope, satisfying the 9+ test for contradictory impulses resolved with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative from start to finish. The concept of "preemptive nostalgia" is a specific and powerful piece of interiority that is not just stated but demonstrated, particularly in his sharp grief for the truth he is about to lose. The final shift in his purpose—from archivist of fact to curator of a necessary myth—is a profound and earned change, demonstrating a complex character arc within a very short space.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation and worldview seamlessly integrated through his profession. The shift from chanting chemical formulas to colors is a subtle, powerful indicator of his changing methodology. His internal conflict between methodical hope and encroaching despair is embodied and palpable, particularly in the slump against the buttress, making his final, earned smile resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, her motivation a direct and compelling engine for the narrative. The story brilliantly fuses her profession—chronicling tidal pools—with her internal process, making her coping mechanism feel specific and earned, not like a generic epiphany. Her interiority is concrete, rooted in sensory observation rather than abstract emotional labels. The final choice is a direct result of her established worldview, demonstrating a rare and satisfying alignment of character, motivation, and action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The motivation to "collect the flavors of different silences" is both unique and psychologically resonant, driving every action. The internal conflict is embodied, not stated, particularly in the ascent where his "contracted muscles and spirit" fight the "terrifying openness." The final transformation is earned and shown through his changed perception of the doll, from "captive" to "pilgrim."

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear but overly articulated, bordering on a thematic statement ("His core motivation was simple: to teach silence how to comfort..."). This diagnostic self-awareness slightly flattens his interiority, making him feel more like a function of the theme than a complex individual. The passenger serves primarily as a receptive vessel for his lesson rather than a character with her own distinct pressures. While his actions are consistent, the lack of any internal contradiction or struggle makes the characterization feel a little too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and consistent, driving every action. Her defining trait, "wisely adventurous," is shown through her methodical, knowledge-based approach, which contrasts effectively with the failed attempts of her predecessors. However, her interiority reads as almost entirely competent; a moment of genuine doubt or fear as dawn approached would have deepened the characterization and heightened the feeling of a "calculated sally" into a true risk.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, though the phrasing "teach the suffocating how to breathe" borders on a thematic label. The character is defined by a single, powerful action, which is appropriate for this length. Liam's characterization is effective in its brevity, serving as a clean reflection of Elara's impact, but lacks complex interiority beyond the physical release.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted directly in her backstory with OmniVex. The internal conflict during the climax is perfectly dramatized as “the OmniVex pitch amplified to a cosmic scale,” directly testing her core wound. Her final, earned state of “breathing steady for the first time in years” provides a powerful and satisfying character closure, demonstrating a change earned through on-page struggle and a decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and powerful, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied specifics, such as feeling the hum "more in her bones than in her ears." The final change is not just an epiphany but a profound re-evaluation of her identity, earned through the physical and mental ritual. The cost is the loss of her lifelong quest, which is immediately replaced by a "novel lightness," making the resolution feel complete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is conceptually clear and drives the plot effectively, particularly in the whispered allegiance, "For the chance of what might be." The character is defined by his solemn duty, and his actions are consistent with that role. However, his interiority remains somewhat abstract; while we understand his purpose, we feel his "silent panic" and later "shivering bliss" more as descriptions of a state than as deeply embodied, contradictory experiences. The character serves the high-concept plot flawlessly but lacks a layer of specific, personal flaw or internal conflict beyond the immediate crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply integrated with the plot. The final emotional shift from personal sorrow to a shared sense of historical continuity is earned through specific, on-page micro-choices and discoveries. Her interiority is concrete and compelling, particularly the way her professional precision and personal grief merge. The final description of her emotional state as “tactfully hopeful” borders on a diagnostic label but is sufficiently earned by the preceding, embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established with depth and nuance in the first paragraph; she's not a generic hero but an archivist "holding the line against the tyranny of indifference." This motive is specific and credible, fueling her quiet but determined actions. Her interiority is well-embodied, with fear and resolve coexisting ("Her heart hammered against her ribs as she walked the causeway"). The final choice is an earned culmination of her established traits: underestimated, resourceful, and committed to preserving truth at great personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear, absolute, and rooted in a duty tinged with "eerie nostalgia." His interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in physical sensations ("dread clench in his stomach") and his actions—playing through negative space—are a perfect, character-specific expression of his goal to frame silence, not fill it. The final endurance is earned through this precise action, and the cost is legible in the "lonely vigil," fulfilling the requirements for an exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian's motivation is singular and powerfully clear, driving all on-page action from his meticulous sorting to the final, decisive prod. His interiority is conveyed through well-chosen, specific emotions like "mossy delight" and the physical reaction to the anomaly. While he lacks deep internal contradiction, for a short, fable-like piece, his role as a "tender of small things" is perfectly realized, and his transformation is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is driven by a clear and consistent philosophy, and his actions are well-motivated by this internal logic. The final shift from a need to solve to an ability to witness represents a significant, earned change. However, the characterization lacks a layer of internal contradiction during the active beats; he proceeds with a singular focus that, while consistent, feels slightly less complex than a top-tier characterization requires.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear and his internal conflict—balancing grief and joy—is dramatized effectively during the ritual's climax. The internal contradiction is active and embodied, not merely summarized. The final transformation of his emotional state is earned through on-page action and sacrifice, satisfying the 9+ test for a costed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas's characterization is strong, with a clear motivation and specific, embodied actions like using the crocodile's tooth. His internal state is conveyed effectively through phrases like "luminous ache." While his core motivation is powerful, its explicit statement ("His motivation was...") feels like an authorial intrusion rather than an organic part of his interiority, slightly flattening the discovery for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central paradox of being “displaced rooted” is masterfully embodied through Kaelen’s hyper-awareness of his own physiology set against his complete disorientation. The motivation shifts from survival to a profound conceptual quest, and this turn is earned by the story’s final revelation. The change in his grip on the pewter strap from “desperate” to “purposeful” is a perfect, subtle demonstration of his internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the first paragraph to the last. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in the opening description of intuition as an anchor. However, the character's competence is absolute; there is no moment of doubt, struggle, or a flaw that complicates the primary action, which keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Leo’s motivation (“to discover what ceilings hide”) is both unique and perfectly suited to the plot. The internal conflict is crystallized in a single, potent choice (“He could… pack his tools… Or he could engage”). The concept of a “weightless burden” is a sophisticated piece of interiority that colors the entire narrative without being overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Operator's motivation is exceptionally clear and philosophically grounded, driving the entire narrative. However, the character remains a cryptic figure—a functionary of the plot's grand concept—with interiority presented as unwavering purpose rather than embodied conflict. While this suits the mythic tone, the absence of any visible internal friction or contradictory impulse ("their face unreadable") prevents the characterization from reaching the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in his past as a "defunct revolutionary," creating a consistent throughline for his current intellectual battle. His interiority is specific and nuanced, contrasting his "burnished sorrow" with the intellectual fire reignited at the end. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through his poetic interpretation versus the cold data of his rival, a contradiction that acts in scene when he observes the shard. The final choice—to renew his fight—is earned by the climax and recontextualizes his entire character arc with a palpable cost of effort and potential failure ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is the story’s strongest asset. The climax hinges on a perfectly executed internal conflict, where Elias’s doubt is a tangible threat. His resolution—grounding himself in the humble, honest truth of his identity as a “music box repairman”—is an earned and powerful character choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The contradictory impulses of grandeur and humility act simultaneously in the climax, making his victory deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, driving every action from the inciting incident to the final renunciation. Her defining trait as a “petrichor collector” is not just a label but the engine of the plot and the source of the story’s final, felt cost. The change she undergoes—from collector to witness—is earned by the overwhelming experience in the cavern, and her final choice to leave the ultimate scent unbottled is a powerful and credible reversal of her life's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her established traits as an artist and learner. The transformation from artist to "custodian" is earned by the story's climax. However, her internal response to the mortal threat is slightly underdeveloped; the transition from a "heartbeat" of panic to "clarity" is too swift, missing an opportunity for more complex, embodied emotion under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, evolving from an obsession into an inheritance. Her interiority is concrete, and her actions (patient observation, returning with tools) directly reflect her "quietly driven" nature. The final realization feels earned, though a phrase like "a revelation she could feel in her bones" verges on stock phrasing, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining action—shifting his method of inquiry—is earned by the established context of his prolonged, isolated struggle. The interiority is concrete and avoids cliché, particularly the motivation for the tactical shift being “born from the quiet isolation of the zeppelin,” which links his external state to his internal breakthrough. The final change is not an epiphany but a hard-won strategic shift, making it highly credible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, rooted in his alchemical identity (“transformation, not surrender”). The internal conflict between despair and purpose is dramatized through his choice of a difficult, authentic method over “false comfort.” His exhaustion is embodied, providing a tangible cost to his actions. The final moment of resolve is earned and powerful, perfectly aligning his established traits with the immense choice he makes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elian’s motivation as an archivist is crystal clear and creates the story's central, tragic irony. The shift from professional duty to a horrified sense of responsibility is earned and powerful. The final paragraph presents a sharp internal conflict—"His oath was to the archive, but his duty was now to the people"—that is a direct, earned consequence of the preceding revelation, demonstrating contradictory impulses acting in the final beat with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state of “furiously tranquil” is a compelling anchor. However, her characterization serves the concept more than it reveals deep internal contradictions or flaws. She is a perfect instrument for the task, which slightly lessens the sense of personal struggle, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from his initial curiosity to the final, decisive choice. The interiority is concrete, effectively linking his doubt to a resonant certainty without resorting to abstraction. While the internal conflict is well-established, the final moments portray a steady resolve rather than a palpable, simultaneous struggle between contradictory impulses, which keeps it just shy of a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and directly drives the story's single, decisive action. The internal conflict between detached observation and a yearning for connection is embodied in his shift from tracing to empathizing. The final change is earned by a visceral, interior experience, avoiding the trap of a purely intellectual epiphany; the line “he traced its path not with the station’s mechanical arms, but with his own soul” is a perfect synthesis of his internal and external roles.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between preserving memory and acknowledging his failure is well-dramatized. The shift from "astonished recluse" to a man at peace is earned by the climax. While his decade of stasis resolves quickly, the interiority feels authentic, particularly the final, wordless exchange that embodies a profound change in his self-perception and his relationship with the past.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and embodied. The internal conflict between his fading vitality ("thinning of the light") and his poetic, patient quest is palpable. His final change is not an epiphany but an earned experience, a direct result of his unique methods. The characterization is flawless, with interiority that is concrete ("metallic wound") and perfectly aligned with his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his interiority is rendered with lyrical precision. His defining choice—to observe and process the child's grief rather than intervene—is a strong, character-revealing moment. However, the articulation of the theme in his thoughts ("about the startling grace of letting go...") feels slightly too polished and self-aware, bordering on an authorial summary rather than a raw, in-the-moment epiphany. This minor slip into thematic label-speak prevents an otherwise excellent portrayal from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent with his character. The interiority is well-drawn, particularly the contrast between his weakening body and defiant resolve. The final act of renunciation is earned and resonant, making for a powerful character arc within the brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization of Dr. Thorne is exceptional. His internal conflict between luminous skepticism and an undeniable emotional pull is dramatized with precision, not just stated. The shift from seeing the fly amber as a symbol of perfect stasis to a "cage" and finally to a "sacrifice" is a masterclass in tracking an internal arc through an object. His final choice feels both surprising and inevitable, an earned reconfiguration rather than a conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coachman's motivation is clear, potent, and perfectly aligned with his actions. He reads as a compelling archetype of atonement and duty, whose interiority is expressed through ritual rather than extensive reflection. While the characterization is effective for this lyrical piece, it lacks the sharp internal contradictions or visible flaws under pressure that would elevate it into the highest tier; he is defined by his purpose, not a struggle against it.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is established with emotional precision in the first paragraph and her actions flow from it with unwavering consistency. The internal conflict between disappointment and curiosity is beautifully externalized through her observation of Barrow, leading to a pivotal micro-choice to trust his senses over her own. The final shift from seeking the past to nurturing the future is an earned change, representing a credible evolution of her core drive with the felt cost of abandoning a lifelong dream for a new, uncertain responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her interiority is powerfully rendered through embodied sensations like being “temporally stretched.” The use of heirlooms provides concrete anchors for her internal conflict. The final change is earned by the preceding visionary experience, though the direct articulation of the epiphany (“Her confusion hadn't been a flaw; it was a higher state of awareness”) verges on diagnostic summary rather than purely embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is consistently expressed through action, particularly in the central choice to swap rather than steal. His philosophy of "cautious abandon" is well-dramatized in the climb and infiltration. The characterization is strong and purposeful, but lacks a deeper layer of internal conflict or contradiction; Kael operates from a place of serene conviction, which limits the potential for a more complex emotional arc within this brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the plot. Elara's motivation, born from the contradiction of her past as a crisis actor, is potent and specific, driving every choice. The climactic shift from performance to authentic sorrow is earned and powerful, serving as the story's lynchpin. The Regent, while brief, is effectively drawn, and her breaking point feels credible within the high-pressure moment Elara creates.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—the comfort of phantom worlds versus the painful need for a real home—is palpable. Her final change is earned through a specific, costly choice, renouncing the phantom worlds for the present. The embodiment of emotion, such as disappointment feeling like a "physical weight," is consistently strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the central flaw—pride demanding brilliance over safety—is expertly woven into the plot's resolution. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through the physical act of analyzing the tapestry and manipulating the labyrinth. The change from seeking a brilliant countermove to accepting a simple, correct one is earned and feels profound, foreclosing his path of self-aggrandizing pride with the felt cost of humility.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “refract” truth is established early and drives every action with compelling consistency. Her interiority is concrete, and the contradiction between her playful method and the cosmic stakes is well-dramatized. The final act of defiance is a perfect, earned culmination of her established character, foreclosing her freedom with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict—doubt versus a desperate need for meaning—is the story's engine. The contradiction between her perceived inadequacy ("a woman who spilled her tinctures") and the cosmic scale of her task creates potent tension. The final choice, a "surge born of love rather than skill," provides an earned and moving resolution to this internal struggle, demonstrating a change with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias's motivation is clear and his interiority is rendered with concrete, specific detail, such as his posture being a "study in being intimately aloof." The internal conflict between preserving a memory and releasing its burden is dramatized through his actions, culminating in a final, earned choice that feels both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias’s motivation is established with superb economy, rooted in a core conviction (“whispers travel farther than shouts”) and a specific personal history (the vial cork). The internal conflict between his quiet nature and the immense power of his intent is dramatized with visceral, embodied emotion (“an agony of love, a screaming tenderness”). The character’s change is one of validation, earned through a high-stakes choice with a clear spiritual cost, making the quiet final gesture deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is potent and clear, rooted in the loss of his daughter and sublimated into a broader purpose. His interiority is specific and avoids cliché, as seen in "a compass needle shivering inside him." The final emotional state of "raw solace" is earned through his on-page actions and acceptance of the cost—he cannot save his own daughter but provides a path for others, a poignant and credible conclusion to his internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from his reclusive lifestyle to the final ritual. His internal conflict between rationality and desperation is palpable. The score is held back slightly by the direct, almost diagnostic labeling of his goal as "to cultivate psychological safety," which feels less embodied than the rest of his portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas's character is clear and compelling, with a motivation that is both particular to him and universally resonant. His internal state is rendered with precision, especially the final shift from solitary observation to shared grief. The concept of "borrowed memories," while functional, is introduced with a slightly jarring, declarative label ("a phenomenon he called..."), which feels less organic than the story's otherwise seamless interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elias is strong, specific, and internally consistent. His motivation—a blend of love, grief, and duty to a promise—is clear and compelling. The story earns his final emotional shift; the renunciation of the "what-ifs" feels like a genuine, hard-won peace, not an unearned epiphany. The "empirically intuitive nature" is shown, not just told, by his patient execution of an absurd plan.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerful and clear, driving the narrative from the first sentence. Her internal conflict between disenchantment and duty is dramatized effectively, culminating in a final choice that is both surprising and inevitable. The transformation from seeking escape to embracing a grim guardianship is earned on the page with a palpable cost, satisfying the highest standards for character arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal conflict between intellectualism (the nautilus) and feeling is dramatized effectively. The epiphany is earned through the crucible of Kael's confession, making her final choice feel both surprising and inevitable. A minor deduction for the slight over-articulation of her realization ("The universe wasn't a pristine mathematical formula..."), which verges on diagnostic summary in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between the desire for narrative order and the "feral nostalgia" is both specific and embodied, particularly in phrases like "a longing so sharp and savage it felt like a physical hunger." The protagonist's contradictory impulses—envying his past while trying to chronicle it—act simultaneously. The final shift from a motivation of "triage" to one of "artistry" is earned by the climactic flight, marking a decisive and credible change with a clear felt cost (the loss of his foundational resentment).

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, rooted in a tangible loss that generates a new, credible form of perception. Her motivation to "unveil ordinary miracles" is earned through backstory and dramatized in a pivotal choice. The final shift to feeling the "weight of what remained" is a profound and earned change, demonstrating a complete and resonant arc.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core internal conflict between the disciplined rune scholar and the remembered folk wisdom is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The shift from seeing the quill as a pen for "established symbols" to a "simple stylus" for tracing is a powerful, earned micro-choice that reveals his entire change in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Julian's motivation is sharp and his internal conflict is embodied effectively, culminating in a change that feels earned, not declared. His final state—a lighter weight in his chest—is a credible, non-sentimental resolution. Madame Vex, though archetypal, provides perfect, targeted pressure that reveals Julian's values through his costly choice to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Witness's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks significant internal conflict. She functions more as a serene vessel for the story's concept than a character with contradictory impulses under pressure. While this fits the theme of ultimate resolution, the absence of a dramatized struggle against her purpose prevents the characterization from achieving flawless depth.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is established with elegant precision—not misanthropy, but a "consuming need to understand." This philosophical drive is earned and consistent, making his final shift from technician to witness feel both surprising and inevitable. His interiority is concrete and specific, with the discrepancy feeling like a "tectonic flaw." The brief reflection on his grandfather is perfectly cued by the key and charges the final image by reframing clocks as "membranes" rather than mere cages.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation is powerfully clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict is well-embodied in his actions, particularly the focus on creating a "door" instead of a "wall." The final emotional shift is earned; however, the explicit phrasing of his motive—"to finally understand the physics of letting go"—borders on thematic summary, slightly flattening the interiority that is otherwise shown with subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's core internal conflict—her structured, probabilistic worldview versus her father's chaotic intuition—is the story's engine. Her motivation is clear and her transformation is earned, culminating in a credible shift in perspective rather than a total personality change. The line establishing her as "only theoretically rebellious" provides the perfect psychological entry point for her undertaking this illogical quest.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.5)
    Silas’s motivation is singular and powerfully executed, creating a character who is more of a function or a force than a traditional protagonist, which serves the story’s concept perfectly. The stasis of his character—"a catalyst who remained unchanged"—is not a flaw but the earned, resonant core of his existence. His interiority is conveyed through his precise, deliberate actions rather than exposition, and his cultivated estrangement feels like a tangible, costly choice. The characterization is flawless in its commitment to its own unusual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is concrete, especially the final, complex feeling of “haunted euphoria,” which is earned rather than merely stated. While Tomas serves more as a receptive counterpart, his awe-struck reaction validates the stakes and feels authentic within the brief interaction. The characterization is strong, showing Elara's values through her patient, meticulous actions.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Silas's motivation is deeply rooted in his "profound loneliness," which is powerfully contrasted with his professional competence. The internal conflict is clear—the desire for a magical fix (the moon rock) versus the need for genuine, messy connection. His final choice to withhold the rock and offer practical help is a perfectly earned change, demonstrating a shift from isolated hope to active participation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kaelen's motivation, rooted in grief for Elara, is clear and potent. His unique sensory experience is not just a trait but the lens for his entire interiority, rendering his struggle with the "deafening orchestra" visceral. The final change—accepting harmony over silence—is an earned, nuanced resolution to his internal conflict, making the mapping of the forest a perfect metaphor for mapping his own heart.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is stark and all-consuming, and his internal conflict between the desire to erase his past and the need to integrate it is dramatized effectively. The character arc from being "hunched over the console in a knot of guilt" to the deliberate act of unbending is an excellent example of embodied emotion driving the resolution. The final choice feels earned, foreclosing the path of revision with the felt cost of permanent loss, which he accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian's motivation is singular and powerfully executed, with his interiority ("joyful sorrow") directly tied to his artistic purpose. The memory of Lyra functions as an effective internal guide, providing pressure and direction without feeling like a clumsy expositional device. While his internal conflict is more a focused resolve than a struggle between contradictory impulses, his deliberate actions and the final emotional synthesis feel earned and resonant for the story's lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with a compelling internal contradiction between the protagonist's analytical mind and his "volcanic" grief. The shift from destructive rage to creative purpose is well-earned and emotionally resonant. The final paragraph slightly over-articulates his new mission statement, a minor slip that keeps it from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and deeply felt, driving the entire narrative arc from quiet rebellion to a profound creative act. Her interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity, avoiding cliché through metaphors like grief being "braided into her marrow." The character’s final emotional state—a fusion of triumphant creation and devastating loss—is earned through the scene's progression, culminating in a powerful image of Earned Stasis that is both beautiful and heartbreaking.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas is a well-realized character whose motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. His quiet competence is effectively contrasted with Kaelen’s hollow arrogance. However, his success feels preordained; he never faces a moment of genuine doubt or a setback that forces adaptation, which keeps the characterization just shy of exceptional. The "calculated spontaneity" of the coin flip is a clever character beat, but not a true struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen is more of an archetypal function than a fully-realized character, defined by a single, unwavering purpose. While motivation is clear, the lack of any internal contradiction or meaningful struggle against their own "spiralingly calm" nature renders them somewhat flat. The empathy is stated ("a cold ache") rather than deeply embodied in a way that shows cost or vulnerability. The characterization is consistent and serves the story's purpose, but it lacks the compelling flaws or internal friction expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his interiority is well-rendered through his unique attribute. The character is compelling, and the final shift in his perception from broadcasting hope to receiving curiosity is earned. The "chess coach" identity provides a nice closing metaphor ("a pawn bravely advanced") but feels slightly under-integrated into his moment-to-moment tactics, which keeps this just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively externalized through his conflict with Elara. Their relationship serves as a strong crucible, and her "combative tenderness" provides a believable mix of opposition and love. The primary weakness is Kaelen's explicit articulation of his motive—"To find freedom in embracing one's true nature..."—which feels more like a thematic summary than authentic dialogue, slightly undercutting the character's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between survivalist performance and guilt-ridden grief is dramatized through the contrast between the narrated tea ritual and the silent whittling. The question, “Was this lightness for him, or a penance for her?” provides a sharp, morally complex core. The final earned stasis feels authentic, a testament to a character who is deeply realized through his micro-choices under immense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and character-particular; being a “cloud-shadow poet” provides a specific, aesthetic lens that justifies his unique approach. The internal conflict between the structured self and the need for dissolution is well-embodied through physical sensations like the “feeling in the teeth.” The final change is earned through this process, culminating in a credible renunciation of his old incomprehension with the felt cost of ego-dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian's motivation, rooted in his unique perception, is clear, consistent, and drives the central innovation of the plot. His interiority is specific and embodied, making his final realization feel earned. The collaboration with Vex reveals character through action under immense pressure, resulting in a compelling dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his defining trait of “powerfully gentle strength” is demonstrated through his patient, methodical actions rather than just stated. While the interiority is present, the conflict is more of an external puzzle against a mystery than a deep, contradictory internal struggle. The final change is a profound conceptual shift, which is well-earned, but the character arc itself remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but the initial impulse to help feels slightly abrupt and is stated too plainly ("teach withering to bloom again"). The woman serves more as a mirror for his grief than a fully realized character until the final lines, which somewhat flattens the emotional stakes of their interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptional: a fusion of inherited intellectual obsession and a desire for systemic understanding. The shift from detached analyst to inheritor of a legacy is earned by her choice to confide in Julian, revealing a profound internal landscape. The characterization is flawless, with her methods and tools serving as direct extensions of her worldview and personal history, fulfilling the 9+ test with a clear cost felt in the final, weighted silence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a clear motivation (forbidden knowledge) and a core trait (unpredictability) that is not merely stated but becomes the central mechanic of the plot. The internal conflict between academic curiosity and the terrifying, personal cost is beautifully rendered. The final transformation into a "shimmering composite" is an earned and costly change, powerfully capturing the story's emotional and thematic weight in a single image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply felt, driving a central choice—integration over deletion—that feels both surprising and inevitable. His interiority is conveyed with concrete, poignant details, such as the love that "outlived its object" and the final "luminous regret." The character's core trait as a "dusk noticer" is not just a label; it is the engine of the plot, enabling the discovery that systemic checks miss and leading to a resolution rooted in profound empathy rather than technical prowess.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a potent internal conflict between cynicism and compassion. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into overly diagnostic self-awareness, particularly the resolution. Phrases like "He had to find a way to balance the two" and the concluding realization read more like a tidy summary of the psychological arc than an embodied, in-the-moment experience, slightly flattening the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.4)
    The character's motivation to find "perfect closure" is sharp and creates a compelling internal contradiction that pays off beautifully. Elias’s interiority is rendered with specific, memorable language ("returning geography," "psychic soil and rock") that avoids cliché. The final shift from closure-seeker to archivist is an earned renunciation, with the cost of abandoning hope for peace made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is both unique and deeply felt, providing a powerful engine for a quiet story. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific details, particularly the shift into Arthur's perspective ("the texture of a wooden desk beneath her phantom elbows"). The final change is an earned epiphany rather than a choice, which fits the story's contemplative mode, and the cost is the acceptance of a beautiful, melancholic truth.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, and her internal conflict between the "crushing static" and the desire for creative peace is palpable. The transformation is profound but earned within the story's lyrical logic, culminating in a final action—sketching the faces—that perfectly demonstrates her new state of being without summarizing it. The arc from tormented soul to cosmic artist is complete and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation—to cultivate, not erase—is clear and consistent, compelling the central choice to synthesize rather than destroy. The character's core contradiction is being a 'dreamless' guardian of possibilities, a state which is credibly challenged and shifted by the story's events. The final internal change to feeling 'the beginning of a dream' is earned through the preceding struggle and action, providing a resonant and earned arc with a clear felt cost—the permanent alteration of the past into something new.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "chart the cartography of his own soul" is clear and consistent. The interiority is specific, particularly the embodied "hum of insight." However, the final epiphany, while well-described, feels slightly frictionless; the shift from confusion to profound understanding happens in a moment of passive reception rather than a more dramatized internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is established cleanly, but her final realization feels overly articulated and diagnostic. The lines, "Elara finally understood. The unused courage she sought wasn't hidden... It was not an object to be found, but a muscle to be flexed..." reads more like an authorial summary than an earned, embodied epiphany, slightly flattening the character's internal journey at its peak.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in past failure. The internal conflict between the desire for safety and the need for atonement is dramatized with concrete, embodied emotion, particularly in the line "the phantom tingle of his regenerating nerves felt like a constant, low-voltage accusation." The final, earned choice to act demonstrates a significant and believable character shift.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation for balance is clear and consistent, and his weariness is well-conveyed. His actions are deliberate and align perfectly with his established nature. The characterization is strong and specific, but it lacks a moment of dramatized internal conflict or a contradictory impulse in-scene; he is a figure of pure, unwavering purpose, which makes him compelling but slightly less complex than a top-tier characterization would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a grief that is both personal (Lena) and ecological (the reef). His interiority is conveyed through potent, specific metaphors like being "moored" while his thoughts "drifted." The final shift from aimless obsession to purposeful endurance is earned by the climactic revelation, representing a credible change that forecloses the path of escape for one of purposeful waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her initial contradictory state of being "awkwardly confident" is a strong starting point. However, her awkwardness dissolves too easily, and the central action proceeds without any significant internal or external struggle. The character arc is one of pure competence, which slightly lessens the tension and makes her feel more like a function of the plot than a person facing a difficult test.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully articulated and consistent, providing a clear engine for the narrative. However, the characterization leans heavily on stated beliefs ("Elara believed predictability was just another name for stagnation") rather than dramatizing a moment of internal conflict or doubt within the scene itself. While her competence is compelling, a flicker of contradictory impulse on the page would have elevated the character from a focused agent of theme to a more complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict is dramatized with visceral, embodied emotion ("a familiar ice bloomed in her stomach"), avoiding diagnostic labels. The contradictory impulses—paralysis from memory versus the conscious will to ground herself in the present—are shown acting simultaneously. The final act of endurance is earned with a clear physical and emotional cost, making her a complex and believable individual.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's motivation is potent and his internal conflict is embodied with visceral specificity in the "luminescent ache." The transformation from a crestfallen artist who sees fragments to a cartographer who charts them is earned through the central on-page action, representing a profound and credible psychological shift. The contradictory impulses—the urge to succumb versus the need to create order—are resolved in a way that accepts brokenness rather than erasing it, a sophisticated choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation is intensely focused and his actions are consistent with his stated "colder" purpose. The core contradiction—ignoring the immediate communal crisis for his abstract hunt—is well-established. The brief backstory block, while slightly expository ("This was the mystery that drove him..."), effectively grounds his present choices, narrowly avoiding a penalty by directly fueling the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, with her internal conflict dramatized through embodied reactions like "a wave of vertigo" rather than mere summary. The motivation is clear and compelling, escalating from professional duty to a moral imperative against the backdrop of the "purity purge." The line "before the instinct for self-preservation could cauterize her courage" is a superb moment of interiority that earns her high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent internal conflict that is embodied through action rather than summarized. The contrast between her nurturing hands and the memory of her father's on the knife's hilt provides a powerful, concrete crucible for her values. The final choice is an Earned Stasis, a renunciation that feels both inevitable and hard-won, solidifying a complex and believable protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is singular and potent, driving every action. His interiority is well-realized, particularly the climactic moment where he becomes an "antenna for sorrow," a specific and embodied experience rather than a declared feeling. His unique attribute and cool-headedness are demonstrated, not just stated, making his competence credible within the fantastical context.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Celeste's motivation is sharp and consistent, moving from the specific observations of her father's "satellites of sorrow" to a decisive final action. Her interiority is concrete and drives the plot. However, the execution of her plan is almost too perfect; she exhibits no self-doubt or contradictory impulses in the climactic scene, which makes her feel more like a flawless instrument of the plot than a person under immense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and viscerally rendered as a "low-frequency hum," providing a powerful engine for the narrative. Interiority is specific and evocative, particularly the way Elian's professional lens (seeing circuitry as star-charts) informs his climactic action. The final earned change from hiding a scar to displaying a memorial is compelling. The character's skillset aligns almost too perfectly with the esoteric problem, bordering on contrivance, which slightly tempers an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is immediately clear and compelling. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic detail ("felt the silence not as peace, but as a gathering tension"). Her defining trait as an artist who prefers "whimsy to despair" directly informs her final, decisive action, making the choice to create the mandala feel inevitable and earned. The link between her social perception and her chosen artistic method is particularly strong and avoids any sense of contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized through his contradictory nature—a gentle touch delivering a brutal, identity-destroying mercy. The internal conflict is embodied in the cost of his work, "the echoes of all the minds he had touched," preventing his empathy from feeling cheap. The final choice is a perfect culmination of his established philosophy, with the cost felt in the "hollow ache" he experiences, meeting the 9+ test for earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Julian's motivation as an artist seeking a final, redemptive "encore" is perfectly established and executed. His actions are driven by a consistent, character-specific blend of nostalgia and artistic impulse. While Elara is more of an object for his performance, this serves the single-POV structure well, making her change feel both external and deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias’s internal conflict between his affectionate love and his core skepticism is dramatized with exceptional nuance. His motivation shifts from a gentle desire to appease Lena to a genuine hope of finding a new language, a change earned through the events of the story. The final micro-choice—intertwining his fingers and feeling her pulse as a "somatic marker"—is a perfect, embodied culmination of his arc, showing his acceptance of a new kind of proof. The contradictory impulses are held in tension throughout and resolve with a palpable, earned cost to his old worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and her actions are consistent. However, the final paragraph shifts from embodied experience to a slightly summary-like statement of her new reality ("Her quest was no longer an abstract motivation; it was a tangible reality..."). This slightly undercuts the earned interiority of the climactic moment by labeling the outcome instead of letting it resonate purely through image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear, specific, and drives the entire narrative without deviation. His internal conflict between prescribed duty and personal conviction is established early and resolved through his actions. The final choice feels earned, a direct result of his painstaking work, fulfilling the 9+ quick test for causality and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is sharp, consistent, and credibly propels the narrative. The internal conflict between his past failure and the need for redemption is embodied in his handling of the pillbox. The final shift from a man haunted by the past to one with a forward-looking purpose is earned, though the realization "This was it, the place his courage had been hiding" borders on diagnostic summary, slightly softening an otherwise excellent portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elias is exceptional. His interiority is rendered with concrete, non-clichéd imagery (e.g., memory as "bubbles in slow-boiling tar"). His central motivation—to "distill complexity into essence"—is not just stated but fully dramatized, providing a clear engine for the internal plot. The final change, the loosening of the knot of his promise, is earned by the preceding reflection and feels like a credible, profound shift rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistently driven by his "zen-minded" nature. The character serves as an effective, if somewhat passive, vessel for the story's thematic exploration. The characterization is strong, but it lacks the internal contradiction or struggle between competing impulses that would elevate it to the highest tier; his path feels more like a serene discovery than a choice made under crucible-like pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and earned through the backstory of her locksmith father. The internal state of "wistfully pragmatic" is not just stated but perfectly dramatized in her choice to act. The character's creed, "to reflect light into dark corners," is beautifully embodied in a single, sustained action, and her final "tired smile" conveys the cost and reward of her "protected vulnerability" with masterful subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Kael’s motivation to alchemize isolation into independence is clear and potent, driving the narrative’s single, decisive action. The internal conflict between the beauty and pain of his memories is embodied with specific, non-clichéd sensory detail, and the final shift to an earned stasis feels entirely credible, avoiding a simplistic resolution in favor of a profound reconfiguration of his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is rendered with exceptional clarity and depth. The tension between hoarding her symbol of connection and sacrificing it for actual connection is palpable and contradictory impulses—"kinship and terror"—are dramatized in the moment. The final choice feels both inevitable and hard-won, a perfectly earned culmination of her established motivations.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is fierce and clear, and her interiority skillfully balances professional competence with personal dread and hope. The story avoids cliché by embodying her conflict not in dialogue, but in her relationship with her tools and the signals she interprets. The final choice is earned, and the cost—exhaustion and the burden of a continued, lonely fight—is felt in the story’s final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core internal conflict—an explorer with claustrophobia—is not just stated but embodied through concrete physical sensations and choices under pressure. The contradiction between his prudent nature and the immense risk he undertakes is compelling, and his final action is a credible culmination of his desperate clarity, fully earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb and deeply integrated with the premise. Elias's motivation—to awaken empathy starved by prosopagnosia—is both unique and compelling, driving every action in the scene. His internal conflict is powerfully embodied in his methodical artistic process, a structured attempt to grasp an unstructured feeling. The final, earned emotional breakthrough is a quiet, aching sorrow, a far more honest and impactful resolution than a simple epiphany would have been.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation is crystalline and compelling, driving the plot from the first paragraph. The internal conflict is perfectly captured in the recurring "nervously confident" state, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift to "clean, bright fire of confidence" is an earned change, representing a compelling emotional arc that resolves with the external plot.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and well-earned. The shift from a man defined by “longing and loss” to one pursuing an “impossible hope” is catalyzed directly by the on-page events. His interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in the moment his lifelong motivation surges “into a powerful crescendo.” The final action—playing a new, strange song—is a perfect, character-specific expression of his newfound resolve, demonstrating a choice with the felt cost of abandoning his old artistic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the potent internal conflict of his father's legacy. His choice to use subtle psychological tactics instead of violence is a direct and compelling outgrowth of this core struggle. The characterization is strong, particularly the contrast between his polished calm and the violent potential of his bloodline, but the final epiphany, while earned, is articulated with a slightly too-perfect diagnostic clarity, softening the impact of an otherwise flawless character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a multi-generational obsession that gives his weariness immediate weight. The character's shift from frustrated decoder to empathetic witness is earned through the central dream sequence. Interiority is strong, though the final paragraph borders on self-aware summary ("he was using his gift... to give peace to a memory"), which slightly undermines the otherwise embodied resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular and powerfully rendered. Her "warlike serenity" is an excellent, character-particular trait that is tested and ultimately broken in the climax, leading to an earned emotional shift. The internal state is clear and consistent, avoiding diagnostic labels in the peak moments of struggle. The transformation from a guarded "fortress" to someone capable of weeping feels credible and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is the story's spine, and her core conflict—being physically trapped but psychically powerful—is embodied perfectly. The contradictory "anxious elation" is earned and felt throughout, culminating in a choice to create rather than find, which feels like a genuine, earned evolution of her character's approach, even at this short length. The cost of her power is made visceral in the opening line, grounding the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear, and his defining traits ("reckless idealist," "fiercely gentle") directly inform his on-page choices. The internal conflict between panic and resolve during the climax is embodied and resolved through a micro-choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The final act of renouncing the memory is a perfectly earned change, paid for with a tangible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb and deeply integrated. The central contradiction between the detached appraiser and the haunted roadie is dramatized through specific, embodied actions, not just stated. The motivation is clear and compelling, and the final micro-choice—placing the cloth on the desk—is a powerful, earned gesture that resolves the internal conflict with quiet authenticity. The character's state of being "confidently uncertain" is a masterful summary of his complex interiority, which the story successfully unpacks.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear and potent motivation that evolves organically from grief to inquiry. Her interiority is specific and sophisticated, avoiding cliché; the shift from ambition feeling like “hollow ghosts” to being “illuminated” is earned through on-page intellectual and emotional labor. The contradictory impulses of deep sorrow and unwavering belief in an ordered universe are held in a tense, believable balance, culminating in a choice that credibly reconfigures her entire worldview with palpable cost and gain.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is conceptual but effective; the central conflict is not a choice against a flaw, but an embodiment of necessary contradictions (Archivist/Smelter). The motivation is clear and the emotional cost of the final action is embodied on the page ("accepted the searing pain"). The cyclical nature of the character prevents a traditional arc, but the execution of this "migration of selfhood" is confident and internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is established early and provides a powerful internal conflict against his professional duty. The characterization is elevated by the pivotal moment of internal struggle—"the heartbeat of a hesitation"—which is not merely summarized but dramatized, making his final, costly choice feel earned. The contradiction between his oath and his core belief acts directly in the scene, fulfilling the demands of high-level character work.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is very strong, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in grief. Elias’s interiority is concrete and well-embodied, particularly in the opening ("sandpaper against his nerves"). The final shift is earned, but the concluding self-analysis—"He was the one who drew the lines between the accident and his worth"—is slightly too articulate, bordering on diagnostic summary rather than a raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb for this scope, establishing a clear and desperate motivation that drives every action. Interiority is rendered through evocative, embodied phrases like "cautious exuberance that was almost painful," perfectly capturing a contradictory state without cliché. Her competence is balanced by the clear struggle of the task, making her final success feel earned. The final stance—turning to face the dawn—is a powerful, earned change rooted in the causality of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's central contradiction—a cynical functionary with a secret, truth-seeking core—is established with immediate economy through the "mulberry ache." His motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, leading to an earned, costly choice. The final reconfiguration of his ache into a "fertile pang" is a masterful touch, showing change rather than just stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She is presented as a flawless artisan performing a sacred duty without struggle, doubt, or contradictory impulse. While her competence is well-dramatized, this unwavering serenity makes her feel more like a function of the story's concept than a complex individual, limiting the score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between passive observation and active intervention is well-drawn. The link between forgiving her brother and her climactic choice provides a solid foundation for her change. However, the final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness ("Contentment, she finally understood...") rather than a purely embodied realization, which tempers an otherwise very strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's motivation ("to welcome nuance into certainty") is clear and demonstrated through action, not just stated. Kaelen's internal conflict is embodied perfectly in the "subtle tremor in his hand," and his final, wordless decision is earned through a sequence of mounting psychological pressure. The narrator's voice, particularly the self-awareness of being "sincerely insincere," provides a compelling and distinct lens for the story.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear, embodied in his impatience, and his internal conflict between wanting and needing to let go is well-dramatized. Elara is also well-drawn, with her core motivation efficiently established. The final change in Kael is earned through the scene's struggle, making his concluding "I see" feel significant and foreclosing his previous, frantic state with a visible cost—the release of his desperate anchoring desire.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kaelan’s motivation is established with poetic precision and remains the story's anchor. The character’s internal state is conveyed through embodied perception rather than labels, and their core trait of reverence directly shapes the plot by constraining their initial actions. The final change is a subtle but profound shift from a seeker to a guide, an evolution earned entirely by the preceding events and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb for this length. Kael's motivation is clear, and his core conflict—being a "poet forced to write legal code"—is embodied in his actions. The climax, where he sheds his pack, is a powerful physical manifestation of an internal choice, and the resulting change is earned and resonant, fulfilling the story's initial promise with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Silas’s motivation is clear, profound, and dramatized through his actions. The internal conflict is rendered beautifully through the contradiction of his public duty versus his private pilgrimage, and his attempt to reduce the immense emotional task to mere physics is a masterful touch of character-specific self-deception that makes his final surrender to memory all the more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kael’s motivation to “wavelength align with purpose” is esoteric yet grounded in his concrete actions and internal conflict. The struggle between being a “prophet” or a “madman” provides a compelling internal stake that is credibly resolved. The final shift from “quietly enthusiastic” to profound awe is earned by the story’s events, representing a perfect, cost-aware character closure where his original goal is lost but a greater one is found.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply felt, rooted in a specific, potent grief. The interiority is rendered with concrete, non-generic language, such as grief being a "physical amputation" and the need to "map the vast and monstrous geography of his own sorrow." The final act is a direct and earned consequence of this internal state, making the character arc both satisfying and credible within the story's logic. A minor limitation is the lack of demonstrated internal contradiction *in the present scene*; his resolve is unwavering once the idea is sparked.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s characterization is exceptional, defined by the potent contradiction between his weak power (“lukewarm mage”) and his immense ambition. His internal conflict between “brittle devotion” and “crushing futility” is embodied in his patient, repetitive actions. The final weary, hopeful smile is perfectly earned by the preceding struggle, a quiet culmination that feels true to the character established from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and compelling, escalating naturally from curiosity to a focused sense of purpose. The internal conflict between honoring his grandfather's memory and correcting the historical record is well-managed. The climactic choice feels earned, though the epiphany moment ("Elias now understood his own purpose...") is slightly over-articulated, bordering on diagnostic summary rather than a purely embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to harmonize logic and intuition is clear and consistently drives the narrative. The internal conflict is well-dramatized, particularly his choice to abandon his meticulous methods for a "whimsical" one. The reveal of the locket provides a strong, concrete anchor for his "secretly sentimental" nature, making his final realization feel earned rather than sudden. A slight weakness is that some interiority verges on diagnostic self-awareness, like being "trapped in the precise cage of his own intellect," which slightly abstracts the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Kael’s motivation—preserving trust—is established early and tested under pressure. The internal conflict between his duty and his body’s betrayal (the tremor) is powerfully embodied, and the resolution via the parachute buckle feels earned and specific, showing a complex history without exposition. The contradictory impulses of fear and duty act simultaneously in the climax, making his eventual success resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation—a quiet, desperate curiosity to feel again—is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between the memory of feeling and the reality of numbness is not just stated but weaponized in the climax. Jin provides a concise and effective external pressure, and the final shift from numbness to a "terrifying sense of responsibility" is a perfectly earned and complex character change.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific to his profession as a puzzle-maker, driving a logical and compelling internal journey. The shift from an analytical impulse to solve the sender's identity to the creative impulse to nurture the puzzle itself represents a well-earned character change. The internal conflict is subtle but effective, pitting his problem-solving skills against a mystery that demands participation over decryption. His final choice is a direct result of this internal progression, with the cost being a long-term, patient commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.6)
    The character's central contradiction, "mournfully eager," is brilliantly realized through action. His motivation is both clear and agonizing, and his helplessness is made palpable in the struggle with the pull cord. The internal conflict—a desperate love expressed through a violent, chaotic act—is sustained perfectly from concept to closure, making his final sliver of peace feel deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lyel’s motivation is powerful and consistent, rooted in the compelling concept of "dimensionally homesick." The internal conflict between his feral nature and his "forgotten softness" is expertly dramatized in the climax. The final choice to protect the library feels earned, a direct consequence of the established trait of "interiorizing exteriors," making his final shift in perspective deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, particularly the dramatization of the "stoically sensitive" attribute. The contradiction between Elias's resigned exterior and his internal "frantic sensitivity" that "flinched" with each failure is shown, not told. This internal conflict makes his final, earned breakthrough from forceful command to quiet surrender feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is both abstract and concrete, driving the entire narrative. Her shift from despair to "defiant practicality" is a compelling internal turn, motivated by her mentor's lesson. The choices she makes are a direct result of her professional expertise and her unique worldview, making the final success feel deeply earned. The characterization is exceptional, with her internal state and external actions in perfect alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Finn's character is consistent and his actions align with his "resiliently positive" nature, which is demonstrated rather than just labeled. The final change to his worldview is earned by his actions. However, the pivotal moment of understanding feels more like a necessary plot device than a fully rendered internal process, slightly flattening his interiority at that key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is singular, clear, and serves as the story's engine. His defining trait of "unsettling calm" is masterfully established and then chillingly reprised at the end, deepened by "profound hollowness," demonstrating a powerful, earned character change. The internal conflict is perfectly dramatized through the tangible act of weaving the altered memory, making a conceptual struggle feel visceral and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly tied to his profession, making his obsession feel like an inevitable calling rather than a whim. The interiority is specific and insightful, particularly the sorrow he feels for his world's former smallness, which avoids a simple "new frontiers" triumphalism. The final choice he presents is earned through his methodical work, fulfilling the promise of his "balancedly curious" nature with a powerful, costly vision.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, functioning as an effective narrative engine. However, his interiority is thin; he is more of a calm, competent functionary than a character with internal contradictions or vulnerabilities. The defining trait of "persistently curious" is stated but not meaningfully tested on the page, making his success feel smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is powerfully established and his internal conflict—claustrophobia versus duty—is embodied with visceral, specific details (“tightness gripped Elias’s chest, the cold sweat”). The final change, feeling “blessedly open,” is earned through his courageous actions, providing a deeply satisfying resolution to his internal arc that is perfectly scaled to the story’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply integrated with her core contradiction—being legally dead while physically alive. Her internal state is rendered with specificity, particularly through the recurring, embodied action of counting her pulse. This action masterfully tracks her arc, shifting from a “quiet rebellion” to a “quiet, constant hum,” earning the story’s final emotional state with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and deeply integrated with his unique perceptual abilities. The internal conflict between his elders' beliefs and his own theory is resolved through decisive action, not just reflection. The final shift from a "storyteller with no stories" to having the "first line of a new one" provides a powerful, earned change that resonates with the initial setup, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a visible cost paid in years of solitary effort.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is intensely clear and his internal journey from vengeful bitterness to a complex, weary acceptance is masterfully executed. The change is catalyzed by a single, worldview-shattering event, making the rapid and profound shift feel earned. The line "My long-held bitterness... suddenly felt profoundly, cosmically stupid" is a moment of perfect, character-specific insight that lands with immense force.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the central action. The internal state, particularly the "nervous flutter" she embraces rather than fights, is a strong, embodied choice that fuels the climax. The final emotional state of "exhaustion and elation" is earned, though the epiphany in the last line verges on thematic summary rather than purely embodied feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with poetic precision—"to find where broken promises heal"—and is beautifully resolved in the final conceptual shift from finding a place to building one. The interiority is concrete and consistent, conveyed through phrases like "quiet ache" and "solemnity of a sacrament," which align perfectly with his meticulous, principled actions. A higher score is gated only by the absence of a more complex internal contradiction acting *in the moment* of the climax; his resolve is absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his retreat from a "too loud" world. His interiority is conveyed through his patient, focused actions rather than overt summary. The core conflict between his embrace of silence and his creative impulse is beautifully resolved in the final act, where singing becomes an act of creation that sanctifies, rather than destroys, the quiet. The change is earned, profound, and forecloses his path of pure, unvoiced silence with a palpable cost and gain.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait of “sanely eccentric” is dramatized effectively through his meticulous, esoteric actions. The characterization is strong and consistent, culminating in an earned internal shift from belief to confirmed knowledge. However, the story depicts a state of absolute focus rather than dramatizing a significant internal conflict with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas's motivation is singular and powerfully sustained, driving every action in this brief, focused narrative. The interiority is rendered with poetic precision, particularly the concept of a "luminous absence that hollowed out his days." While the character arc is a straightforward fulfillment rather than a complex internal struggle, its execution is clean, and the final state of contentment is earned by the preceding obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Locksmith's motivation is philosophically clear and consistent, driving his singular focus. The mother’s grief provides a strong emotional anchor. However, the Locksmith himself lacks any meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page; he is a flawless instrument of his purpose, which makes him more of an archetypal force than a complex character, slightly limiting the score in this highly competitive context.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and provides the engine for the entire narrative. The internal conflict between a lifetime of academic caution and the overwhelming pull of nostalgia is dramatized perfectly in the climactic choice to touch the mushroom. This action is not just a plot point but a profound character turn, earned by the established traits of obsession and "chronic curiosity."

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Kael's internal conflict is masterfully shown through his contradictory actions: his sharp, combative teaching versus the nervous retreat of walking backwards. Elara's arc from flinching student to a person who understands a deeper form of resilience is earned and demonstrated in her final, decisive action of restacking the scrolls, a perfect embodiment of her new motivation. The "combative tenderness" is not just stated but lived out in their interaction, making their relationship feel crucible-like and authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his lineage and purpose. However, his characterization is one of pure, flawless competence. The story lacks a moment of internal conflict, doubt, or a trade-off born from a personal flaw; his creativity is presented as an unalloyed good. The line "A lesser guardian might have simply planted it" establishes his unique skill but also keeps him at a distance, making him more of a mythic functionary than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's voice is assured and weary, establishing a mentor dynamic that feels earned rather than stated. Kaelen's transition from fearful observer to participant is dramatized effectively through the story's single action, culminating in the final, weighted gesture of taking the needle. The metaphor of the mask-restorer beautifully deepens the narrator's motivation without slowing the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to "interpret silence with empathy" is a sophisticated driver that is fully earned by the story's conclusion. The final choice to annotate rather than repair the map demonstrates a profound, earned change, fulfilling the contradictory impulses between her professional duty to restore and her personal need to understand. A minor deduction for the slightly declarative phrasing of her motivation and core traits, which could have been conveyed with even more subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and consistent, but their character serves more as an elegant lens for the central concept than a complex individual. The introduction of "Mortimer" is an intriguing, understated way to personify the narrator's relationship with mortality. However, the final emotional shift feels slightly too swift and intellectually neat; the "long-held griefs" are resolved by a concept rather than a dramatized internal struggle, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elian’s motivation is deeply rooted and his interiority is conveyed through embodied emotion, moving from “driftingly alert calm” to the palpable “familiar sorrow of failure” before the climax. The final choice to draw the bolt plate glyph is a perfect, earned culmination of his internal state and goals, satisfying the need for a meaningful act with visible cost in the acceptance of the connection's fleeting nature.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear, stemming from loyalty and a specific, character-driven curiosity ("warmly inquisitive"). The internal conflict between duty and feeling like an "intruder" is present and adds a necessary layer of texture. The final shift to "affectionate detachment" is an earned change, representing a mature acceptance of his role as guardian of a secret, which lands with a felt cost of silent responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the premise. Elias’s motivation—to find proof that "empty spaces remember"—is a powerful, rarefied objective that feels earned by his grief and profession. His internal state is rendered with concrete, specific details, and the shift from "castaway" to "curator" represents a profound, earned change, foreclosing the path of despair at the cost of accepting his own end. The contradiction between his scientific methodology and his romantic, mystical goal creates a compelling internal dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining limitation—face blindness—is ingeniously transformed into the core strength required to solve the story's central puzzle. This synthesis of flaw and function is seamless. The interiority is concrete and specific, particularly the line about seeing subjects as "the pattern of their anxieties," which establishes a unique perceptual signature that pays off in her method of reading the coin.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his defining trait—diligently curious—is perfectly dramatized, driving the central discovery. The internal arc from "sociable isolation" to "profound communion" provides a satisfying emotional closure that mirrors the plot's conceptual repricing. While the emotional interiority is conveyed effectively, a slightly more embodied sense of his frustration or awe, rather than the well-phrased labels, could have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation—the quiet obsession "to learn the rhythm of repair"—is both the story's engine and its thematic core. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, non-clichéd texture ("a feeling like water-smoothed wood held in the hand"). The final choice is a direct, earned culmination of her unique lineage and skills, and the change in her internal state is sophisticated, integrating past ache with present fulfillment rather than erasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    The characters are functional archetypes—Elara the faithful leader, Kaelen the cynic—whose motivations are clear but lack deep interior contradiction. Their roles serve the plot's needs efficiently, and the "found family" dynamic is demonstrated in the climax. However, their internal conflicts are resolved too cleanly, and their interactions lack the friction that would make their bond feel truly earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently held. The use of the puppet head to anchor his internal state and backstory is effective, creating a specific and poignant interiority. However, the character's self-awareness sometimes reads as overly articulated, particularly in the third paragraph ("It was a breathtaking, impossible arrogance..."), which verges on diagnostic self-summary rather than an emotion felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, portraying a compelling internal conflict between his cynical weariness and a "stubborn spark" of duty. This contradiction is not just stated but embodied in his actions—the "weary resignation" of his movements versus the intense focus of his work. The final emotional beat, a "sliver of meaning," feels earned and true to the established character, providing a subtle but powerful change without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation and interiority are exceptionally well-realized; his scientific lens provides a unique and specific texture to his grief. The final change is earned and emotionally resonant. A minor deduction is for a single line of overly explicit motivation ("He was motivated by a desperate need to translate..."), which slightly undermines the otherwise masterful "show, don't tell" approach.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elian's motivation is established with elegant precision and directly fuels the narrative. The internal conflict between his calm demeanor and "profound dissatisfaction" is palpable, driving him to a decisive, costly act. The final choice to scar the perfect tree is an earned and powerful expression of his transformed understanding, demonstrating a character arc completed through action rather than mere reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—"to sandpaper rough memories...until their edges were too smooth to cut"—is both unique and deeply felt, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. The final, earned change is demonstrated through a concrete action (the touch) rather than summarized, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. The Warlord, though brief, provides necessary pressure without distracting from Kaelen's internal journey, making their final interaction highly resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and focused. The motivation to “construct bridges from silos” is compelling and drives the action. However, the direct labeling of his key attribute—“his ability to be empathetically decisive”—is an unnecessary authorial intrusion that tells the reader what should be exclusively shown. While the subsequent action does validate the trait, this initial summary slightly undermines the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation as an “archeologist of abandoned dreams” is exceptionally clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority during the mental dive is vivid and specific, particularly the description of her “helix-minded thinking” as a survival mechanism. The final choice is earned, and the cost is embodied in the single tear, creating a powerful moment of contradictory emotion (joy and sorrow) that feels authentic and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s defining trait, the "prism-mind," is expertly dramatized rather than just stated, culminating in the climax where his unique perception solves the puzzle. His motivation is clear and consistent, and the final cost—a new, heavy responsibility—is earned. A slightly more embodied depiction of his brief panic, rather than labeling it, could have pushed this into the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and sustained. The interiority is concrete and poetic, avoiding cliché; her "symphonically minded" brain is not just a label but a demonstrated way of perceiving the world that directly causes her frustration and her breakthrough. The final change feels earned, a direct result of her shift in method from imposition to release, which forecloses her old, failed path with the felt cost of years of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelan's motivation to find beauty and logic is established clearly and paid off powerfully. The chess tutor background provides a unique and consistent lens for his perceptions. The final micro-choice of dropping the stone is an excellent physical manifestation of his internal shift, earning the change. The characterization is slightly more told than shown in the second paragraph, but the precision of the voice and the earned awe at the climax compensate effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong and specific. The protagonist's unique motivation—cataloging silence for empathy—is established clearly and drives his every action. His interiority is made concrete through the synesthetic descriptions of the frequencies ("tasting of sharp, metallic anger, like biting on foil"), which feels particular to him. The final earned renunciation of the diary's words in favor of its feeling is a perfect expression of his established values, landing with a quiet but palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb, with a clear motivation that is tested and transformed. Elara's internal conflict during the sensory assault is embodied and her micro-choice to focus on the seed's scent is a powerful, active moment. The final shift from "restless striving" to "quiet partnership" represents an earned and credible change, avoiding unearned epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her competence as a pilot is demonstrated through action, not assertion. Her choices are consistent and drive the plot forward effectively. The characterization is very strong but lacks the layer of internal contradiction or a difficult trade-off at the climax that would elevate it to an exceptional level; her path is one of singular, focused determination.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is crystalline and effectively drives the plot from procedural investigation to existential weigh-in. The characterization is sharp and efficient, defined by his esoteric professionalism. The final emotional beat—the hollow victory and the weight of knowledge—is earned and lands with force, fulfilling the arc. The character reads as a highly competent instrument for the narrative, with interiority that is functional rather than deeply contradictory until the final, powerful shift.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear, but he functions more as a mythic archetype than a person with complex interiority. His dedication is absolute, lacking the friction of internal conflict or doubt that would elevate the characterization. While his calm is described as a "living thing that ebbed and flowed," this is not dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices; he is a perfect instrument for a perfect purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kaelen's motivation is established immediately and his interiority is rendered with concrete, non-clichéd language ("shard of ice in his gut," "grim focus of a dissector"). The final shift in understanding is an earned epiphany, not a sudden unmotivated realization, and the closing image of earned stasis is potent.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is concise and perfectly aligned with his cryptic, detached actions. The characterization is revealed through process and method, especially the brilliant touch of him "borrowing" Anya's sorrow and voice, which is shown effectively. While Anya serves more as a catalyst, her desperation feels authentic, making the dynamic between the cold academic and the grieving client potent and immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s characterization is exceptional for this length. His internal state is vividly embodied through his "chapped knuckles," "nervous rhythm of his heart," and the "frustrating betrayal" of his trembling fingers. The final, earned stilling of his hands provides a powerful physical resolution to his internal arc, demonstrating a change rather than merely stating it. The contradictory impulses—cynical pragmatism versus a longing for his mentor’s confidence—are present throughout and resolve with convincing force.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional, built on the potent internal contradiction of an "attentive mystic" who is also "firmly grounded." This tension is not just stated but dramatized through his methodical pursuit of a poetic truth. The final, devastating change is perfectly earned, as his core traits—both the mystic's belief and the scientist's need for proof—conspire to lead him to a truth he cannot unsee, fulfilling the 9+ test with a profound and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and carries a profound, integrated cost. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific emotion, particularly in the moments of faltering ("the sudden, sharp void where his name used to be") and resolve. The final earned state of wistful longing without context is a powerful and credible expression of her completed journey and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    The character's motivation is profound and consistent, rooted in his gentle nature. The final choice is earned, and the cost is embodied effectively in the feeling of being "hollowed out." Elian's core trait of "quietly determined" is dramatized through his deliberate actions rather than merely stated, providing a strong foundation for the story's emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained, driving the narrative with precision. The arc from seeker to protector is earned and satisfying. The transition from the "crushing weight" of the truth to the calm resolve to act is slightly too swift, missing a beat of internal conflict or contradiction that would have elevated an already strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.5)
    Silas’s motivation is superb, articulated not as abstract heroism but as a specific, personal need “to bottle the feeling of safety that the steady beam had always given him.” This internal drive is perfectly consistent, fueling his journey and his final act of care for the light itself. The character’s established reticence makes the silent language of stones and the final, wordless act of farewell feel earned and deeply poignant, meeting the 9+ test for earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelan’s motivation is clear and his emotional state is well-embodied, particularly the shift from manic glee to "profound and shadowed wonder." The character is a strong archetype, but the "why" behind his grand motivation—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—remains abstract, preventing a deeper, more particularized sense of character. His internal state is consistent but lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in his unique combination of profession and new physiology. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, successfully linking the dye master's focus on pigment and light to his new curiosity. The final choice to approach the woman is well-earned, representing a meaningful shift from passive observation to active engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s motivation—a "quiet, consuming need to discover what trees witness"—is established early and provides a powerful, specific engine for the entire plot. His actions are perfectly aligned with his interiority, from his patient methodology to his steady hand holding the lantern. The final choice to place the healed shard in the mosaic is an earned and resonant culmination of his established values, showing a credible endurance of his philosophy with the felt cost of having vicariously experienced a traumatic death.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the plot. Her interiority is tied effectively to the story's central problem of fractured memory. However, the characterization lacks significant internal contradiction; she is a vessel for a purpose, and while this is explicitly stated, the absence of competing impulses or flaws beyond the memory issue makes her feel more functional than deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elias as a "compassionate recluse" is superb. His internal conflict between a painful empathy and a curdling loneliness is established with concrete, embodied language ("a constant, low-grade fever of the spirit"). The final shift in understanding is earned through the on-page observation of Elara, making the epiphany feel like a discovery rather than an assertion, and the cost of his choice is legible and accepted with newfound peace.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and compelling, rooted in the specific loss of Miller's Bakery. Her internal conflict—hoarding the past as a "private sin" versus actively cultivating a future—is beautifully embodied in her actions. The patrolman's character is sketched with remarkable economy; his single line of dialogue provides a complete, resonant backstory that justifies his decision and elevates the climax from a simple plot turn to a shared human moment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently dramatized through his meticulous, desperate actions. The character's internal state—a blend of professional duty and profound sorrow—is embodied in his precise movements and focused attention, avoiding any sentimental summary. The final acceptance of his purpose is earned, representing a powerful form of Earned Stasis where he finds meaning not in changing his fate but in fulfilling his role within it.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptional, rooted in the unique and compelling ambition "to capture the sound of trust breaking." This concept perfectly frames her actions and provides a deeply personal stake beyond the plot mechanics. Her progression from indirect to direct tactics is psychologically sound, and her final choice is an earned synthesis of her observational nature and her need to act. The character reads as a genuine and flawed individual, not a collection of traits.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization as a "luminous skeptic" is superb, providing a compelling internal conflict that drives the narrative. Her motivation is clear and specific, and her shift from seeking a "mechanism" to understanding a "map" is an earned, resonant change. The contradiction between her rigorous hypothesis and her intimate, sensory method of detection is dramatized effectively, culminating in a final renunciation of certainty that feels profound rather than simplistic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied internal conflict between commercial success and artistic integrity. His defining trait—the mnemonic gift—is both a miracle and a curse, a contradiction that plays out in the scene. The final change is earned through a shift in perception, and the single tear is a perfect, concrete image of his emotional release and the cost of his journey.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptional for this length. Elian's motivation is established with elegant economy through his relationship with the Silver-Vein fern and his "quiet obsession." The final choice to become a "cultivator of the truth" is a perfectly earned transformation, rooted in his established values and catalyzed by the discovery. His interiority is specific and avoids cliché, making the shift from passive artisan to active agent feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, a pure expression of purpose that fits the story's mythic tone. His interiority is conveyed effectively through embodied action and perception, such as feeling the ice's song "thrumming faintly against his palms." While the characterization is consistent and strong, it lacks a moment of internal contradiction or a flaw that complicates his task, portraying him as a near-perfect vessel for his art rather than a person struggling with competing impulses; this holds it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from the inciting incident to the final step. The internal conflict is well-dramatized during the climax, where the "static" becomes a tangible, oppressive force that must be overcome through an act of will. The final change is earned and resonant, though the concluding line about Elara's soul becoming the "seed of my own" borders on being an overly neat thematic summary rather than letting the image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks compelling internal conflict. He operates more as a philosophical instrument than a flawed individual, and his method succeeds without setback or doubt, making him feel more archetypal than specific. While his actions align perfectly with his stated beliefs, the absence of any contradictory impulse or moment of struggle makes the earned change feel preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, specific, and compelling. The internal conflict between logic and intuition is well-dramatized through her actions, particularly the shift from analytical attempts to the physical interpretation of the dance. The final choice to embrace chance feels earned, a credible evolution from her established traits and the central problem she faces.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas's motivation is established with poignant clarity in the first paragraph and remains the unwavering engine of the story. His interiority is rendered through specific, embodied sensations—"a pull in the marrow of his bones"—rather than abstract labels. The final shift from haunted desperation to determined hope is earned by the on-page experience, representing a credible change with the felt cost of the immense, ongoing struggle ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is pristine and her competence is absolute, but the characterization lacks a crucible. There is no moment of internal contradiction, doubt, or a difficult micro-choice that reveals a deeper hierarchy of values. The "tranquil blaze" is a compelling image of her state, but the story depicts a flawless execution rather than a struggle, which keeps the character portrait beautifully rendered but emotionally distant.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is excellent. Clara’s core motivation is established in the first sentence and drives the entire narrative, culminating in a choice to trade a comfortable illusion for a difficult truth. Elias is rendered with memorable, specific details—the scent of lavender, the cold teacups, the voice like dry leaves—that build his mystery without cliché. The relationship, built on "agreed upon lies," provides a compelling crucible for the story's central questions about truth and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear, compelling, and consistent. The internal conflict between his “charmed skeptic” nature and his profound longing is dramatized effectively, particularly when his skepticism screams against the experience. The final choice to pursue wholeness over safety feels earned, and the resulting shift from “ghostly resolve” to “quiet strength” provides a satisfying character arc with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, elevating his actions from mere plot mechanics to a profound internal struggle. The concept of a “forgery of compassion” provides a rich, contradictory interiority that is consistently embodied. His competence is perfectly balanced with the immense, trembling strain of his task, making the final earned peace highly resonant. The characterization is nearly flawless, showing a hierarchy of values through a single, high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra’s motivation is powerful and clear, driving the narrative from a personal question to a cosmic purpose. The final shift in her role feels earned and satisfying. A minor weakness is the direct labeling of her core trait ("her attribute, being so richly perceptive, was both a gift and a curse"), which tells rather than shows, momentarily flattening the otherwise strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her final emotional shift is earned through her actions. The characterization is sharp and consistent, with her competence driving the plot. While she lacks significant internal contradiction during the main action, her purpose is so clear and compelling that it serves the story's mythic tone perfectly, fulfilling the 9+ criteria of an earned change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is superb, establishing a consistent and compelling motivation—"to appreciate hidden effort"—that drives every action from making tea to whistling at fireflies. The internal conflict between observation and participation ("demure audacity") feels authentic and is resolved with a nuanced epiphany. The final choice is earned, with the minor but tangible cost of the cooling tea providing a perfect, understated anchor to his internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen's motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is established early and drives every action with perfect consistency. The character is a model of professional competence, with their sharp observance translating directly into plot-advancing choices. However, Kaelen reads more as a highly effective instrument for solving the plot's puzzle than a character with deep internal contradictions; the emotional landscape remains largely unexplored in favor of methodical procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is established as a "simple, terrible thing" and remains the story's unwavering engine. His core trait—allegiance to the dawn, not the shadows—is tested directly in the climax, and his final choice is an earned, decisive affirmation of that trait. The internal conflict is clear and the emotional progression from isolated academic to panicked fulcrum to decisive leader is compelling and well-paced.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s motivation is singular and powerfully realized through his actions. The internal state—a "positively wistful ache" and "sweet sorrow"—is consistent and embodied in his reverent handling of the music box and his methodical collection of sounds. The character is an archetype, but rendered with such specific, gentle purpose that he feels unique; the final, quiet choice to place the seashell is a perfectly earned grace note that confirms his values.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, anchored by the compelling trait of being "logically emotional." This is successfully dramatized when she acknowledges and files away her dread, and particularly during the climax where her logical mind battles her body’s protest. Her motivation is clear and her competence is established, making her struggle and subsequent exhaustion feel earned. The execution is nearly flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a sharply defined internal conflict between impatience (the "wild animal") and the need for precision. The motivation is clear and embodied, culminating in the final line where the internal state is reconfigured with earned finality. The contradictory impulses act in scene, making the final choice and its resulting stasis feel both inevitable and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation to assert his professional autonomy is established early and provides a strong throughline. The internal conflict between his empirical worldview and the inexplicable sensations from the lantern is dramatized effectively, showing contradictory impulses in-scene. The final choice is a direct, earned consequence of this struggle, resulting in a credible character change articulated in the final line about his "fortified quiet" mind.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Arthur's motivation—to find a tangible response to a spiritual failure—is clear and compelling, while his internal state of "faith wrestled with fact" creates immediate, quiet tension. Elias serves as a perfect foil, his craftsman's patience contrasting with Arthur's spiritual urgency, and their brief interaction feels authentic and weighted. The final change in Arthur is earned by the scene's central metaphor, satisfying the demand for a credible transformation with a felt cost (the release of his guilt and the humbling redefinition of his role).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, driving the entire narrative from the philosophical "to ring a bell no one hears yet" to the visceral test flight. His defining trait—stubborn curiosity—is demonstrated through years of ritual, not just stated. The final embodied emotion, a "wild, booming laugh...of pure, sacrilegious joy," is a perfectly earned and complex culmination of his lonely pursuit, satisfying the 9+ test of a choice earned by prior causality with a visible cost (his profound isolation).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, driving every action. The trait "brightly attentive" is earned on the page, not just stated, through her observation of the numerical pattern. The lie to Kael is a superb micro-choice under pressure, revealing a clear hierarchy of values where finding her brother's truth outweighs her professional safety. The final change is earned through this consistent, obsessive focus.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, but its articulation feels too much like a thesis statement (“to map empathy onto action”). The characterization suffers from a lack of internal contradiction; he is presented as a flawless arbiter. The line “He was a courageous anomaly” is a diagnostic label that undermines the character's earned authority, telling the reader how to feel about him rather than letting his actions prove it.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and sustained. The internal conflict between her settled decision to die and her need for comprehension is dramatized through her actions, particularly the handling of the parasol tip—a relic of a beginning—while searching for the sound of an ending. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, original metaphors ("clipped-off sentences of interrupted lives," "patience... like old fabric") that avoid cliché and earn the final, profound shift in her emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's character is rendered with specificity and depth, his vocation providing a powerful, non-obvious lens for his interiority. The internal conflict is clear, and the final shift from guarding a wound to tending a memory is earned and credible. The motivation feels authentic, rooted in years of quiet contemplation, avoiding a sudden, unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from his departure to the final consecration. His interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in the "whisperfield calm" required for his task. The characterization is strong, but misses the 9-band because the internal conflict is a straightforward opposition (purity vs. corruption) rather than a dynamic interplay of contradictory impulses within Kael himself; he is resolute from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, and his actions are perfectly aligned with his "perceptively calm" demeanor. The characterization serves the story's conceptual core with great consistency. However, he functions more as a perfectly calibrated artistic medium than a character with palpable internal contradictions; his immense task is presented without the friction of doubt or struggle, which keeps the portrayal just shy of the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptional, establishing a coherent and compelling internal world. Elias's shift from a curator of static endings to a witness of living process is profound and earned. The final choice to "testify" through silence is a powerful culmination of his reticent nature, demonstrating a deep, earned change with a clear, felt cost—the loss of public discovery for the sake of private truth.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling and specific internal contradiction. Silas’s motivation to “capture the sound of growing older” is established with poetic clarity, and his “precognitively forgetful” nature creates a powerful, immediate conflict. The final choice—to draw a simple circle instead of the forgotten sigil—is a profound, earned act of renunciation and acceptance, showing a complete character who can adapt when his core competence fails, with the felt cost of his original life's work.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear, linking his lifelong quest to the immediate crisis through the lens. The choice to sacrifice his treasured object is a powerful, earned culmination of his character arc. His calm competence under pressure is well-drawn, although the key phrase describing his grief, "luminous ache," borders on being a repeated label rather than a fully embodied internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and drives every action, creating a powerful sense of purpose. However, her characterization as a "serene" and "decisively kind force" lacks the internal conflict or contradictory impulses needed for the highest tier of complexity. She functions more as a flawless, benevolent archetype—a perfect instrument of mercy—than a fully textured individual grappling with the weight of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait—quiet deliberation—is demonstrated through action, not just stated. Her interiority is sharp, focused, and perfectly aligned with her role as a scholar confronting a conceptual problem. The final feeling of "profound satisfaction" is fully earned by the intellectual struggle depicted, providing a resonant emotional closure for a character-driven by the pursuit of sense.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is very strong, with a compelling and clear internal contradiction between Elias's rationalism and his grief-fueled yearning. The bone-setting profession provides a fantastic, concrete metaphor for his worldview that pays off powerfully at the climax. The final earned change is credible and moving, showing a man forced to accept a "fracture" in his soul. The character's core motivation is clear and consistent, compelling his actions throughout the story.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a well-integrated backstory (grandmother, village fire) that directly fuels her present actions. The internal conflict between her trauma of "hungry" fire and her yearning for "patient" starlight is beautifully dramatized in the moment she weighs the warming shard against the memory. Her transformation from passive observer to active creator is earned through a single, sustained, and character-defining action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, her motivation and actions are perfectly aligned. Her interiority as a "watchful dreamer" is demonstrated, not just stated, culminating in an action born of quiet observation. Kaelen's state is effectively embodied through his silence and haunted posture, making him a potent object for Elara's efforts rather than requiring deep interiority of his own. The change in him is subtle but credible, earned entirely by the specificity of Elara's gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict is not just stated but embodied in his struggle against the "current." The final choice to become a "keeper" instead of an "author" represents a profound, earned change, resolving his core contradiction with a visible, felt cost—the burial of the seashell.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s characterization as a tinkerer is masterfully integrated into the central conflict. His motivation is clear and his internal state is well-embodied, particularly the use of his “tinkerer’s ear” to detect dissonance in the magic. This specific trait transforms a generic magical act into a personal, skill-based triumph, earning the final change in his stance from hopeful practitioner to purposeful teacher.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation is singular, potent, and dramatized through every action, culminating in the tangible cost of pouring his "own stillness into the design." His interiority is conveyed not through summary but through focused, ritualistic action, embodying a profound sense of purpose. The characterization is flawless for this story's mythic, archetypal register, and the final choice is a perfect expression of his established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation, "to store wonder in the cellar of reason," is a superb, paradoxical axiom that fuels the entire narrative. His core attribute of peripheral focus is not just a label; it is fully dramatized as his working method, creating a powerful link between character and action. The final moment of quiet observation is an earned stasis, a perfect culmination of his reflective nature without needing an overt emotional display.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and his interiority is rendered with concrete, unique sensations ("a shard of glass in the psychic current"). The core contradiction of his boundary-less consciousness and physical imprisonment provides a powerful, constant source of tension. The final act of placing the stone demonstrates an Earned Stasis that feels both profound and costly, fulfilling the character's established drive perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by the specific and contradictory trait of being “hauntingly practical.” Her motivation to “harvest lessons from loss” is not merely stated but dramatized through her controlled ritual. The internal conflict between overwhelming grief and the need for manageable containment is embodied in her actions, culminating in a choice—the first cut—that feels both inevitable and earned, foreclosing sentimental wallowing for a more active, tangible form of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict is masterfully externalized through the ghost, and the protagonist's contradictory impulses—denial versus a yearning for truth—are dramatized in their confrontation. The shift from "negotiating" with the past to "bearing witness" is a profound and earned change, with the cost being the final death of youthful pride. Kael’s flaw, ambition, is not just a label but the causal engine of the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, progressing from a philosophical search to a tangible engineering problem. Her interiority is specific and revealing, particularly the concept of being "functionally creative." The final shift in understanding is earned by her direct agency, making the concluding beat—writing new calculations—a powerful embodiment of her character change.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias's motivation is established with poignant precision in the backstory of his dream, and his internal conflict is embodied in the physical act of carrying the coffer—"a final, arduous portage." The resolution, where the weight is not removed but transformed into a "foundational stone," is an earned and mature character change. His actions, particularly the "excruciatingly gentle" placement of the bells, are perfectly aligned with the patient, reverent identity forged by twenty years of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is established with compelling specificity in the first paragraph—he seeks to "understand the architecture of lies," a goal far more nuanced than simple vindication. His interiority is consistently rendered through his actions and tactile perceptions, particularly his reliance on instinct and touch. The final earned epiphany demonstrates a profound and credible character change, satisfying the 9+ quick test as his quest resolves into serene acceptance, a shift earned through the story's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is strong, with a clear and consistent motivation rooted in a compellingly specific worldview. Elias’s interiority is well-drawn through his actions and perceptions, particularly the line defining his patience not as a virtue but an "alignment with the pace of the world he studied." The character reads as a fully realized archetype, though the lack of any significant internal conflict or flaw beyond the external puzzle of the knot keeps the score just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to understand the geography of healing—is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. The change in his understanding is earned through the central vision, and his final act of writing is a credible and resonant expression of this change. While his internal conflict is subtle, his professional empathy and purpose are so well-defined that his role as a vessel for Elara's story feels potent rather than passive.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptional, with Kaelen’s motivation established as a potent, singular ache that drives every subsequent action. His interiority is conveyed through embodied emotion—"quaking reverie," lungs that "burned"—rather than abstract labels. The final moment of acceptance, where the "quaking in his hands finally cease," provides a powerful, earned change that forecloses his nostalgic idealism at a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and rooted in a compelling internal contradiction that drives the plot. The choice to sacrifice the coin is a powerful, earned culmination of her internal struggle. However, the final paragraph’s direct articulation of her life’s purpose ("Her father had taught her how things break. She had spent her life learning how they heal...") slightly undermines the preceding embodied action, slipping from interiority into thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist's core conflict between skepticism and inherited belief is established with nuance and resolved through action, not declaration. Her interiority is specific and concrete, particularly in the description of her "realistically imaginative mind" which justifies her methodical approach to a seemingly magical task. The resolution, where she "listened to her proof," provides a perfect, earned closure to her internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.5)
    Xylar’s motivation is exceptionally clear and its internal conflict is embodied, not summarized. The epiphany is earned through interaction with a key object, making the final change in stance feel both profound and inevitable. The character's sentimentalism is not just a label; it is the engine of the plot and the mechanism of its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is crystalline and his interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly the concept of a "thundering calm." The final change is earned through a sustained, dramatized process of meditative work rather than a sudden epiphany. His actions are perfectly aligned with his thoughtful, obsessive nature, making the resolution feel inevitable and deeply satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is profound and consistent. The internal conflict between Elias's precise, orderly nature and the chaotic, necessary release of grief is vividly dramatized. His motivation is clear and deeply rooted, and his final feeling of a "burden correctly shouldered" is an earned, nuanced resolution. A minor deduction for slightly over-articulating the motivation ("His motivation was not memory, but to restore shared balance...") where showing might have been even more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific: not to speak with a ghost, but "to discover the shape of intentions left behind." This nuanced goal is pursued with a consistency that defines his character, shown through his meticulous, surgeon-like actions. The final internal shift from obsessive searching to peaceful understanding feels earned, a direct result of his efforts. The characterization is subtle and strong, with his competence and quiet obsession creating a believable, compelling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his title and the existential threat to his people. The interiority is strong, especially in showing how his imagination is constrained by data. However, the story falls just short of the highest marks because the peak moment of internal conflict relies on summary ("He felt the immense pressure of the moment") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and resonant, moving from a professional duty to a near-sacred purpose. The internal conflict is perfectly embodied in the phrase "thistled calm," capturing the blend of quiet focus and underlying tension. His actions are precise reflections of his character—the "practiced grace" with the radio, the "reverent" movements of his pen—making his devotion tangible and earning the story's quiet, powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, defined by the powerful contradiction between her serene, professional exterior and her knowing, burdened interior ("heart a heavy, knowing stone"). Her motivation to "crystallize a fleeting emotion" is clear and consistently drives her actions, which are a compelling mix of compassion and calculated deception. The internal conflict is shown, not told, through her deliberate omissions, making her a complex and memorable protagonist whose final cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.5)
    Silas’s characterization is superb, driven by a compelling internal contradiction between his profound purpose and his agony over its futility. The 9+ quick test is met: his contradictory impulses—the desire to teach versus his contempt for ignorance—are dramatized in the scene with the girl. The final choice, a renunciation of teaching in favor of remembering, is an Earned Stasis that lands with the visible cost of his accepted isolation, making his quiet endurance both credible and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear, and his internal conflict between hope and resignation is embodied rather than stated. The character arc is perfectly scaled for this length, pivoting from "expectantly resigned" to "purely expectant" in a manner that feels earned by the story’s central insight. The characterization is strong because his competence is balanced with a genuine struggle, making his final breakthrough credible.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is pristine and his unique mode of perception—tasting memories—is brilliantly integrated. The characterization is strong and consistent. The score is capped below 9.0 because his internal state lacks contradiction; he proceeds with perfect conviction, which slightly flattens the potential for deeper conflict. The line "an act of guided synaptic plasticity" feels like a narrator's diagnostic label, momentarily pulling away from the chef's established "informal wisdom" and into a more academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and compelling, and his central choice—to offer a riddle instead of a datum—is a perfect dramatization of his internal conflict against “bleak pragmatism.” His involuntary truthfulness is a well-integrated constraint that elevates the stakes of his choice. Lena’s transformation is credible, though she serves more as a catalyst for Silas’s action and the story’s thematic vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is specific, consistent, and provides a powerful engine for the narrative. Her interiority is rendered with concrete sensory detail (the orris root) and a well-realized internal conflict between her quiet nature and the “hushed blaze of conviction.” The final shift in understanding is earned by her actions, representing a credible evolution rather than an unearned epiphany. The characterization is flawless, meeting the highest standards.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s transformation from indoctrinated soldier to nuanced thinker is earned and compelling. Her internal conflict is shown, not just told, through the contrast between her ingrained training and the new reality she witnesses. The line "Your certainty was a cage" perfectly crystallizes her internal state and the stakes of her choice, while her final thought—a feeling of "quiet, welcome complexity"—provides a powerful, earned resolution that demonstrates change without over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's esoteric motivation is established with conviction and clarity, avoiding abstraction through concrete action. The internal state is perfectly embodied in the final paragraph, where the "fresh wound in his soul" coexists with a "profound sense of triumph," demonstrating a complex, earned emotional state. The final shift in perspective, seeing the prison as a canvas, is a powerful and earned change rooted in the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-grounded in a specific past event, compelling the entire narrative arc. His interiority is concrete, especially the blend of "methodical hope" and creeping doubt during the climax. However, the direct statement of his motivation—"to prove that strangers remember kindness"—borders on a thematic label, slightly reducing the power of showing versus telling and preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alistair's motivation is clear and his defining trait ("historically oriented") directly enables the story's resolution, which is a strength. The shift from preserving artifacts to using living culture as a tool for survival is a compelling mini-arc. The characterization is slightly weakened by a linear emotional progression from despair to hope, which feels competent but lacks the deeper, contradictory impulses in-scene that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and powerful, driving every action in the narrative. The final internal state of "bleak exhilaration" is perfectly earned, showing a complex and contradictory emotional reality that avoids simple resolution. The character is defined by a single obsession, but this focus is a strength at this length, providing a powerful and coherent core.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between the curse as a wound and its potential as a weapon is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice that is both surprising and inevitable. The final acceptance of his "void" as an "anchor" is an earned change, foreclosing the path to conventional wholeness with a palpable cost and a newfound, albeit grim, purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent with his role as a "prophet" who turns obstacles into instruments. His internal state is well-embodied as "anticipation for the performance" rather than simple fear. However, his interiority remains focused on the task at hand; there is little sense of a deeper personal history or internal contradiction, making him feel more like a highly competent functionary of the story's magic than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, escalating from a personal quest to understand his mother's fate into an obsession that drives the plot. His interiority is conveyed with concrete, physical sensations, as when "the dread was a physical thing now, a sun-baked certainty." The final pivot from a need for understanding to the burden of convincing his people is an earned and powerful change, showing a character transformed by the truth he uncovered.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivations for both Aris and Elara are crystal clear and drive the central conflict effectively. Aris's methodical, dispassionate nature is well-established and consistent with his actions. Elara's shift from guardian to collaborator is earned within the story's intellectual framework, her change believably triggered by a logical rather than emotional appeal. A slight deduction is for the characters feeling more like exceptionally well-drawn archetypes (The Rationalist, The Guardian) than uniquely contradictory individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction between Elias’s stoic exterior and his deeply felt internal mission is dramatized effectively, not just stated. His motivation is specific and compelling, rooted in family history and a unique worldview. The climactic, frantic search for the inkwell is a powerful embodiment of his values, breaking his composure and revealing the "fierce tenderness" beneath. The final shift to an "unshakeable purpose" is earned through this trial.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias is a superbly realized character for this length. His motivation is established early and his defining trait, "tranquilly perceptive," is demonstrated through action rather than just stated. The story's pivot from uncovering an "ugly truth" to a feeling of "clarifying calm" is an excellent, non-obvious emotional progression that showcases genuine interiority. The final choice to pursue quiet correction is earned by the preceding discovery and feels entirely consistent with the established character.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is intensely clear and his internal conflict is beautifully externalized through his craft. The action of polishing the gem during his ascent is a masterstroke of showing character through action, transforming a passive journey into an active struggle. The final, earned change—where his heart begins to follow his hands—is resonant and forecloses his prior paralysis with a tangible cost, which is the acceptance of a beautiful but broken promise.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation rooted in a crucible of grief and scientific intellect. The interiority is specific and potent, particularly in how Amal translates emotional constants like "the scent of the crushed jasmine" into mathematical variables. The final shift from abstract hunt to targeted trajectory is a perfectly earned and chilling evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative forward effectively. However, her characterization relies more on stated labels ("perpetually surprised," "lonely operator") than on dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her interiority is functional but lacks the specific, complex texture that would elevate her beyond a competent vehicle for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in a specific, embodied guilt ("sieved hush," "acidic burn"). The final shift from a trafficker in lies to a restorer of truth is a powerful and earned reversal, directly caused by the climax. The internal conflict is elegantly established, with his "damning talent" being both the source of his past pride and present curse, which perfectly sets up his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized, not just stated. The internal conflict is embodied in the physical act of worrying the drawer pull, connecting his past failure to his present-tense choices. His perception of Kaelen as a "mirror" rather than an adversary reveals a complex interiority that elevates the scene beyond a simple transaction. The characterization is flawless through the climax, earning a very high score.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, presenting a clear internal conflict with a well-defined motivation rooted in past failure. The contradiction between the man who knew the stars and the man who follows power lines is potent and consistent. His internal state is convincingly embodied through his actions, particularly the private joke of humming a jaunty funeral dirge. While the explicit statement of his motivation ("align heart and action") is a touch too diagnostic, the overall portrait of a competent man broken by a single error is rendered with nuance and credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his detached interiority is well-suited to the premise. The final emotional shift from numbness to a "tiny, fragile spark" is earned through the discovery of the letter. However, the final paragraph’s articulation of his new path borders on overly diagnostic self-awareness, slightly undermining the raw, embodied feeling described just before it.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptional, anchored by a powerful and clear motivation. Elian’s internal conflict—the desire for reunion warring with the fear of self-erasure—is dramatized with precision, particularly in the contrast between his “paradoxically steady” hands and the internal “tremor of resistance.” The final surrender is earned, making the transformation a costly, character-driven choice rather than a passive event.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is potent and specific, rooted in the visceral experience of new motherhood. The internal conflict between her professional power as a seer and her personal powerlessness is the story's engine. The final change feels earned, a direct result of her internal struggle, not an unearned epiphany; the tracing of her hand is a powerful, embodied choice that demonstrates her new resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is singular and immense, and her internal state is powerfully embodied through the unique physical mechanic of changing gravity. The final confrontation with her own photograph provides a credible and earned climax, resolving her internal conflict with a choice—acceptance—that aligns perfectly with her established pacifist nature. The emotional progression feels both authentic and mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, but largely philosophical. His character is defined more by a state of being—curiosity and receptiveness—than by active, difficult choices born of contradictory impulses. The climactic act of releasing the fireflies feels more like an inevitable artistic impulse than a high-stakes decision, making him an elegant but somewhat passive vessel for the story's events. The core trait of being an "unwitting servant" is well-executed but inherently limits the depth of internal conflict shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his defining trait of "calmly inventive" is demonstrated effectively through his actions. The internal conflict is well-embodied by the contrast between his "practiced casualness" and the "tremor in his own veins." However, the characterization relies on a summary block early on ("Kael was a man of winking hush and secrets...") that tells the reader his traits directly, rather than letting them emerge solely through the unfolding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in his curse and a promise to a mentor, compelling a high-stakes choice that feels inevitable. The character's internal state is conveyed through his precise actions and his relationship to the environment, avoiding summary. The final shift from observer to actor is earned through the climax, representing a meaningful change with the cost of using his one "last resort" tool.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal contradiction of being "furiously tranquil" is not just stated but dramatized, culminating in the mask slipping and his hands "finally, honestly trembling." The motivation to "understand the cartography of scars" is clear, consistent, and powerfully reconfigured by the story's end into a need for active confrontation, an earned change with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and demonstrated through action, aligning perfectly with the “dueling philosopher” archetype. His competence is compelling, but the characterization remains largely intellectual, lacking embodied emotional conflict or contradictory impulses. The thin, appreciative smile is a somewhat generic beat for a character whose inner world could offer more specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation as the Architect is clear and compelling, and the monthly molt is an excellent character device that justifies the story's hopeful turn. His final choice to welcome the strangers is a well-earned expression of his established persona. The only minor weakness is the dialogue of his poem, which feels slightly more like a thematic statement than something a person would say in that moment, slightly flattening his voice at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, evolving from "silvered sorrow" to a "blade" of "steely longing." This internal shift from passive grief to active defiance is well-dramatized and directly fuels the climactic action. The final, resolute glance at the clock provides a perfect, small action that confirms his transformation and earned resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict between her empirical duties and the need for faith is the story's powerful engine. The change in her relationship with doubt, from an anxious flicker to a luminous, integrated part of memory, is an earned and resonant arc. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, though the phrasing at times feels slightly more authorial than character-native (e.g., "empirically whimsical world").

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is clear, and his internal state is rendered with concrete, specific interiority ("crystalline shard of his guilt") rather than abstract labels. The central contradiction between his "rhythmically placid" actions and the internal "tides of remembrance" is beautifully sustained, and the final shift to quiet contemplation is earned and resonant.

    Elara's motivation to heal lost love is clear and intensifies through her breathing ritual, rooted in spiritual curiosity that compels her choices; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the ache behind her eyes revealing contradictory impulses of pain and hope.

    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in his synesthesia and past betrayal, driving high-stakes choices like unsealing jars despite trembling hands. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses evident in fighting the aurora's distraction while pouring absences. The final renunciation of pain's echo feels earned with visible emotional cost, foreclosing unchecked grief.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's motivation evolves from stealing portraits for past echoes to embracing future possibilities, rooted in consistent traits like quiet savvy, with embodied emotion in his chill of fear and exhilaration; interior conflict shows through his pilgrimage-like approach to the jar, revealing contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of his old life feels earned with visible cost as portraits turn inert. No stock phrasing mars the specificity, though the shift could show more simultaneous contradiction mid-heist.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation to craft safe zones is clear and rooted in her grief, intensifying under pressure to compel her abandonment; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the "slushy ache" revealing contradictory impulses.

Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock epiphanies, as seen in the shift from programmed fears to "violent, powerful certainty" earned by prior discoveries. Julian's presence applies immediate pressure, forcing a status shift from puppet to architect, though his characterization leans slightly one-note as a cruel overseer.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen's mild obsession is concretely embodied in his precise, inward-focused ritual, revealing contradictory impulses between compulsion and patience, with the final endurance foreclosing immediate relief at a felt cost of perpetual waiting; interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing traits through micro-choices like tracing the glyph without looking at the star.

    Elias's motivation to thaw mistrust is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like examining doodles and deciding to eavesdrop, rooted in consistent traits of yearning and grief; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as the cool weight of the lens mirroring his emotional frost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aris’s initial clinical detachment and final humble re-integration into messy reality are coherent and embodied. The grief spike for the orchid and subsequent micro-choice to wipe the pane are particular, costed, credible. Interior contradiction stays on the page (“the drama is the process itself”). Earned Stasis/renunciation is present with felt shovel-seeking intent.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s interiority is embodied (shaking hands, deliberate archaeology) and her shift from fear to purposeful kiln-lighting is earned. The contradictory impulse—fear of fire vs need to understand—drives micro-choices. Cost is felt: she seals the ledger strip, accepting its ghosts. Secondary characters are off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—turning silence into music—is crystalline and drives every micro-choice; her embodied, contradictory interiority (terror vs wonder) is palpable. The trauma flashback is not merely recalled but woven into the present action, forcing a visible cost. The final renunciation (closing the case) earns its poise because her earlier struggle to transform the orange/indigo into violet/white has foreclosed easier paths. Only the lack of a second on-page character prevents full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s weariness is embodied in salt-stained fingers and “cold, wet sand” settling in bone; his stubborn refusal to endure the psychic static is dramatized through the folding of reality itself. The interior contradiction—desperate for silence yet willing to endure crushing pressure—drives every beat. The final calm is earned because the cost (lifetime of noise + physical/psychic toll) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (“hollowed cheeks,” “stooped shoulders”), her contradictory impulses (hunger vs suspicion, curiosity vs caution) play out in scene, and her final renunciation—choosing to plant rather than merely consume—carries visible communal cost. The bell’s recognition triggers a credible shift from survival to cultural stewardship. Minor slip: the phrase “gently persistent” is label-speak rather than dramatized trait.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s spiritual curiosity is embodied in her tactile handling of the camera and the breathing ritual; the contradiction between wanting to retrieve lost love and accepting its transformation is dramatized through the micro-choice of exhaling the memory. The final tear-blurred vision shows earned cost: she renounces possession of the love and accepts its diffusion. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only sensory metaphors tied to her craft. One minor slip: “pilgrim of sparks” leans toward label, not lived trait.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s monastic drive and the embodied cost of memory-loss are vivid; the interior contradiction—clutching the fragment while fearing its erosion—grounds every beat. The final renunciation is earned because the maze’s geometry has been dramatized as his only lever. Missing: a second on-page character to test status, but the solo arc is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s patient strategy is embodied in every micro-choice; the chain, the keys, the arrow all act as extensions of her will. Interiority is precise—her “profound stillness” and “silent game” reveal motive without exposition. The final renunciation—remaining chained while purpose is freed—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s synesthesia and obsession with the “sound of trust breaking” are embodied through tactile micro-choices—unsealing jars, pouring absences, fitting the crystal—each action revealing hierarchy of values.

Backstory fragments are anchored to present objects (pillow hollow, unsent letters) and tilt tactics. The final silence in his ear is earned by prior causality and carries felt cellular cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“a chill traced its way up his spine”), but the shift from portrait thief to custodian of futures is asserted more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost yet lacks a prior micro-choice that visibly forecloses the old life.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bookmark triggers a credible thaw of grief that alters her final choice. The renunciation of the sphere carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her escalating fear. Minor slip: “crystalline prison of grief” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is visceral and embodied—palms on cold metal, stomach lurch—while contradictory impulses (terror vs resolve) act simultaneously. Motivation pivots from programmed survival to self-authored purpose, earned by the child-cast cipher and the final choice to trigger containment.

Only the late appearance of Julian keeps relationship crucible off-page, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's interiority is precise—his obsession with mapping darkness is embodied in the tactile act of tracing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior oscillates between yearning and paralyzing silence; embodied reactions (clutching the lens, retreating into damp night) align with motives. The final micro-offering of the box + lens crystallizes an earned renunciation of withheld honesty and forces Lena to receive/return silence transformed. No therapy-speak, misbeliefs corrected only on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his weathered hand on the vine, the pouch ritual—but the manager remains a cipher; her 98-luck score is told, not embodied. The marble-crack motif crystallizes his value hierarchy and earns the final cracked sphere, yet the “wisely pragmatic” trait is asserted more than tested in scene. Still, the contradiction between low luck and living mastery drives every beat, and the cost of tenure loss is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obliging steadiness is embodied in scarred hands and micro-choice to pull the lever; the quiet vertigo and sideways-fall sensation crystallize interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession with the ghost-composer is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tilting the program, lowering it to the water—each revealing a hierarchy of values (music over preservation). The final renunciation—destroying the artifact to birth the song—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by his earlier reverence. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “strange creative fever” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory need to know vs. need to preserve ambiguity is embodied in the micro-choice not to re-read the smudge; the swallowed truth becomes the refusal itself, with visible cost in the “clean, high-altitude ache.” Interiority is specific, but the “fault-tolerant oracle” conceit is more label than lived trait, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“recklessness was a familiar companion”), but the final beat of self-forgiveness is slightly generalized; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“grip reality loosely” dramatized in hallucinated scribes), but the decisive act—tracing the swan’s folds—rests more on ritual than on contradictory impulse; cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; his cautious exuberance is palpable in the eclipse moment. Lena’s micro-choice—hand to earth—earns the shift from desperation to tender protection. The sixty-year grief is sketched with restraint yet felt. Only a slight therapy-register tinge in “nurture lifelong wonder” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is lucid and consistent; the final renunciation of saviorhood lands as earned cost. Interiority is textured (“profound sorrow, heavy and resonant as bronze”) and embodied.

    Elias’s interiority is vivid and consistent—his desire to “transpose life into a new key” threads through every micro-choice, culminating in the renunciation of his post. The cost of leaving the lighthouse is felt, but the prophetic gift is asserted more than dramatized in scene, blunting contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alistair’s interiority is precise—his “patient, searching pressure” and “muffled clarity” reveal a mind calibrated to paradox. The contradiction between his stillness and the sonic assault he engineers is embodied, not declared. Elara’s agency is minimal, yet her gasp and dropped palette mark a credible, earned release. Cost is visible in Alistair’s “small, tired smile,” foreclosing rest.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s drive is lucid yet embodied: “boundless, ignorant optimism” found at the peak feels earned by his relentless micro-tracings and bone-level ache. Exhaustion and elation knot together in final pen-stroke, paying a visible stamina cost. Interior contradiction—creative ambition vs. physical collapse—remains contradictory in scene. Minor slip: moment of diagnostic label “chronologically homesick” not fully shrugged off until late.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—fighting vs. accepting the memory—is dramatized in the final descent; the embodied cost (loss of buoyancy, re-absorption of fractured selves) lands on the page. Motivation stays consistent: conquer the labyrinth by re-experiencing the drop. Micro-choice to “open himself to the memory” directly triggers closure. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her devotion to her vanished hearing and her engineered silence—are embodied in her boots and the cracked phonograph needle. The ache between joy & grief that powers every micro-choice feels lived, and the final renunciation (the “filament of hush” accepted instead of lost sound) carries visible cost on the audience’s faces and her own blood-lit fingers on the cartridge.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—data fidelity vs. exposure risk—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (pocketing the parchment, deciding not to force a path) under escalating watch. The arc earns its quiet renunciation by lateral infiltration instead of direct confrontation, closing his solitude at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the vial and scent anchor contradictory impulses (seeking vs. fearing memory). The final beat—choosing to inhale the grief—earns its cost through prior sensory caution and the revealed link to Elara. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Micro-choice at climax is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the rope’s tactile memory anchors his ethical playfulness. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—he forfeits both transcendence and curated oblivion. Minor slip: “ethically playful” is asserted more than dramatized until the final wry smile.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—rebellion against void yet reverence for hush—drives every micro-choice; the final bow-stroke renounces noise for resonant silence, costing her the grandfather’s loud past.

The micro-choice to initiate the grant is earned by his prior fixation on “silent contributors.” Only the final beat feels slightly tidy; the cost is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—transient art vs. permanent community—is embodied in the reed-bird dropped and the obsidian polishing cloth accepted. Micro-choices (pointing to the fissure, weaving root-mats) visibly trade solitude for belonging. The final beat earns the shift with felt cost: his art becomes caretaking, not self-expression. Only slight reserve: Lyra remains more catalyst than crucible, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his ambition, fear, and embodied awe anchor every beat. The pendant’s resonance with the nest crystallizes his agency, and the final renunciation of “place” for “moment” carries felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is precise and embodied—his grief is rendered as tactile geometry, not label. The micro-choice to push the “empty space beside me in bed” into the stone crystallizes motive and cost. The only cap is that Lyra remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent; the story compensates by making the void itself the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “peculiar sensitivity” is dramatized through tactile handling of the shard and the physical click of satisfaction. Motivation (“to become visible to those who need you”) is stated early and enacted in the final beat, but the cost is felt more by Anya than by Elias, muting the personal stakes. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the arc is linear rather than internally contested. Still, the micro-choice to place the tape is character-specific and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction between imposed order and innate fragility is embodied in raw knuckles and fogging glass; the ‘circuitously sincere’ self-examination is dramatized in one micro-choice of pocketing the leaf, not reported. Missing a second character prevents relationship crucible points, keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s insomnia, painterly vocation, and “thresh meaning” drive are embodied in sleepless dabs and the final sketch of the woman’s face; the contradictory pull between hoarding the brooch and releasing it crystallizes in the on-page exchange. The woman’s weary patience and inherited loss are sketched with economy, and her presence forces Elias’s decisive renunciation. Cost is felt: he forfeits the object and gains the heavier story. Minor slip: “wryly earnest” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyra’s blindness despite clairvoyance and her renunciation at the threshold are interior contradictions dramatized, making her Earned Stasis both believable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s compulsion to “reclaim the narrative” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thumb on brass, sand brushed from sigil—which anchor his interiority. The vision that flashes only when he touches relics is a lived constraint, not label, and it costs him psychic exposure each time. The widow’s recognition completes his arc: she is moved not by words but by the preserved relic, proving his stance and earning his promise. No secondary on-page character applies status pressure; the bond is between relic and survivor, satisfying single-POV demands.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied—"trembling certainty pulsed in his veins"—and his micro-choice to punch the veil is rooted in mentor-loss grief. The mentor’s fate, revealed as willing guardianship, reweights Elias’s own arc from seeker to keeper with visible cost (acceptance of lifelong exile). The contradiction between analytical mapping and mystical surrender is dramatized, not stated. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s skeptical rationality collides with his grief in embodied micro-choices—thumb on obsidian, charcoal scratching, almost hurling the tile—each action revealing shifting stakes. The final transcription is earned: skepticism dissolves not by fiat but through the tactile labor of converting whale-song into numbers, a visible cost paid in effort and belief. Interior contradiction is alive in scene; no stock labels. One character on page; relationships are memory, not dialogue, so status bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Xylos’s boredom calcifying into purpose is embodied in the shard’s final silence; the interior contradiction (“embraced the curse”) is dramatized, not labeled. Micro-choice—rising to cross the rift—forecloses immortality with visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Slight reserve: we glimpse the millennia but not the texture of lived exhaustion; still, the final step feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is driven by an authentic contradiction—her need to cancel the dishonesty her father encoded in her upbringing. The ‘fair-trade equation’ appears not as epiphanic slogan but as embodied micro-moves (ink pot forgery, corpse cosmetics). Final renunciation—destroying her own integrity for another’s life—feels earned and irreversible. Only the interior voice lapses once into “bizarre parody,” a brief distanced label that softens impact under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “quiet, desperate hunger” is embodied in the dawn ritual; her studious trait drives every micro-choice, and the final warmth of “incandescent restraint” shows earned cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the layering ritual and the poison-label anchor contradictory impulses. Motivation—"to discover the texture of memories"—drives every beat. The final renunciation (waiting for the next tide) is earned and carries visible cost: the layered memory dissolves, leaving only the tin box. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; his “gloomy cheerfulness” and tactile handling of shell and cello reveal a coherent, idiosyncratic mind. The final renunciation—accepting a lifelong, solitary task—carries visible cost and is earned by prior obsession. Minor slip: the phrase “happily at home among them” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—anarchic love vs. tactical order—are dramatized in the graffiti plan and the final squeeze of the stone; the cost of compromise is felt in his “frantic drum” heart. Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic. Secondary pressure from Zola is brief but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s grandfather-haunted motive, embodied via the heirloom spore-catalyst and the Hasselblad ritual, is interiorly rich and drives every choice. The final, camera-silent moment—“a memory far more vivid than any film”—crystallizes renunciation and earned cost without tidy epiphany. Still, emotional layering flirts with poetic over-label (“beautiful, inevitable extinction”) in the peak beat, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied through tactile memory and water-borne vibration; her blindness is not label but active constraint that drives the diagnostic method. Motivation (“decode feedback into direction”) is dramatized in every micro-choice, culminating in the earned stillness of her final gesture. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “subtly confident hum” and the embodied chill of the cabin anchor him. The contradiction between cartographic certainty and mystical faith drives every beat. The final shift from editor to “sole archivist” is earned by the prior futility of radar and satellites, and carries a visible cost: his life’s work is revealed as a joke. Only the mentor remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is spare but consistent; the “infinitely patient” trait is embodied in the deliberate footfalls and the refusal to rush the revival. Motivation (“restore shared balance”) is stated rather than dramatized, yet the final commitment to return tomorrow shows a micro-choice with cost (endless labor). No contradictory impulses are staged, so the arc feels linear rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is palpable—instinct to flee vs. compulsion to finish. The embodied memory assaults (cold stone, salt tears) force micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Final renunciation is earned: the cost is his life, paid to hold the hush. One slip: “primal scream built” drifts toward label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s desire to claim a story of his own is embodied in the tactile choice to break the seal; the cost—accepting lifelong disbelief—lands on the final page. Interiority is specific (“tasted like a lie on the tongues of others”), and the micro-choice to open the door crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The flaw of inherited disbelief is confronted rather than cured, yielding an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bead-triggered memories arrive as sensory jolts, not exposition. Lyra’s spectral pressure forces his micro-choices (touching toxic dew, tending the orchid) that reveal a hierarchy of values—knowledge over safety. The final transference lands as earned renunciation: Lyra dissolves, Elian accepts the cost of sole custodianship. Only the absence of on-page dialogue with Lyra keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.7)
    Contradiction between enduring optimism and the reality of ruin: shown in embodied choosing to stitch even when storm looms. Choice at climax to swap dream-threads for storm-grade rope seals arc with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for certainty while fearing the truth—remains embodied in her tactile, slow excavation. The moment she traces the root across bone and later lifts the sundial base, micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values (ancestral connection over efficiency). Final renunciation of the “tragic end” myth carries visible emotional cost: the hollowness she arrived with is replaced by acceptance, but only after physical labor and re-framed memory.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his tactile handling of the clipboard and chalk, the “quiet hum beneath his skin”—but the contradiction between his yearning for margins and his clinical precision is only asserted, not dramatized in a moment of choice. The final sealing of the letter is a credible renunciation, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (listening vs. acting) coexist in scene. The final choice—risking exposure to transmit the map—carries visible cost in the hush after the green glyph. One slip: the “foolish disguise” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “low tide” energy and bruised eyes anchor her cost. The shard and moonlight tie her flaw to the closure image. Kael’s motivation is dramatized through the condensation scene rather than summary. One micro-choice—angling the shard toward the moon—earns her Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. visceral empathy—surface in the tactile worry of the coral and the deliberate quietness he cultivates; the micro-choice to translate the cast rather than exploit it crystallizes his values and visibly costs him emotional composure, earning the General’s flicker of humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vivid, embodied self-portrait of an aging artist whose memories and micro-choices under creative pressure ring true; the “quiet ache” motive stays felt and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s methodical playfulness is embodied in every micro-choice—flicking the nickel, mapping the garden, orchestrating the final tone-sequence—so the trait drives stakes and closure. Interiority stays concrete (“catalogued the changes,” “traded a single world for multitudes”) without label-speak. The final smile and color choice crystallize a credible renunciation of certainty, paying the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is legible and consistent, but interiority is occasionally abstract (“spark of defiance”); embodied emotion peaks in the final beat. The gourd-seed choice crystallizes values with cost. Secondary pressure from Aris is brief but functional. No major contradictions, yet the charm-to-steel shift could be more textured.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (longing vs. acceptance) act simultaneously in the final beat. The shift from despair to “reef-shadow joy” is earned by the prior accumulation of pain and craft. Micro-choice—lodging the postcard in the moonlit crevice—seals the arc with visible cost. Only the centuries-long span is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—duty vs. foxglove regret—is embodied in the cracked bamboo and the slow, ritual motion; the final “bitter taste” crystallizes cost. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the absence of a second character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—scholarly caution vs. reckless love—are embodied in the moon-quartz ink and the trembling hand. The micro-choice to add the personal regret clause crystallizes his hierarchy of values and carries visible cost (emptied ink, drained blood). Elara’s silent arrival supplies external pressure that forces a relational shift. The final hand-reach earns its poise because every prior beat has bound Kaelen to irrevocable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—duty vs. encoded love—drives every micro-choice; the tremor of his hands over the letters embodies the cost. The final reconfiguration of “duty and love as one machine” is earned by the chain-guided discovery and the ache of the unsent letters. No stock phrasing; voice stays particular to a machinist who thinks in pressure. Minor slip: the mother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—ritualized reinvention vs. the need to speak Lena’s name—are dramatized in the storm beat and the final gift. Interiority is embodied (dust-maps, meteorite in palm) and the micro-choice to hand Anna the scroll carries visible cost. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of grief in the “withering” paragraph. Still, the final stance crystallizes with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—his tracing of wood grain, the chill of “spacial sheer,” the moment he chooses the threshold. Motivation shifts from “go home” to “understand sacred edges,” a credible re-weighting. The final kneel to analyze the chair’s grain shows earned endurance with visible cost: permanent separation. Minor: father’s dictum is slightly expository, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the burnt feather anchors contradictory impulses—grief and hope—without therapy-speak. His micro-choice to dim the dome and wait quietly reveals a hierarchy of values (shared wonder over proof). Elara’s shift from skepticism to awe is credible, but her interiority is sketched rather than dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s curiosity is clear, but interiority stays surface-level; the final smile feels like a label rather than earned contradiction. No embodied cost or struggle is dramatized—only a neat discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is meticulous yet restrained; contradictions of calm versus fevered calculation show in small body cues (“a quiet nudge,” “small internal smile”). Motivation (“serenade monotony”) threads every micro-move and culminates in a renunciation: he withdraws rather than claim applause—cost of eternal anonymity earned. Weakness: minimal on-page contradiction during final beats keeps him beneath the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his refusal of the “sterile, forward-only world” and his embodied dance anchor motive and contradiction. The final transformation is earned: the obsidian verse on his arm is the visible cost of exile becoming genesis. Minor slip: “obsidian grace” repeats as label rather than evolving trait.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—yearning to fix light in glass while sensing its inevitable flux—drives every beat. The stone-skip is a concrete micro-choice that crystallizes his renunciation; the cost is the atrium itself. No stock phrasing; embodied perception (“marrow of his bones,” “texture of the mist”) grounds emotion. Flawed insight (he once believed permanence possible) compounds to Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s scar, the porcelain box, and the “bargained innocence” are embodied and contradictory; his final gesture of closing his hands around the box crystallizes a renunciation with visible cost. Kaelen’s silent tracing of a crack mirrors the mentor’s vulnerability and alters their relationship. Interiority stays concrete and firefighter-specific; no therapy-speak. The earned endurance of the scar and the box’s refusal to be returned land as credible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—“her gaze was lucidly watchful, missing nothing”—and her micro-choice to retreat to the observation stone crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The contradiction between dispassionate puzzle-solving and quiet hope is dramatized, not stated. Cost is felt when the needle dips and her breath catches, anchoring the final stance. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet, embodied curiosity (“to discover what walls dream about”) is consistent and specific, but her final renunciation—leaving the diaries in the hearth—reads more as professional protocol than a crucible of contradictory impulse; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in her body.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; we feel his calm and intent yet never see a contradictory impulse or micro-choice that costs him. The borrowed heartbeat is evoked rather than embodied, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his nervous fingers, calibrated voice, and deliberate ritual choices reveal a man anchoring ideals in practice. The generals’ granite masks and trembling hand externalize decades of hatred and exhaustion, making the signing credible. The only gap: Vorlag’s surrender feels slightly compressed; a beat of embodied hesitation would push this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—ruthless water baron vs. haunted dreamer—are dramatized in the trembling hand that both signs death warrants and cradles the egg. The final renunciation is earned by the memory of birdsong that has silently driven every prior desiccation. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids diagnostic labels. Only the “secretly sentimental” tag edges toward label-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “silent verse” and “stanza of perfect control” reveal motive through motion. The contradiction between chastity and power is dramatized in the dance that untangles grief; the cost is the “immense burden” released in the final sigh. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (tracing patterns, miming the final pull) align with motive and foreclose her role as mere collector.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—serenity vs. doubt—is embodied in the tactile tracing of the stick and crystallizes in the decision to reverse his method; the cost (self-doubt, lost relationship) is felt. Elara’s absence still pressures him via memory and accusation. The final micro-choice—opening the trunk—forecloses retreat and is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“soil and stone rather than ink”—and his contradictory impulses (realist resignation vs. reverent caretaker) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—letting the last butterfly go without rescue—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the dissolving structures. Minor slip: the phrase “quiet cadence finding its rhythm” edges toward therapeutic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is embodied and particular; the “snowmelt ardor” and “technically gentle” hands show motive in action. Contradictory impulses—grief’s residue vs. creator’s zeal—play out in the micro-choice to unbraid the rope. The final renunciation (light not sound) is earned and carries visible cost: the sigil dissolves, leaving only memory. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV depth is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s fractured temporality is embodied in every beat; the micro-choice to dissolve the wafer on his tongue crystallizes his arc. Interiority is specific—"the grit of concrete dust on his skin"—and the final smile carries earned cost. The contradiction between inherited duty and self-transcendence is dramatized, not summarized. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kavi’s conservation ethic is embodied in every gesture; the final sweeping away of dust is a perfect, wordless renunciation that costs him his life’s work yet leaves him fulfilled. Interiority is spare but precise—“empirically ironic” captures his self-aware contradiction. No secondary characters dilute focus; the palace itself becomes a silent antagonist. The earned stasis—keeping the star-cloud secret—carries visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s pacifist-schemer duality is shown through her non-violent yet intricate assault on Vale’s resentment; the cellular-memory gambit is a concrete, risky micro-choice. Interiority stays anchored in sensory transmission rather than therapy-speak. The final fade carries visible cost—her dissolution is the price of success—so the arc earns its closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her breathing ritual, the tear freezing on her cheek—yet the “runaway dream” motivation is stated more than dramatized until the final image. The contradiction between her grounded craft and liminal ambition is present but not fully mined for tension. The earned stasis (she now knows how to read the map) carries visible cost in the shattered frost-mountains, satisfying the closure test.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the quartz-eye, the ribbon, and the seed all act as extensions of his contradictory impulses. The final choice to bind rather than seal is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (leaving the ribbon behind). The only drag is a brief “accidental wisdom” label that edges toward diagnostic speak, but it is immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s contradictory drive—obey “never understand” vs. pursue forbidden knowledge—remains embodied and tense; the micro-choice to pocket the shell and later re-enter the orchard crystallizes his arc with visible cost (rule broken, role redefined). Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only drag is a brief explanatory lull in the bathroom beat that edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s shift from detached scholar to risk-taking negotiator is embodied in micro-choices—catalog cross-checks, tactile handling of the diary, the tremor before the Curators—yet the interior contradiction between fear and duty could be sharper in the final beat to earn the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—desire to resurrect her twin vs. fear of self-erasure—is embodied in every micro-choice (pressing each swatch, gasping at the final void). The final renunciation (“I would be his story”) is earned by the prior beats that literally dissolve her memories. One slip: “blissfully aberrant peace” is label-speak mid-crisis, blunting embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's "translate confusion into clarity" drive is present, embodied, and pays off, but the internal conflict remains largely monoline; no contradictory impulse complicates his final move, so the cost feels cerebral rather than visceral—just shy of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “old bones protesting” and the “fortress of will” against the hum. Motivation (find the quiet) is clear and intensifies through micro-choices: extracting ice, tracing cracks, releasing the pattern. The final renunciation—accepting the eye of the storm rather than banishing it—earns Earned Stasis with visible cost in his exhausted repose. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s loneliness is viscerally embodied (wind as sole companion, breath misting), motive intensifies under pressure—“thistle-blown hope” grows despite creeping despair. Contradictory pull: clinging to meaning in randomness versus embracing final silence. Single moment of waver at climax, then decisive shard placement completes interior arc with visible cost: memory scream accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s preemptive nostalgia is embodied in the “sharp, grieving” anticipation of loss; his micro-choice to measure shadows rather than flee the discordant hum shows a hierarchy of values. The final decision to record the memory of forgetting, not the forgotten memory, is earned by the prior discovery and carries visible cost—he relinquishes the heroic archivist role for a humbler witness. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding label-speak. One slip: “preemptively nostalgic” is named once in exposition rather than dramatized throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—chemical mantras, embodied discouragement, the tactile turn with the rag knot—but the final epiphany leans slightly abstract; the cost of “leaving the fortress” is named rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the cicada, snail, and starlight all refract her stance. The final renunciation is earned by the reflective sequence that reweights loss into transition. One minor slip: “patient transition toward a few glorious weeks” edges toward summary rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s claustrophobia and quest for a breathable silence are embodied in every beat; the porcelain doll’s shift from captive to pilgrim crystallizes his earned courage. Interiority is specific, sensory, and contradictory—his lungs “seized in any room smaller than the sky.” The final stance carries visible cost: he returns to the bunker but the panic does not come, foreclosing retreat. Minor slip: the father remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is precise and embodied; his “fluidly logical” mind is dramatized through the quiet cataloguing of micro-sounds. The passenger’s arc from panic to ease is credibly paced, but her shift feels slightly smoothed—no contradictory impulse lingers to complicate the closure. The cost to Elian is only the familiar solitude, so the renunciation is present yet thin.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her sonic humming and tactile peeling of data-sealer show motive-driven micro-choices. The contradiction between her refusal of power and her willingness to risk everything is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation—walking away crownless—carries visible cost and is earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority—sharp mercy and controlled fire—drives every beat; her renunciation of reunion is embodied and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motives are concrete (bolt as legacy, urge to “translate pressure”), her contradictions (resisting OmniVex 2.0 while courting risk) act simultaneously, and her final turn—stabilizing the Promise—carries earned cost. Minor drift in backstory exposition keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the final realization lands with felt cost. The contradiction between her inherited duty and the dynasty’s deliberate self-erasure is dramatized through the crank ritual. One minor slip: “eloquently silent” edges toward label-speak rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen's drive ("to capture the shape of possibility") is embodied in obsidian-daïs micro-choices: scanning the dying moonlight tree, kneeling on dais, unsnapping clasp. Flawed passivity—“silent panic”—contradicts duty, adding credible tension.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fractured thing since Thomas left”), but her only decisive act is the archival sleeve—too late to pressure earlier choices. The empathy for Joseph is moving yet external; her own heartbreak remains static. Motivation is clear, but the cost is intellectual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s understated competence and quiet endurance are embodied in every micro-choice—her unhurried gait, the coat as camouflage, the final lever-pull. The interior contradiction (resignation vs. refusal to forget) stays alive in the closing image, and the cost—permanent exposure, possible capture—is felt in the intensifying broadcast. Only a slight over-reliance on abstract “tyranny of indifference” keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied—cold brass anchor, dread clench—yet the inherited duty remains abstract; the “scent of rain” cue is evocative but doesn’t tilt a present micro-choice. His lone action (playing negative space) is consistent and costly, but the contradiction between nostalgia and duty is stated more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete (tangible soil stains, mossy delight) and Elian’s single micro-choice—the fingertip prod—compresses everything he is (tender order) and forecloses his quiet anonymity. Minor over-articulation of “consuming motivation” once prevents the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—his “quiet tick of broken things” and the slow heartbeat of a grandfather clock—but the decisive pivot from collector to participant in uncertainty is more asserted than embodied; the final beat lacks a visible cost on Elias’s body or psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—grief vs. alchemical discipline—drives every beat; the embodied cost (sweat, drained energy) makes the final renunciation feel earned. The coin’s transformation is the visible price that forecloses resurrection, sealing his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his tactile use of the crocodile tooth anchors him in the living world—but the spirit’s shift from agony to laughter is slightly too smooth; a sharper contradiction in Silas’s own fear would have pushed this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his hyper-awareness and disorientation is dramatized through micro-choices (grip on strap, ankle angle). Motivation crystallizes in the final beat: “mathematics of mercy” becomes an active quest. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV arc earns credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cool, familiar weight” of the lens), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the final act of “unfastening” feels inevitable yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s childlike motive (“what ceilings hide”) is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—headlamp beam, ladder screech, brass cylinder—showing a hierarchy of values under spectral pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the dead’s secret intact) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the ghost’s calm dissipation. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. One hairline slip: “weightless burden” is slightly self-diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Operator’s interiority is spare yet consistent: “precise and economical” motion, the hand on the cold press at the end. Motive—compress eternity—drives every micro-choice (uncorking, tracing frost). The final renunciation (perfect system lost) carries visible conceptual cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is textured and embodied (“burnished sorrow,” “aging fingers”), and his contradictory impulses—defeated yet rekindled—are dramatized through the micro-choice of lifting the shard at the end. The final smile carries visible cost: he recommits to a fight he may still lose. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his self-doubt embodied in the cooling chip—and his micro-choice to embrace “tinkertoy joy” over grandeur earns the final chord. The single POV keeps focus tight, though the rust-voice antagonist is off-stage, limiting relational crucible. Motivation (“reclaim the light”) is dramatized, not told, and the cost—his near-failure under the lie—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s eccentricity is embodied in her scent-cataloguing and psychometry, but the final renunciation—“to understand its impossibility”—is stated more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully embodied in a micro-choice on the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from artist to custodian is earned through micro-choices under pressure. The driftwood-as-language insight crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she is soaked, shivering, and her former purpose is foreclosed. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Flaw-driven struggle (learning vs. knowing) complicates the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her artist’s eye and quiet obsession feel lived-in. The contradiction between her public color and private search is dramatized through action (weeks of patient observation, lantern choreography). The final recognition of her great-grandmother lands with visible cost—she steps out carrying the “dawning hush” as new weight. Minor slip: “quietly driven” is stated more than enacted until late.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the burn of the reverie”), but the story withholds any on-page choice that alters tactics; the final coordinate is given rather than seized. Motivation is clear, yet the absence of a decisive act keeps the arc just shy of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his refusal of “false comfort” is dramatized through the deliberate choice to use memory rather than illusion. The contradictory pull between exhaustion and resolve is palpable in “the profound exhaustion of a god on the second day of creation.” Micro-choices (placing the bottle, selecting sensory fragments) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—accepting lifelong labor—earns its cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between archival oath and emergent duty to make the city forget is dramatized through the micro-choice to test the shaving. The final renunciation—“his duty was now to the people”—lands with felt cost, though the shift from observer to actor could be foreshadowed one beat earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“furiously tranquil” is dramatized in her deliberate pulse and patient gathering of memory-threads. Motivation (to feel borrowed time) is clear and paid off in the final sensory image. The single micro-choice—inviting chaos into the acorn cap—earns the closure with visible cost: the vortex’s wildness is stilled yet preserved. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s quiet curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing resonance, finding the rope) and culminates in a costly renunciation; the final silence carries felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s quiet yearning and embodied ritual with the glass anchor his arc; the climactic empathy beat crystallizes his internal contradiction—custodian vs. seeker—earning the resonant renunciation of isolation. Micro-choices (pressing glass to eyepiece, tracing with soul) are specific and costly. Minor: “spiritually curious” edges toward label, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's decade-long silence is embodied and costs: every tight-throated swallow, every ghost-directed micro-choice is idiosyncratic and ties directly to renunciation in the final beat. Internal contradiction—guard the words vs free the ghosts—drives two visible reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied (“thinning of the light within his own bones”), but the final beat leans on a summary epiphany rather than a visible, costly choice; the urn fragment anchors motive yet the shift to “suddenly timeless” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “clean, simple pain” and the feather’s tactile handling reveal motive. Yet the final renunciation—slipping the feather into pocket—feels slightly under-costed; no prior beat shows him resisting the urge to comfort the child, so the choice reads as aesthetic rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused finger on vellum, “brazen calm” that unsettles the doctor. Motivation (interspecies communion) is rooted in lifelong observation and intensifies under the six-month deadline. The final renunciation—sinking against the pillar, matching breath to the new rhythm—earns its cost through prior grafting labor. Minor slip: “six months” is told, not dramatized, but the embodied payoff compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Coachman’s quiet atonement is embodied in seed-by-seed choices; interior contradiction between resignation and micro-striving is invited but not enacted on the page, so the final renunciation (tomorrow’s return) feels credibly poised rather than tested. Emotion is sensuous and grounded; “quiet atonement” tell pulled back by tactile ritual. Earned through steady choices rather than visible flaw clash, limiting band entry for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for constancy while sensing temporal flux—is embodied in the charcoal grit and the jacket’s ozone scent; the final renunciation of the compass rose as “quaintly simplistic” is earned by the prior stretch of perception and carries visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—reverence vs audacity—are embodied in the climb and the silent swap; the final “soul lighter” crystallizes a credible renunciation. Motivation (“embrace the unknown”) is dramatized, not stated, and the cost is the relinquishment of any tangible prize. Interiority is vivid, e.g., “cold weight of its captured history.” Minor slip: Sylas’s awe is reported rather than inhabited, keeping the relationship one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—ex-crisis performer now mining genuine grief—drives every micro-move and justifies the final three-step imperative. Emotional embodiment is visceral (tears carving grime maps) and the moment she ‘lets the mask drop’ carries explicit cost under Regent surveillance. The Regent’s façade fracture feels earned through Elara’s sustained non-verbal pressure and the shared silence after the obsidian board. Final stance choice—silent historian rather than queen—cements it as credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (“the thunder in her chest”), and her micro-choices (shelving, feather touch) align with motive. The buried-talent arc resolves in earned stasis—she foregoes nightly escape for rooted presence—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt and need for absolution are embodied in every micro-choice—his slow fingers on the labyrinth, the way he maps threads to chess moves. The interior contradiction (glory vs. safety) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final acceptance of his flaw carries visible cost in the town’s sudden motion and his own “quiet, aching relief.” Only the prince remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; the ghost functions as internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet fearing capture—drives every micro-choice; the final poem is a costly renunciation that forecloses her freedom. Kael’s brief presence adds relational pressure that tightens her resolve. Motivation stays rooted in artistic identity, never drifting into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict flashes in key beats—the coral’s weight between memory and doubt during the last scar—but therapy-speak intrudes (“grief-tainting the chronicle”) and her shift feels more narrated than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive (private grieving ritual) is clear early and intensifies to the final act; interiority (“memory so close it walled him off”) is sharp and embodied. The contradictory impulse to both carry and relinquish the memory is dramatized across beats and resolves with visible cost in the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interior contradiction and embodiment run deep—his “screaming tenderness” is palpable in micro-choice (pressing the vial, risking Hemlock’s wrath). Causality holds: his belief in quiet guiding costs him physical effort and social exposure. The final reticence is earned withheld emotion rather than tidy epiphany. Slight label-slip “raw need” keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s grief for his daughter is embodied in the censer foot’s weight and the moonlit hum; his micro-choice to slot the bronze into the cradle crystallizes a renunciation—he builds a path for others he cannot take himself. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in body or voice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s compulsion to absolute honesty is embodied in the painful bartering for the eye and the final withheld truth; the micro-choice to press the relic to his temple crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The cost—three kilos of truffles and the quiet severance of memory—lands on the page. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The ending’s earned stasis (he can now keep Lena private) is rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “calloused palm,” the “hollow space” after the stranger vanishes—but the final renunciation (placing the flower on the shelf) is more gesture than crucible; the cost is felt yet not dramatized through a micro-choice that alters his next watch. Still, the borrowed-memory conceit gives his solitude a second skin, and the contradiction between duty and compulsion is sustained to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-anchored promise and empirical intuition are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing ants, holding the chip). The final renunciation—lowering the chip and walking away—earns its cost through prior causal beats and visibly unknotted grief. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “empirically intuitive” is stated once rather than dramatized throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for escape vs duty—drives every beat; the final renunciation carries visible cost. Kael’s single intervention crystallizes her choice without stealing focus. One reflective block is anchored in present action and tilts her stance. No slips in motivation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior motive (capture presence density) is embodied in tactile micro-choices; the contradiction between sterile calculus and messy living desire forces the decisive beat. Kael’s presence supplies credible interpersonal pressure, and his departure catalyzes costly renunciation. Small drag: one moment when Elara “thought of equations” summarises rather than feels. Overall, flawed alchemist is vivid and costly, but not unprecedented.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator's jealous hunger for past selves is palpable and specific (“obscene hope”), and the closing shift from envy to cartographic awe is earned through embodied cost (the actual loss of nostalgic agony). Interior contradiction between chronicler and resentful observer surfaces in micro-choices: abandoning fantasy maps, then resuming them on new terms. The arc stops just short of a full 9-band because the cost—trading longing for perspective—is articulated more emotionally than concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her scent-loss is rendered through tactile compensations. The screw-reading beat shows contradictory impulses: fear of inadequacy vs. need to give comfort. Micro-choice—handing back the screw—forecloses her old life with felt cost. Secondary pressure from the old man is minimal but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is intimate and specific; crystalline malady embodied and costly. Memory of grandmother is leveraged as micro-choice catalyst, motivating the abandonment of scholarly tools, credible within character logic. Final renunciation is visible—quill as stylus, whispered naming—not merely stated. Slight distance kept from deeper flaw cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Julian’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. self-preservation—are embodied in the trembling grip on the perfume bottle and the gasped apology. Madame Vex’s velvet-and-razor persona is vivid, but her interiority is withheld, keeping her a functional catalyst rather than a second crucible. The final acceptance is earned by the prior sensory deluge, with visible cost in the fading lilac and the distant chainsaws.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“she felt the truth of it in the air”), but the Witness’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied—his ritual countdown, the tactile key, the moment he “lets out a slow breath” all reveal a man whose flaw is obsessive precision yet whose final renunciation is earned. The contradiction between shepherd-as-tamer and shepherd-as-witness is dramatized in the micro-choice to leave the ice shard untouched. Cost is visible: he forfeits the illusion of control. Only the grandfather’s aphorism edges toward label-speak, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is specific—“quiet wildfire” registers the grief-driven obsession without diagnostic therapy-speak. The thumb-polished laser pointer shows tactile fixation, and releasing the button costs him the last visceral hold on “her shape.” Contradictory pull between security instinct and desire to open permeable exit is dramatized rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—logic vs. intuition—are embodied in the tactile handling of the lantern and the subway scrawls; her final micro-choice (lighting the candle) renounces zero-risk living with felt cost. Interiority is specific to her probabilistic lens. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “widened her perspective responsibly.”

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s interiority is consistent and embodied (the “delicate architecture” of estrangement), but the story withholds any contradictory impulse; his motivation is stated rather than tested under pressure. The caller’s arc is credible, yet Silas remains a fixed catalyst—effective for theme, but the lack of visible cost to him caps the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “gentle thoroughness” is dramatized in the risky steeping of the photograph. The final choice to walk the jetty and share the locket is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost. Tomas appears only at the end, so relationship crucible is limited, but Elara’s solitary arc is coherent and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s loneliness is embodied and specific, but the shift from passive observer to catalytic participant is compressed into a single off-stage decision (“Slipping out a side door”). The cost of his loneliness is felt, yet the micro-choice that commits him is summarized rather than dramatized, blurring the final motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s sensory mapmaking and grief absorption show contradictory impulses acting in scene; climax choice is earned with felt silence-as-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the urge to edit—are embodied in micro-choices (tracing the pen, frantic console work, deliberate unbending). The final renunciation costs him the fantasy of absolution and is earned by the preceding cascade of failed edits. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The dried pen as relic and mirror of identity is handled with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his ritualistic movements and invented sign-language reveal a singular, obsessive mind. The memory of Lyra functions as a contradictory impulse, urging him “deeper” while he simultaneously grieves her absence. His final renunciation—leaving the now-singing harbor—carries visible emotional cost. Only the “quietly charismatic” label remains ornamental, never constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s rage vs curator’s tenderness—are embodied in micro-choices (torch vs brush) and crystallize in the final renunciation. The sister’s absence is rendered through tactile objects and pattern recognition, not exposition. One slip: “volcanic heat cooling into resolve” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—grief braided into marrow—embodies motive and cost; her drumming micro-choices tighten the stake. The final Earned Stasis (lonely duet) forecloses reunion with visible emotional cost. Only a hairline slip: “haunting” edges diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s quiet competence and Kaelen’s hollow bluster are sharply contrasted; the final refusal to gloat crystallizes Silas’s value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“the silence was a relief”). Cost is visible in Kaelen’s stripped arrogance and the whispered authority Silas earns.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied ("cold ache that resonated"); traits shape choices (patience, empathy). Endurance closure—“to teach darkness the value of stars”—is rooted in prior portrayal, cost visible in the lone sliver kept open. Absence of other characters removes relational crucible; only minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “static-filled broadcast” of fear, the tactile cradling of the stone—but the final shift in Maya’s mind is reported rather than dramatized through his senses, blurring the cost he pays. Motivation is consistent and intensifies, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s longing is embodied in his fluid motion and the whalebone’s weight; Elara’s “combative tenderness” is dramatized in stance and plea. The final renunciation—Kaelen stepping onto the rising island while Elara stays—carries a palpable relational cost. Interior contradiction (cage vs. home) is active in scene, not summary. Minor slip: “nature isn’t here” edges toward label-speak but is quickly grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—performing joy while grieving—are embodied in the staged tea ritual and private whittling; the final placement of the bird in Mara’s bouquet crystallizes a cost (survivor’s guilt) that forecloses easy absolution. Interiority is specific, tactile, and unflinchingly self-accusatory. The micro-choice to hide the bird inside the dead bouquet is earned by prior guilt and changes the emotional valence of the shrine. Moral ambiguity is not asserted but dramatized in the contrast between his frozen face and her punishment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“shivering not from cold but from a profound quietude”—and his aesthetic compulsion is dramatized through the micro-choice to dissolve boundaries. The final renunciation of external interpretation carries visible cost: he forfeits the safety of literal translation and accepts the risk of madness. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s color-blind painter identity is embodied in every perception; his “innocently cunning” trait drives the pivotal reed-tongue solution. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory—he both reveres Vex’s color and cannot read it. The final choice to trade his sight for her skill crystallizes a visible cost: Lyra wakes, the moonflower opens, and Elian claims a wordless masterpiece. Minor slip: Vex’s interiority is filtered through Elian’s gaze, slightly softening her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from “hearing” to “seeing” sound is dramatized through tactile micro-choices. The final renunciation—accepting silence as light—carries visible cost in the glowing bell. Minor: the “powerfully gentle” trait is asserted more than tested until the final adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-to-purpose arc is embodied in tactile micro-choices (polishing, folding, projecting) and culminates in a visible cost: surrendering the tattoo stencil itself. The woman’s minimal presence still functions as crucible; her first spoken words crystallize the shared loss and validate Elias’s risk. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak. One minor slip: “teach withering to bloom” leans label, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her “steadily curious hand” and the way she “unspooled” the tape show embodied motive. The father’s legacy supplies a credible, non-generic drive that tightens her final stance. Julian’s presence is brief but functional, forcing her to articulate the cost of her obsession. The only gap: Julian’s own arc is sketched rather than tested, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between scholarly detachment and ecstatic surrender is dramatized in her micro-choices. The final renunciation—becoming the vessel—carries visible cost (“exquisite, unbearable clarity”). Minor slip: “anguished joy” is named rather than fully embodied in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is precise and embodied—his noticing of Elara’s micro-gesture shift is character-specific. The contradiction between love and curatorial detachment drives every beat. The final integration choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Only the “sole curator” label feels slightly generic, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s compassion/anger duality is vividly embodied in micro-choices (tail-fitting scene); interiority balances empathy and pride, then crystallizes into Earned Stasis when he refuses bitterness. Decision to restore tail reconfigures both creature and own sense of decency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between seeking closure and reopening wounds is dramatized in the tunneling beat. The final renunciation—“to carry them”—is earned by the preceding psychic cost and the ivy’s withdrawal. Minor slip: the phrase “final, perfect closure” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory ache to “find where unused love is stored” drives every beat. The micro-choice to push deeper into Arthur’s memory crystallizes her stance and costs her breath, earning the closure. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One hairline slip: “a strange and aching one” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied aftermath rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for silence yet addicted to the instrument that records the sky—drives every micro-choice; the final shift from tracing stars to sketching faces is earned by the prior revelation that “the unspoken words were the cries of celestial matter.” The psychic burden is embodied in brass-stained fingers and the “crushing static,” not labeled. One flaw: the epiphany (“remembered stardust”) arrives as pure insight rather than through an on-page test, slightly softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—dreamless yet aching for the forest through memory—is embodied in the pine-resin intrusion and micro-choice to braid rather than erase. The closing beat earns the "beginning of a dream" by visible cost: surrender of strict erasure and birth of the crystalline-tree, which crystallizes a lifetime stance without tidy resolution. One slip: the phrase "fractured lullaby whispered to a feverish child" edges on therapy-speak label, but the immediate embodied cost absorbs the damage.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the gear’s tactile presence anchors identity. The final shift from “stray” to “guided” is earned through sensory ordeal and costs the comfort of ignorance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied (“hollow ache in the air”) and her micro-choice to stand and follow is credible, but the guides remain ornamental; their calm lacks pressure that would force her to reveal contradictory impulses. The final step is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interior ambivalence (voice–loss vs guilt) is embodied and drives every move until the final withholding-of-forgiveness. Yet the soloist remains off-stage; the promised ‘secondary pressure’ becomes a mute sign rather than a resisting agent, blunting escalation and thus capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is spare yet specific—his “regally unpretentious” weariness is embodied in the silent brush of a child-sized hand across cracked vellum. Motive (restore balance, not vengeance) is stated early and drives every micro-choice; the final dissolution carries visible cost as the library—and the titan—fade. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s grief-anchored obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—drumming, map-tracing, slumping—yet the interior contradiction between scientific detachment and desperate hope stays vivid. The final renunciation (accepting cyclical memory instead of permanent recovery) is earned and carries visible cost: the reef’s resurrection lasts only a minute. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (reef memory) is ≤20 % and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and inherited opera glasses crystallize her lineage and motive; the shift from awkward to virtuoso is embodied in the hum’s crescendo. The final stance—standing charged with planetary resonance—earns its cost in the burned-out bay and her solitary vigil. Minor slip: “awkwardly confident” is asserted more than dramatized until the hum begins.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—reverence for the embryo and defiance of the regime—co-exist in the same beats. The final choice to unseal is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the amber dissolves, the embryo is irreversibly launched. One minor slip: “accidental telepathy” is stated rather than dramatized, slightly undercutting the gift’s credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Anya’s contradictory impulses—care for the past via photograph vs. care for the present plant—are embodied and felt in scene. Micro-actions (locked hand, spasmed fingers, eventual watering) reveal cost. The only minor dent is slight therapeutic phrasing around ‘somatic markers’; otherwise motive to action is clear and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—wanting to descend into darkness yet yearning for coherence—drives every micro-choice; the shift from portraitist to cartographer is embodied in charcoal-black fingers and a quiet re-weighing of pain. The ache’s transformation from hollow absence to “gentle, knowing glow” is earned by the tactile redesign of the box fragments. No stock therapy-speak; the flaws remain, but their cost is accepted in the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—serene anger versus cold purpose—remains embodied and specific; the micro-choice to abandon rescue for the ink ritual crystallizes his hierarchy of values. His red eyes narrowing to slits and chalk-pale skin reacting to light are vivid, character-bound details. The final renunciation (stepping into the pattern) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he is written out of existence. Flaws (solitary obsession) complicate choices and foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—archival duty vs. moral revulsion—is dramatized in concrete micro-choices (the trembling fingers, the bypass of main servers). The final act of betrayal is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the “pang of profound betrayal.” Minor slip: “bravely conflicted” is label-speak that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between nurturing hands and inherited violence is dramatized in the knife moment. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “senselessly perceptive” leans label-speak, though it is quickly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s calm-as-stone patience and grief-driven quest are embodied in every micro-choice—humming counter-frequencies, tapping the spike, enduring the goddess’s sorrow. The final renunciation (walking away with memory-laden iron) forecloses further pursuit and carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celeste’s contradictory impulses—protecting her father’s memory while dismantling the journalist’s lie—are dramatized in the phone call and the handling of the nib. The final renunciation (public vindication at private cost) is earned by the causal chain of proofs. Minor slip: “devotedly observant” is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s guilt-driven ritualism is embodied in every micro-choice; the contradiction between map-maker and father is dramatized through the act of etching Lyra onto metal. Interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with cost. The final renunciation—turning guilt into memorial—earns its hush.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—paint-stained fingers, lilac unease, reading shoulders like paragraphs. The contradictory impulse (whimsy vs. despair) is present but never forces a micro-choice that costs her; the mandala is a foregone act. The final renunciation of speech for pattern is earned, yet the cost is diffuse—felt more by the onlookers than by her knees in sand. Still, she reads as an individual, not a trope.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—empathy vs. annihilation of memory—is embodied in the tactile ritual; the cost (hollow ache, ghost departure) is felt. The Retro’s passivity limits relationship-as-crucible, but Kaelen’s micro-choice hierarchy is clear. Motivation stays rooted and intensifies to the renaming beat. One slip: “retrocognitively trapped” is label-speak mid-peak (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Julian’s longing for an encore is palpable and consistent; his synesthetic perception is embodied in concrete sensory choices rather than labels. Elara’s despair is shown through embodied action (tears, coin stroking) and her shift is earned by the ghost’s escalating echoes. The final renunciation—choosing not to flip the coin—carries visible emotional cost. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. ache to believe—drives every micro-choice; the final intertwining of pulses crystallizes a credible renunciation of pure logic with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's contradictory impulses are dramatized through sensory mapping decisions that alter tactics under pressure; interiority is embodied and her final renunciation costs her physical anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—duty vs. hope—is embodied in the tactile ritual of button-sorting; the burn-scarred toggle crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Motivation escalates cleanly from obedience to agency, though the absence of embodied emotion in the final beat keeps it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—cowardice versus reclaimed courage—is embodied in the pillbox and the scuffed snow; the final choice to “run toward” is earned by the Vienna flashback and Kestrel’s intel. Micro-choice: memorizing then erasing the map shows a hierarchy of values. The cost—leaving safety to rescue the colleague—feels scaled to the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the needle anchors a credible shift from guilt to distilled compassion. The promise’s re-weighting is earned through micro-choices (slipping the needle away) rather than exposition. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Interior contradiction and cost are legible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s quiet, embodied curiosity (“potter’s intuition”) and the micro-choice to water the rose anchor interiority; the final act of rebuilding the channel crystallizes his arc with visible cost (clay under nails, nightfall). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her father’s locksmith legacy, the rosebush as daily greeting, the “wistfully pragmatic” sigh—yet the decisive choice to lower the tooth feels slightly under-motivated; we see the inherited creed but not the fresh trigger that makes tonight the night. The embodied emotion (salt-laced air, gentle engine of her arm) is vivid, and the micro-choice to keep the rhythm after the blinds twitch shows earned change with cost—her fatigue and continued vigil. Still, Mr. Henderson remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet clinging to solitude—is embodied in the micro-choice to place the sundial and lean into the hum. The shift from “cage” to “reservoir” is earned by the stone-circle ordeal, with the cost of permanent solitude made legible in the final image. No stock phrasing; voice stays particular and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—archivist of others’ hearts yet emotionally hollow—drives every beat; the spiral’s release is a credible renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“quiet ache,” “gentle, invisible tug”) is specific, though a few phrases edge toward label-speak. Micro-choice of wedging the nest is decisive and irreversible. Secondary characters are off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“familiar knot of dread,” “exhausted ache”), motives escalate from observation to interference, and the final choice carries visible cost. The cosmic tricksters remain off-page, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A; the single POV is well-realized.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is embodied in the tightening chest and the “infinite, dark throat,” and his prudence shows in the measured grip on the compass. The contradiction between fear and need drives every beat, culminating in the decisive transfixion that reconfigures space and self. Interiority is concrete and specific; no stock labels intrude. The final cost—loss of the Architect’s physical key, gain of conceptual one—lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s prosopagnosia and artistic compulsion are embodied in every micro-choice; the final scratch is earned by the ritualized process. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The ache at the end is a credible cost, though the shift from selfish quest to felt sorrow could be even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s idealism and ancestral guilt are embodied in tactile micro-choices (thumb on nail, trembling hand at rock). The copper nail’s evolution from memento to key crystallizes his contradictory impulses—honor vs. dread—under rising pressure. Final decision to broadcast carries visible social cost. Minor slip: “nervously confident” is asserted more than dramatized until the drone launch.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “luminous disbelief” is embodied in the trembling bow and the glass shard cutting his palm. Motivation crystallizes in the final paragraph: the leap from passive observer to active composer of possibility is earned by the vanishing and the mesh-code. Micro-choice (playing the flutter-rhythm) is on-page and costly—he abandons his old repertoire. Flaw is implied: lifelong acquiescence to “never,” now confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his nightly ritual with the foreign notes embodies the inherited dread without exposition. The shift from passive observation to active territorial marking shows a credible micro-choice that forecloses violence. The final renunciation (“stepped outside of it”) is earned by the prior causality of watching both father and startup devour themselves. Only the CEO’s flat antagonism keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s generational obsession and tactile rituals (telegram, eyepiece) anchor motivation; the embodied tremor when writing the final translation shows earned cost. Interior contradiction—duty to decode vs. acceptance of un-decodable grief—plays out in real time. Micro-choice to surrender to dream-witness rather than control it crystallizes values. Still, secondary pressure from absent grandfather remains off-page, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guarded nature is embodied in her ritual discipline and the fortress metaphor; the final unbending of her heart is earned by the prior psychic cost of breaching the vortex. Interiority is specific—her “warlike serenity” cracks under the exact pressure of straightening the branch. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “she felt her own guarded nature cracking,” but the embodied cost of pouring life-force compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—sap-slow blood, anxious elation—yet the root-bound body never constrains a visible micro-choice; the final path is discovered, not enacted. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the cost is psychic, not embodied. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s interiority is embodied and specific—soil-stained fingers, the “leering ghoul” on the card—but the contradiction between reckless idealism and fierce gentleness is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to offer the memory is credible yet slightly under-costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—detached appraiser vs. haunted roadie—surface in the tactile struggle with the grille cloth; the final micro-choice to place the scrap on the desk crystallizes his renunciation of total detachment with visible emotional cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids therapy-speak. Motivation to find value after loss is dramatized through handling objects, not stated. Flaw (emotional insulation) complicates the choice and is neither excused nor fully healed.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s inner contradiction—grueling grief versus scientific drive—propels every choice; her embodied precision in the garden and the final seed ritual crystallize a compelling, earned arc of collapse into inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelan shifts from Archivist to Smelter and back, with genuine interior contradiction—empathy must weaponize heat, identity liquefies and recasts—but the cost is felt more as an abstract shimmer than a singular, readable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’ interior contradiction—certifier of walls vs. clandestine tear-down artist—drives every beat; the pearl-touch is the earned culmination of that split, paying off with felt cost and luminous regret.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—methodical mapping vs. raw grief—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (finger on map, accordion sigh). The final renunciation of the accordion earns its cost through prior causality, though the interiority flirts with therapy-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (hope vs dread) play out in micro-choices—clicking the watch, repositioning in mist, trembling transcription. The final “Stay” lands as earned renunciation with visible cost: the dissolving library and stilling watch foreclose return. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to empire vs. the vine’s truth—are embodied in trembling hands and the decisive cut of the vine. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the mulberry ache layers grief, complicity, and nascent hope. The final micro-choice (taking the cutting) renounces prestige with visible cost: “an act of treason far greater than any forged document.” Character arc earns its Earned Stasis under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (reverence vs. detachment) surface in the micro-choice to tighten her grip on the emerald. The final renunciation—letting the soul vanish while preserving its spark—carries visible cost in the gentling aurora. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation remains singular and intensifies to the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the obsidian hairpin as tactile conduit to ancestral memory is deft. The shift from passive observer to active participant is earned through the forgiveness backstory and crystallizes in the scalloping beat. Minor slip: “contentment was the quiet resonance” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s tremor, the unhooking of the cloak, and the envelope of cash all embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the conscience-for-hire’s own motivation remains slightly abstract, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—desire to appear vs. inability to let go—is embodied in the tightening of his tunic and the stone-pond trance. Elara’s reversed-aging life is shown through her “ancient eyes” and the cost of passing knowledge forward, not told. The final micro-choice—Kael’s quiet “I see”—earns the renunciation of his anchor with visible cost. One slip: “drowning in your own wake” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelan’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the arrowhead’s pulse is felt in palm and psyche. The reverent trait constrains the search method and earns the final act of mercy. Micro-choice—humming the arrowhead home—pays the cost of opening the first true path out. One slip: centuries of listening is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for the sacred while shackled to technomantic metrics—is embodied in the diagnostic failures and the decisive shedding of his pack. The final micro-choice (bare palm on stone) crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost: he forfeits institutional validation. Interiority is specific, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“a poet forced to write legal code”) nudges it short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is embodied and specific—his ritual of “lighting the pier for tourists” versus the hidden pilgrimage, the brass tag as tactile obsession, the deliberate dive as micro-choice under pressure. The vow to “see her music” is dramatized, not stated, culminating in the indigo bloom behind closed eyes. Cost is felt: ten years of silence, the physical risk of the dive, the irreversible knowledge that the promise is kept. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his “quiet enthusiasm” and “stellar doubt” are embodied in micro-choices like clutching the coin pouch. The final renunciation of future-seeking for past-curation is earned by prior obsession with resonance. Flaw: the contradictory impulse (prophet vs. madman) is stated more than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s grief is embodied in the dust motes, the prism, the crystal—never stated. The contradictory impulse to “anchor an echo” rather than sever a soul is dramatized in the final beat, with visible cost: the shard is a scar, not a cure. Interiority is precise, character-bound, and drives the single decisive act. Only the “nameless fear” line edges toward label-speak, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s ‘lukewarm’ limitations and stubbornly ingenuous belief are embodied in his exhausted slumps and painstaking drip adjustments; the final weary smile shows both cost and fidelity to the only trait that matters—naïveté. Motivation remains a single track, so no internal contradiction or secondary pressure is evident.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from dutiful warden to obsessed historian is dramatized through tactile choices (mud-sucked boots, archive nights). The final act of correction carries visible moral cost and is rooted in contradictory impulses—duty to truth versus loyalty to grandfather’s tale—earned across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—icy logic vs. hidden sentiment—drives every beat; the locket reveal and flame choice crystallize cost. Embodied emotion (“cold and sharp frustration,” “hands suddenly steady”) anchors the shift. The final renunciation of pure reason is earned by prior causality and felt in the sublimation image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his tremor, the buckle’s bite, the ghost of the rip-cord—but the “preserve trust” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The muscle-memory sequence is a sharp micro-choice that earns the steady hand, yet the prior debt to “those who slept” remains abstract. Still, the contradiction between duty and panic is palpable, and the cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s contradictory push-pull between hollowing numbness and the ghost-memory of love drives every micro-choice; the embodied “drain” and his final intake of breath give physical cost to a purely internal arc. The scene’s only other character, Jin, exerts palpable ideological pressure that forces Kael to act rather than argue. No stock phrases—interiority runs through tactile images (“hollow core,” “phantom limb of an emotion”). Final stance crystallizes: renunciation of the old self with a newborn consciousness now tethered to him—irrevocable responsibility replaces numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “deep, resonant curiosity” and deliberate ritual of planting anchor his arc. The contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. caution) play out in micro-choices (examining, cross-referencing, planting). The final renunciation—accepting a decade-long commitment—carries visible cost. Only the “notably receptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mourning ghost-mentor’s contradictory impulses—yearning vs. spectral limitation—drive every choice; embodied sorrow steers the final “macerate” beat to shred accumulated grief with leaf-blower wind and lullaby melody. Cost arrives as the wife’s half-smile, proving the haunting succeeded at the price of admitting his own absence. Flaw retained and paid: he remains dead, voice only noise, love only memory.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyel’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home vs. duty to the garden—are embodied in the pendant’s temptation and the final refusal. The interiorized ache is specific and non-generic, and the renunciation carries visible cost: he seals the portal with his own longing. Minor slip: “dimensionally homesick” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet, stoic exterior vs. frantic interior is embodied in the soot-sweeping ritual and the tear he collects; the shift from command to surrender is a credible renunciation with visible cost—the last fragment of the crozier is gone forever.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied dread, tactile handling of the fragment, and the micro-choice to invert gain anchor her arc. The “find the beginning in every ending” motive is dramatized through her three discarded assumptions, each paid for with rising system strain. Cost is felt in the tower’s groan and the near-overload of her console, making her final smile earned. Flaw: the mentor echo is summary, not embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Finn’s resilient optimism is embodied in micro-choices—moving toward the bridge, steady hands on the radio—yet interiority stays surface-level; the final “permanent transient” stance is earned but lacks deeper contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thread tension, color shift—yet the interior contradiction (seeking warmth, finding cold) is dramatized only once; the final hollowness is felt but not fully earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—duty to the city vs. hunger for the stars—is embodied in the anchor link and drives every beat. The final choice to “become the first link” is earned by the prior algorithmic work and the visible sorrow of leaving the seabed. Only minor drift: Director Valerius is off-page, so status dynamics are inferred rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s curiosity is embodied in his methodical tuning of the obsolete aid and his deliberate steps; the final “assure” action is a direct expression of his protective motive. Leo’s worry is viscerally shown through posture and breath, not labels. The cost—Elias’s quiet exit without acclaim—feels earned. Minor deduction for Leo’s worry being slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is embodied in sweat and breath, his grandmother’s memory drives every beat, and the final renunciation (letting her go) is earned by the childhood flashback and the physical ordeal. Interior contradiction is present—fear vs duty—though the shift from terror to calm feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s contradictory pulse/bureaucratic death feels tangible and tied to her final reframing of her erased life as space-to-grow; heartbeat counting embodies her quiet endurance and charges the earned stasis of closing “spaces between.” A micro-choice—the ink stroke that completes the void-chart—lands with visible cost: the ghost fragment ends, accepting the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s obsession with texture-to-sound translation is embodied in every micro-choice (climbing the bone tower, twisting the diamond). The final tone is the earned cost: he gains the first true word at the price of lifelong solitude. Interiority is specific—“copper-veined hands trembled”—never label-speak. One flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene; motivation is monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Julian’s bitterness-to-reverence arc is embodied in micro-choices (picking up, then setting down the arrowhead) and contradictory impulses (expose vs protect) that crystallize in the final beat. The sister-shaped hole in his motive stays palpable, but the shift from “monster” to “cosmic joke” lands cleanly. Minor: the “frostbitten hope” is named rather than embodied, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority stays fused to pulse and physical action; her micro-choices—syncing heartbeat to bow—earn the final reawakening. Fear and hope layer credibly; no diagnostic self-speak. Slight slippage toward lyrical abstraction in final lines keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior ache and quiet sacrament of rebellion are embodied in the grit on his uniform and the hush before the upload; the micro-choice to uncork the bottle at the precise gap in drone sweeps crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The bluebird confirmation gives a felt cost—he has spent the storm and must ride away lighter, promise kept yet still searching. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “calloused hands” warming to the fragment, the “rusty and yet achingly clear” note he releases. Motivation is consistent: silence as possibility drives every micro-choice. The final act of singing is earned by the slow accumulation of craft and solitude; the cost is the decade of silence he breaks. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet obsession and tactile ritualism ring true; the scarf-touch beats show embodied memory, and the closing smile sells a credible micro-renunciation. Interior stakes stay intimate, yet the final Charged Poise feels proportionate to the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “heart hammered against his ribs” at the prismatic fog—but the contradiction between obsessive pursuit and quiet contentment at the end is asserted more than dramatized; still, the final renunciation of further chase carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Locksmith’s interiority is spare but coherent; his quiet resolve and the single, embodied act of humming under starlight reveal motive without exposition. The mother’s grief is sketched through gesture and reaction rather than label, and the final awe is earned. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the 9+ gate is missed, yet the arc of liberation feels credible.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—lifelong detachment vs. the sudden need to touch—are dramatized in the final beats; the tremor, the claw-hand, the remembered “Elias” all embody cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing. The choice to break his own rule is earned by the prior thirty-year obsession and lands with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—mentoring Elara while retreating from his own failure—are embodied in his backward shuffle and trembling hands. Elara’s micro-choice to restack scrolls crystallizes her earned resilience. The mentor-student crucible shifts status: she becomes the caretaker, he the one exposed. Only the “reversible exile” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between duty and creative method is dramatized in the act of weaving wonder into the seed. The lineage backstory is anchored in a single reflective cue (“For generations…”) that tilts his present stance. The final renunciation—risking the seed’s unknown fate—carries visible cost as the greyness lifts and he feels the world’s restored pulse. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    MC's vocation of “restorer of broken masks” is beautifully embodied in the meticulous unraveling of knots; interiority is concrete, sensory, and contradictory (fear vs duty). The mentor/apprentice dynamic remains largely status-stabilized—Kaelen is a witness more than pressure—so relationship-as-crucible is only lightly felt. The final hand-off of the needle gives a micro-turn that crystallizes inheriting responsibility; cost is subtle but legible (trembling hand).

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s methodical curiosity and shielded openness are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—handling vellum, freezing film frames, annotating “threshold found.” The interior contradiction between her need to know and her empathy for the mapmaker’s silence is embodied in the final restraint: she does not repair the tear but marks it, paying the cost of leaving the unknown intact.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is precise and character-specific; the narrator’s analytic detachment under pressure is embodied in micro-choices like “pulse steady.” The final renunciation—leaving the globe—earns its cost through prior causality. Mortimer’s silent presence, however, remains ornamental and never pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “driftingly alert calm” and the tactile memory of Lyra anchor motivation. The micro-choice to encode her loneliness via graffiti is specific and costly, yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps him from full 9-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and embodied; the diary and goggles function as charged objects that re-weight his understanding. His micro-choice to keep the secret is earned and carries felt cost. The contradiction between public grief and private hope is dramatized rather than stated. Only the “warmly inquisitive” label remains ornamental, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—his grief is embodied in the act of cloud-naming, and the final renunciation of writing down “The Unbroken Spool” shows earned cost. The contradiction between scientific detachment and emotional need is dramatized, not stated. One minor slip: “quietly explosive” is named rather than enacted until the noctilucent cloud appears.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s face-blindness is woven into her tactile artistry and the coin-reading task; her renunciation of escape for the sky-mirroring act carries visible cost as the building groans. Interiority is embodied (“air tasted of ancient paper”) and choices track motive. The flaw drives the mistake of lingering, compounding final risk.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (kneeling, sketching, cross-referencing) and carries visible cost in solitude. The hopscotch revelation feels earned because his prior mapping attempts failed. However, the interior contradiction between “sociable isolation” and actual solitude is asserted rather than dramatized, and the final communion remains more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“driftwood nostalgia,” “quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs”), and her micro-choice to uncap the vial is credibly motivated by prior fragments and family legacy. The final image of “tired woman watching a miracle” crystallizes earned cost. Minor slip: the contradictory impulse between fear of failure and compulsion to repair is implied rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is thin; her “faith” is asserted rather than embodied. The ghost’s motivation is sketched but never tested in scene. Relationships among the survivors are declared (“family”) without micro-choices that show the crucible. Still, the final smile lands as earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile memory of the puppet, the “bruised awe” in his bones—yet the story withholds any contradictory impulse that would complicate his final surrender; the choice is pre-ordained rather than earned under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s weary resignation and stubborn spark are embodied in the micro-choice of assembling the beacon; the cracked nut at the end is a felt cost that forecloses his next rescue. Interiority is concrete (“felt the coming cold in his bones”), not abstract. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies under the frost clock. The single POV is coherent; no relationship crucible is required.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris’s grief and regret read as embodied; the foam revelation sharply crystallizes—but a touch of backstory exposition and drifting inner monologue dull the raw force of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—selling beginnings while doubting their source—drives every micro-choice; the final incision is credibly foreshadowed by his obsessive cartography of absence. Embodied emotion is precise (“cool and weightless” moonlight on skin). Cost is visible: the flawless tree is forever scarred, the library’s silence broken, his own innocence forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—chef vs. memory-taster, desire to soothe vs. need to subsume—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (tongue on fossil, hand on Warlord). The final renunciation of his own brittleness is earned by the prior cascade of absorbed grief, with visible cost in the vanished pavilion and the tactile absence of the Warlord’s stored remorse.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's interior motive 'bridges from silos' is viscerally present in every micro-choice (hooking the weight, layering code-lullaby-poetry), with earned cost in sweat and the 'quiet promise' of return. Limited scope restricts backstory, yet the single POV sustains tension between empathic openness and decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to preserve yet risking self-dissolution—are dramatized in the neural-lace sequence; the embodied cost (throbbing head, tear) seals the change. Interiority is concrete and helix-specific, but the “archeologist of abandoned dreams” tag edges toward label-speak, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s prism-mind and burdened purpose are embodied in micro-choices—tracing the doodle, aligning it with fungi, memorizing the equation—each action revealing hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction surfaces in the quiet fire he guards versus the threat it poses. The final renunciation (accepting lifelong guardianship) is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible cost in the extinguished vellum. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—imposing versus releasing melody—are embodied in her tactile choices with the porcelain insulator; the final renunciation of silence carries a felt cost in her chest, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelan’s interiority is textured—thumb on the worry-stone groove, embodied ache of magnetic hum—but the final renunciation (letting the stone fall) is slightly under-cued; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in body or choice, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s compulsion to capture silence feels deeply personal rather than a literary pose—his childhood memories seep in through the diary and calibrate every beat. Embodied interiority (“sun-warmed stone” memory) governs the micro-choice when he twists the dial past the safe numbers. The price is on the page: the unlocked diary remains unread, a small but tangible renunciation that costs him literal knowledge in exchange for shared silence. However, the internal contradiction of “taste colors” could have been intensified under final pressure to fully exploit the intuitively descriptive trait.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—olfactory genius vs. revulsion of her own goal—drives every beat; her renunciation of restless striving for “quiet partnership” costs her prior identity of obsessive mastery. Micro-choices (choosing inward still-point amid windstorm) embody these contradictions on the page. Flaw (over-sensitive nose) complicates rather than solves, creating raw physiological pain. End feels earned: her ambition rewired from conquest to harmony, not erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive is vivid and embodied; her refusal to “watch them die” drives every beat. Interiority is specific—she “allows herself” only the dampeners’ thrum, a tactile restraint that mirrors her desperation. The final choice to shear the shard carries visible cost: the arrow’s hum ceases, the droplets fall, and the hour ends. A hairline slip: the blight’s stakes are stated, not embodied in her body or orchard, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is precise—his obsession with wind signatures and the “terrible math” of catastrophe is embodied in micro-choices like re-angling sensors upward. The final renunciation—perfect foresight that arrives too late—carries visible cost in the “hollow victory” and the weight heavier than steel. Flaws (solitary hyper-focus) drive the mistake of ignoring skyward vectors until the patch forces pivot. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic perception, embodied calm, and the quiet fire of purpose—but the story never exposes a contradictory impulse that complicates his choice; he proceeds with serene certainty. The final renunciation of silence carries cost (the cavern’s hush is dissolved), yet the cost is external rather than personal, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—guardian turned self-dissector—is embodied in the white-knuckled grip on the flute case and the shift from hammer to needle. The final insight that harmony, not sealing, was the true duty lands with visible cost: the canyon’s silence now holds both grief and understanding. Micro-choices (kneeling, aligning driftwood, tentative first note) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession with the “mathematics” of grief is crisp and recursive, but the moment he pivots from observer to sentient engine is tell-dense, not dramatized; Anya remains thinly perceived. The embodied cost is present (he sheds her borrowed sorrow with deliberate speed), yet we glimpse little internal contradiction in Elias under pressure, so the re-contextualization registers more for Anya than for him.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is embodied and specific—shifting shale, pluming breath, tremoring fingers. The contradiction between his craving for routine and the wonder he finally accepts is dramatized in the sustained auroral beat. The earned renunciation of “jittery courier” identity carries visible cost: he now bears revelation, not just freight. Elara’s memory functions as pressure, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs. mystical hope—are embodied in the moment he kneels, prism in hand, and the cost of his proof is visceral. Interiority is concrete, not abstract; the “tremor in his gut” and the “empty, ringing void” anchor emotion in body. The final renunciation of poetic memory for brutal literalism is earned by every prior beat. Only minor slip: the phrase “truest of all” leans toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—preserve love vs. complete the tapestry—are dramatized in the falter/recommence beat; the final weaving severs memory with unmistakable embodied cost (“she was peacefully, completely alone”). Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—“calloused but careful,” “captured twilight”—and his bartered memories carry a palpable cost. The contradiction between gentle hands and brutal trade is dramatized in the final gesture, not summarized. One slip: the phrase “state caught precisely between understanding and confusion” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the momentary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—concrete sensory cataloguing, embodied chill, and the shard’s cold against skin—but the sister-memory is told more than dramatized, muting the contradictory pull between grief and duty. The final renunciation (redirecting the cascade) is earned and carries visible cost in the snapped silence, yet the withheld-truth motive never collides with an on-page opposing impulse, keeping the arc slightly one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas's quiet, protective compulsion is believable: embodied in "cold dread seized him" and micro-choice of sea glass vs wrench. Circle of stones at close makes change visible. Loneliness motif is over-articulated ("luminescent ache"); still, interiority is specific to reticent man of habit. Passes threshold for immediate print with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelan's manic laughter and embodied exhaustion anchor his interiority; the final chuckle that "the dawn was beginning to shape him" crystallizes a credible shift. Motivation is clear, but the lack of contradictory impulse mid-scene keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—dye-master perception refracted through a borrowed heart—and the final renunciation (to witness rather than solve) is earned. Yet the woman remains a luminous cipher; her only agency is to confirm the donor’s echo, so relationship pressure is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s quiet obsession with trees’ memories is embodied in every micro-choice—polishing the sextant, angling moonlight, slotting the shard—so his renunciation of “fixing” grief in favor of archiving it feels earned. The interior contradiction between custodial duty and private quest is palpable, though the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “shattered reflection” mind and “heavy cloak” duty anchor motivation. Micro-choices (tending plants, coaxing buds) reveal values and escalate stakes. The final renunciation—singing the song at personal cost—earns closure. Flaw: memory shards feel convenient rather than contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction is vividly embodied: Elias’s empathy and need for shelter clash in real-time when he “stays while leaving.” The final softening—and cost—of leaving the smoothed invitation under Elara’s lamp lands with prior motivation fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet, embodied grief and her tactile hoarding of the rye heel crystallize motive; the patrolman’s flicker of memory adds relational pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “tenuous absolution” is more asserted than dramatized—cost is felt but not fully embodied in a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is precise and embodied—“his breath fogging in the frigid air,” “fingers flew across the controls”—and his contradictory impulse (to preserve while knowing preservation is futile) drives every micro-choice. The final act of logging the frequency is a renunciation that costs him the last living trace of the Vow, a visible price that earns the closure. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic label-speak in “concept of selfless giving,” but it is brief and does not undercut the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (preserve family honor vs. record betrayal) play out in micro-choices. The final lie is earned by prior failures and carries visible social cost. Minor slip: “curiously steadfast” is stated rather than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s skepticism and taste-based detection are vivid, but her interiority stays mostly observational; the climactic “profoundly illuminated” shift is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—“I trace the world, not reveal it”—drives every beat; the charcoal dust under nails is an embodied anchor to his shame. His mnemonist gift constrains and burdens choice in the climax, justifying the score.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s yearning for lost candor is concrete and embodied—he pieces the map because honesty has become atmosphere. Interiority is vivid without cliché: “sweet poison on the recycled air,” “a quiet obsession he’d held for years.” Tactics shift under pressure: calligrapher to cultivator, a new identity forged with felt cost. Motive remains consistent but deepens into tangible reverence when he plants the Veritas seed; no slip of label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation—preserving wonder—remains consistent and embodied in every micro-choice; the final renunciation of the sculpture itself is earned and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, tied to sensory detail (“song thrumming against his palms”). The only minor slip is the absence of contradictory impulses under peak pressure; his focus reads as monolithic rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—machine nostalgia vs caretaker protocol—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing scratches, locking onto Elara’s courage). Final renunciation of static safety is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the dome’s perfect garden abandoned. Slight reserve: the “strangely organic warmth” label edges diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's curator persona drives every micro-choice; the silver-worn locket anchors his tactile ritual and moral compass, embodying internal conflict between reverence and intervention. Flaws are exposed under pressure—risking management wrath to protect community fabric—and the final renunciation (letting Mrs. Gable’s rings guide the garden) is earned through prior listening, not authorial fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's embodied motivation—encrypted vulnerability into strength—remains vivid; the moment she lifts the dice and accepts chance as surrender is earned. Earlier interiority is concrete (the lab as cage, the journal as ghost-reclamation). Missing: tangible trade-off or visible scar resulting from the choice—cost is felt but abstract and interior, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s pursuit of “where deleted memories go” is consistently rooted in intimate particulars (the leather-bound book, the humming salt cellar). His contradictory impulses—clinging to an unknowing wife against evidence of loss—are embodied in each micro-choice (setting the book on the slate, the invasive reach into the gravity pocket). The cost of retrieval (a single fragment, its warmth already fading) reads as earned and scaled to the length; he ends with not victory but a resolute “one memory at a time,” a credible endurance that forecloses despair.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “focused calm of a star about to fold” is character-specific—but the piece never lets us feel an internal contradiction; the prophecy’s threat stays abstract, so her choice to erase it costs her nothing we can see. The origami wing is handled, yet its emotional history or personal stake remains blank; she never risks failure or regrets the hush. Earned stasis is asserted (“work done until…”) rather than paid for in a visible forfeiture, so the arc feels competent but not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s obsession is vivid and embodied; her shift from passive learner to active “librarian of whispers” is earned. Elias’s dual nature (man/memory) is revealed through gesture and silence, not exposition. Interior contradictions—curiosity vs. comfort with lies—play out in the rooftop confrontation. The cost is the loss of the safe fiction she clung to.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs. longing—drives every beat; the embodied ache of “her presence so vivid it was an ache” anchors emotion. Micro-choice to push harder against the spire crystallizes values at cost. Minor slip: “ghostly resolve” leans label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete—shaking glove, stung lungs, and the paradox of “treason of compassion” animate his trait. Micro-choices (hovering thorn, one precise dot) reveal a hierarchy where absolution outweighs loyalty; the costly tremor after the act lands the earned stasis. No stock labels intrude; every bodily cue is character-locked. The contradiction “forgery of compassion” plays out in gesture, not speech.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is embodied and specific (“marrow of her bones,” “shard of glass in her heart”), and her contradictory impulses—yearning to understand vs. fear of the answer—drive every micro-choice. The final renunciation (no longer asking why, but finishing songs) is earned by the mother-memory and costs her the comfort of ignorance. Only the mother’s silence is told rather than dramatized, a minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“walls weep history,” “candlelight flickers against blue, million-year-old cold”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; the decisive act of weaving truth is dramatized more as ritual than as a charged micro-choice with visible cost. The boy’s smile and the man’s dissolution feel earned, yet Elara’s own flaw or renunciation is only implied, keeping her arc just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is specific and embodied—his tactile obsession with knots and whisk-tine precision feels lived-in—but his final whistle impulse stays observational; the moment of participation lacks an active trade-off or visible flaw at stake. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the climactic ‘connection’ remains more aesthetic than costly, so the arc reads as a beautiful suspension rather than a pressured crucible that forces a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s skeptical, methodical drive is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tweezers, patient reassembly, antenna climb). The final intuitive leap shows contradictory impulses—scientist vs myth-breaker—paid for by the vanishing shimmer: a quiet renunciation that costs the orchard its mystery. No interior clichés; motives stay anchored to observable action. Flaw: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—his loneliness, the weight of shepherd-prophet duty, and the contradictory pulls of the shadow-voices are embodied in the static hiss and the diamond stylus. The final choice to reject both spectral masters and call for human allegiance is earned by the map’s revelation and the cost of his isolation. However, the “ancient shadows” remain somewhat abstract, muting the flaw’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific ("sweet sorrow of being the sole witness"); the poet’s motive to translate lost voices into jars is dramatized through the act of capturing sounds. A single micro-choice—uncorking the jars in a ritual around the box—earns the closure with visible cost (the surrender of the captured sounds). No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “cold knot of dread” and “logical emotion” are dramatized through the excruciating vibrational matching. Motivation to protect the Siren’s Heart is clear and drives every beat. The final slump and cataloging of the frequency show earned cost. Minor slip: “logically emotional” is stated more than enacted in mid-process.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—wild impatience vs. sculpting patience—drives every micro-choice; the final click embodies earned renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“wild animal clawing at her ribs”) is specific, not diagnostic. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. One reflective block (grandfather’s theft) is anchored and tilts tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor vs. empathic surrender to Finch’s obsession—is embodied in the lantern-touch beat and crystallizes in his quiet refusal to flatten the report. The cost (defying Fletcher, carrying Finch’s story) is felt on the final page. Minor slip: “fortified quiet” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arthur’s interior contradiction—faith vs. mechanical despair—is embodied in the velvet-wrapped heart and the “heavy, leaden thing” in his chest. The micro-choice to leave the heart with Elias crystallizes his shift from repairman to guide, with the cost of abandoning his prior identity. Elias’s brief presence supplies relational pressure that reframes Arthur’s vocation. Only the slight over-articulation of “I offered him scripture…” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s stubborn curiosity is embodied in every greasy micro-choice; the final “grip” command is earned by years of solitary tinkering and costs him the safety of his drifting home. Interiority is specific, tactile, and contradictory—he both reveres and mocks the cosmos. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsessive drive is embodied in every micro-choice—typing coordinates, lying to Kael, clutching the patch—so the final click carries earned cost. Interiority stays concrete: “her heart hammered against her ribs” rather than “she felt scared.” The only minor slip is the slightly expository “to Julian, it was a beautiful attempt,” but it’s brief and doesn’t undercut the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—his “to map empathy onto action” motive is dramatized through the quartz shard choice and oracle vision, but minor exposition occasionally slips into therapy-speak parameterizing his process.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—selfish learner vs. reluctant helper—are embodied in micro-choices (rolling the parasol tip, kneeling amid debris) and crystallize in the final stance of calm renunciation. Interiority is specific and sensory; no stock labels. The cost of using others’ tragedy as her textbook is acknowledged and paid in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—Mourvèdre passion vs. Grenache need—is embodied in every beat: from the way he fingers the letter to the final release of placing it away. Flaws, memory-scars, and earned stasis create a fully dimensional, solitary guide whose silence is itself an action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is precise—his quiet correction of the disciple, the ceramic mask’s coolness, the “whisperfield calm” all embody motive. The final renunciation of the pavilion’s noise carries visible cost: he walks alone into desert silence. One slip: the “strangely honest” label is asserted rather than dramatized in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s calm is embodied in the tactile ritual of arranging photographs, but the interior contradiction—his desire to “transmute pain” versus the quiet cost of witnessing—remains largely summary. The final placement of the girl’s photo is a clear micro-choice that forecloses his return, yet the stakes of that renunciation feel scaled to the town rather than to Elias himself.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s reticence, embodied wonder, and renunciation of publication come through micro-gestures and a single, visible cost: eternal witness. His flaws—the obsessiveness that once sought a “product” rather than a process—linger and are never excused, only repositioned.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between foresight and forgetting is dramatized in every beat. The final renunciation—drawing the imperfect circle—earns its cost because the prior beats show memory fraying in real time. One slip: the “prophet” label is asserted rather than revealed through action, a minor flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s lifelong ache and the photograph-lens anchor his sacrifice; the contradiction between “harness the ephemeral” and freezing time is embodied in the decisive act. Interiority is spare but specific—“gnarled fingers,” “luminous ache”—and the final stillness carries felt cost. Secondary pressure from Hima is minimal but sufficient to crystallize stakes. The choice to sacrifice the irreplaceable lens earns the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s serene kindness is embodied through micro-choices—brewing the right tea, modulating room sounds—yet her decisively kind force never encounters credible pushback; she appears more vessel than person. The father–daughter reconciliation is credible, but Elara’s interior stake (“flawless goodbye”) feels static, her contradictory impulses muted.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsessive precision and quiet deliberation are embodied in every micro-choice (rotating the key’s rings, pushing instead of turning). The interior contradiction—yearning for stability in a fluid cosmos—drives the final act and is paid for by the automaton’s single-use awakening. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the decisive gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—desire for rationalism vs longing for inherited magic—are embodied in the physical act of trowelling: his knuckles white, the chill of the tooth, the tear traced through dirt. His final micro-choice is the pen on star-chart; this specific action revalues a lifetime’s certainty, and its cost (shattered worldview) is legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete—never drifting into label-speak—anchored in the tactile work of hands and bones.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her salt-stained fingers, the weight of the glass in her palm—but the final renunciation of “wrong fire” is slightly generalized rather than dramatized as a specific cost. The contradiction between memory of village fire and present resolve is present yet not fully enacted in a micro-choice; the glow is achieved without visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s watchful-dreamer trait is embodied in her micro-choices (humidity, tea, silence) and crystallizes in the pendant transfer; Kaelen’s haunted passivity is credibly maintained until the final breath. Interiority is specific and embodied (“her fingers ghosting over the green velvet of the moss”). The closing gesture earns its cost: Elara forfeits her talisman of permanence, Kaelen accepts the possibility of thaw. Only a trace of diagnostic label-speak (“public failure”) keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for lost wonder while despising his own success—is embodied in the tightening grip on the seashell and the step against the current. The micro-choice to bury the fragment crystallizes his shift from author to keeper, with the felt cost of relinquishing authorship. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's tinkerer identity is shown through embodied details (trembling vines vs. steady brass). Interior contradiction is present but light, and the restoration motive, while clear, feels stated more than dramatized until the final choice, holding it just under top band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is embodied—bone-listening, cold knees, thumb-pressed stillness—so motives feel lived. The contradiction between urgent world fear and his enforced stillness sharpens the final cost: he gives away his own calm to anchor a stranger. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation is clear, rooted, and visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is textured and embodied—his “peripherally focused” trait drives every tactical choice, from placing pins to reading glints. Motivation (“store wonder”) is dramatized through the painstaking ledger work and the final lever push, not stated. The Earned Stasis—completion without immediate audience—carries visible cost in weeks of solitude and bodily fatigue. A hairline slip: the moment of interior contradiction could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is rich and embodied—his thumb on the brass knob, the ache of the farmer’s grief—but the final placement of the stone is a ritual repetition rather than a choice that costs him a live option; the arc is accumulative, not decisively altered.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the “hauntingly practical” stance is dramatized in her micro-choice to carve the exhale. The memory of Leo’s stillness with the cub crystallizes her motive and foreshadows the final act, but the widow identity remains more label than lived contradiction, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s regret, embodied in visceral, contradictory micro-choices, drives every beat; the final integration with his ghost is an earned renunciation that visibly forecloses pride-driven denial.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are embodied in her scavenging, wiring, and final choice; the contradiction between demolition duty and hope-seeking is dramatized through action. Interiority is specific and grounded in tactile detail. The cost—accepting that hope is a current to reroute, not an equation—is felt in her quiet, solitary stance under alien starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the contradiction between his lifelong silence and the dream of sound is dramatized in the moment he opens the coffer. The micro-choice of placing each bell—an act of renunciation—carries visible cost and aligns with his trait of excruciating gentleness. Backstory is kept within the 20 % allowance and is anchored to the present action. The final Earned Stasis feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—cold seeping into knuckles, trembling hands on the journal—yet the final epiphany leans slightly toward summary rather than fully dramatized contradiction. The sacrifice motive is credible, but the cost to Kael himself (beyond understanding) could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority concrete—Elias’s 'patient alignment' philosophy visibly constrains the knot-reading micro-choice. Contradictory impulses (urge to force vs. refusal) animate the final sketching scene, making the enduring stillness a credible, earned renunciation. Minor slip: ‘seed collector’ label lingers more than it’s dramatized through risky micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is textured and embodied; the thread as “biography in miniature” crystallizes his arc. Motivation—mapping healing—drives every beat, culminating in the earned insight that healing is containment, not erasure. The final act of writing carries visible cost: he writes until the light is gone, foreclosing any other path that evening. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s obsessive interiority and embodied frailty are vivid; the contradictory hope/dread under pressure is palpable. The final renunciation—accepting the hybrid bird as “not the one he had dreamed of”—is earned and carries visible cost. Yet the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—firefighter vs. arsonist’s blood—are dramatized in the grafting scene where compassion overrides heritage; the coin’s severance and the red thread’s binding crystallize a visible cost. Interiority is embodied (“her breath caught,” “hands of a surgeon”) and avoids label-speak. The final stance at the lagoon earns a credible renunciation of the past.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s skeptical interiority and embodied ache are vivid; the contradiction between logic and heart drives every micro-choice. The final rotation of the box crystallizes her arc with visible cost—the city’s sigh is her earned burden. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses act in scene and the renunciation (of pure skepticism) is paid for by the flood of memory she must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Xylar’s inherited sorrow and refusal to perpetuate cosmic erasure are embodied in every micro-choice; the shift from mapping sorrow to broadcasting love is a credible renunciation that costs the ancestral path. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The single flaw: the gear’s emotional weight is asserted more than dramatized in Xylar’s body.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied (the weight of names as silence, the ribbon’s texture under his fingers) and his obsession with collective grief is consistent. The spectral mentorship is evoked rather than dramatized, so the final epiphany feels slightly gifted rather than earned by contradictory impulse. Micro-choices (retracing slate, leaving the nameless stone) align with motive and carry visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is sketched with tactile habit and guilt-driven ritual—the pause in the pendulum, the oilcloth, the rake handle—that crystallize his quiet, ethics-bound crusade. Flaws (containment vs. release) animate every beat; the final renunciation carries felt cost and alters the clock’s cadence. Minor: the town itself isn’t individuated beyond collective ghost, leaving secondary characterization thin.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing threads, cross-referencing charts) that escalate to the decisive shelf-building; the final re-shelving of the case crystallizes his identity as “gardener of memory” with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, though the “blithe” tag is asserted rather than dramatized. Motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—his yearning for cultural survival against the dread of condemning the old ways—are dramatized in the micro-choice to lift the kingfisher quill. Embodied cost (the pulse in his ears) crystallizes his motive scale without lapse into therapy-speak. Drive deepens steadily to the decisive choice, validating Earned Stasis at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s quiet, disciplined obsession is realized in micro-moments: “spine straight, fingers poised” over forbidden ink, the way his pulse aligns with shortwave static. Contradictory impulses—fear clenched against devotion—manifest on the page each time the pen hovers above treacherous paper. His final decision to endure another night of danger rather than flee is driven by the earlier image of dust “learning the luminous words by heart,” an earned renunciation of safety for legacy. Cost is tangible in his clench of fear and the still mist outside.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's internal irony—that she builds shelters for others from controlled truth while knowingly withholding cost—is dramatized without summary, especially in the withheld background of the porcelain-masked artist. Kael's final tear and still-posed hand show embodied grief, but the interiority never loops into self-diagnosis; the conflict remains one of external ritual versus internal knowledge. The micro-choice of “gathering every last grain” into the urn feels earned, as it visibly severs Kael’s relationship with presence. Cost is felt: the ash never comes back, the chair will sit lifeless tomorrow, the illusion will crumble.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s layered interiority—charting longitude in grit under the ribs—rings distinct; his refusal to proselytize yet compulsively archive genius is a live contradiction that charges every micro-choice. The moment he places the cog into the velvet box he crystallizes a stoic vow whose cost is the silence he must inhabit: earned stasis at its sharpest.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the rosette as microcosm of his struggle is specific. The shift from resigned to purely expectant is earned through the breathing exercise and the cost of two years’ friction. Choir remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interior arc is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias operates clearly from the palate-as-memory conceit; every snip is a motivated beat tied to his vocation. Interiority is vivid yet avoids clichés—his tongue tasting betrayal and apathy feels lived-in. Micro-choice hierarchy culminates in the trembling leaf-taste of hope, an earned shift with a felt cost (no reversal; earned stasis). Some smoothing in early exposition keeps it just shy of the 9.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s compulsion and quiet resistance are embodied in the matchbox gesture; the interior contradiction between truth-telling and preserving wonder is dramatized, not labeled. Lena’s shift from inspector to “person tasked with reminding a city how to feel” is earned by the riddle’s cost. Minor slip: “stubborn desire to preserve wonder” edges toward summary rather than embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the orris-root pocket ritual and the hushed blaze conviction give her a distinct pulse. The final realization—that she is seeding questions, not sanctifying houses—earns its place through prior micro-choices and carries visible cost in her retreating “new lightness.” Minor slip: the phrase “inadvertently profound” is self-diagnosed rather than dramatized, blunting the contradiction that would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—crusader’s certainty vs. dawning horror—is embodied in the ampoule’s weight and the gill’s living pulse. Her micro-choice to bury the poison crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost (forfeited mission, surface exile implied). Galen’s telepathy is less a second character than a catalytic voice, so relationship crucible is thin; still, the pressure on Mara is acute and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s grim-optimist stance is embodied, not labeled; every choice (scratching proofs, choosing the die roll) stems from the same internal contradiction. Embodied regret (the asphalt smell, lock click) nails motivation. Only micro-gripe: lack of contradiction on the second roll—no flicker of doubt to sharpen the cost even further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s insomnia-as-vocation feels lived-in and idiosyncratic, particularly in his habit of counting pigments instead of sheep. The quiet, stubborn fire of his hope is dramatized rather than told—most forcefully when he physically stands on the ledge with hammering heart—and it scales credibly to 800 words. Interior contradiction arrives late: “perhaps he was just a fool… a fool.” His micro-choices (switching on spotlights, watching windows) anchor values under pressure; the only softening is the second-hand memory of umbrella-sharing, a small recoil from full interior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alistair’s interiority is vivid—his historian’s reflex with the lens, the tactile memory of the concert hall—but the shift from despair to sonic epiphany leans on summary rather than embodied contradiction. Elara’s loaf is a perfect micro-choice that crystallizes stakes, yet the council’s flat resignation weakens relational pressure. The final cost is felt: culture saved, but only through collective voice, not solitary curation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “cold fire” and “bleak exhilaration” are embodied and contradictory. Micro-choice (pulling the lever) is charged with cost: his own erasure. Reflection is anchored in present cues (ozone, brass) and tilts tactics. Flawed obsession is consistent and drives inevitable mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“a sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie”), but the whispering advisor remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is moot. The void-as-flaw is dramatized through the final unbosoming and its tactical reversal, earning the closure with visible cost. No stock therapy-speak; contradictions play out in action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s interiority is vivid—his “study in balance” and the mallet’s “thousand impacts” ground motive. The moment he strikes the cedar, contradictory impulses (fear vs. performance) fuse into embodied action with visible cost: the orchard’s timbers now “humming with the storm’s song.” No relationship crucible is on-page, but the solo arc earns credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing salt-bleached charts, raising the whistle—until the final crack crystallizes the cost of knowledge. Interior contradiction (hope vs. dread) pulses beneath every breathy note. The moment the whistle fractures, his mother’s fate and his own path are irrevocably reweighted; the reader feels the irreversible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s emotionally rational stance is embodied in his measured cadence and refusal to demand the case; Elara’s contradictory impulses—guardian vs. curator of weakness—surface in the millstone image. The micro-choice of sliding the vellum across the dust earns the renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“structural weakness”) nicks the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—stoic surveyor vs. tender archivist—are embodied in every micro-choice (inkwell rescue, sealing the note). The final Earned Stasis of solitary guardianship is fully earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “archeologist of abandoned dreams” edges toward label-speak, though it is quickly grounded in ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet, methodical interiority is vivid and consistent; the coral stamp becomes an embodied extension of his values. The final renunciation—to correct rather than expose—earns its cost through prior beats of careful observation and tactile discovery. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual—polishing the gem, folding the crane—so motive stays legible. Interior contradiction surfaces when the dream’s promise collides with its impossibility, forcing a credible shift from drowning to current-riding. The cost is the forever-broken future he must still carry; this renunciation is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amal’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—gripping the console, clutching the geode, feeding memory into equations. The interior contradiction (scientific detachment vs. raw mourning) is palpable and consistent. The final crystallized stance—coordinates in hand, grief now vectored—earns its cost from every prior beat. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “perpetually surprised” face is a concrete, recurring tic that modulates under pressure. Motivation—decoding the “frequency of belonging”—is dramatized through micro-choices (slotting the chip, guiding the drone, straining to pull the ring) rather than stated. The final smile shows earned change with visible cost (isolation foreclosed, new knowledge embraced). Minor slip: “lonely operator” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt and singular drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices (thumb in the gouge, clutching the two artifacts). The refusal to fabricate memories for himself and the pivot to restoration crystallize a cost-laden stance. Interior contradiction—pride turned curse—threads every beat. Final purpose is earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is precise—his tactile worry of the brass lion, the “recycle mistakes into wisdom” motive—yet the moment of crystallized choice (fitting the pull as key) is slightly under-dramatized; we feel the cost but not the full contradiction inside it. Kaelen’s presence supplies external pressure, but her interior remains opaque, limiting the crucible effect. Still, the earned stasis at the end—wisdom without forgiveness—lands with credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the sea vs. fear of repeating failure—are embodied in trembling hand, compass-as-judge, and the final step onto sand. Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. The micro-choice to raise the compass over water rather than pocket it crystallizes a hierarchy of values and forecloses retreat with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—numbness vs. the ghost-pull of the past—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (the hand on the baseball, the decision to descend). The final spark of empathy is earned by the prior trail of clues he himself laid, carrying visible cost in the letter’s despair. Minor slip: “a tiny, fragile spark” flirts with label-speak but is immediately grounded in the bioluminescent image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s grief-driven resolve is embodied in every motion; the micro-choice to surrender to the scales is credible and costly. Interiority is specific—his hatred of the change collides with his need for Lyra. The final fusion earns its poignancy because his earlier resistance is dramatized, not stated. One slip: “reluctant metamorphosis” is named more than enacted until late.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the trembling hand at the linen cloth crystallizes her flaw. The shift from frantic seeker to steady mother is earned through the unfastening and the traced vow. Only the “willingly perplexed” label feels slightly diagnostic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her gravitational buoyancy under joy, her leaden collapse under grief—creating a vivid, character-bound emotional palette. The pacifist stance is dramatized through the method of acceptance rather than assertion, and the final self-forgiveness is earned by the slow accumulation of prior stitches. One minor slip: the phrase “ghostly resolve that had settled deep in her bones” edges toward stock, but the body-weight motif rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s curiosity is embodied in the tactile walk and the deliberate release of light; the final kneel and palm-to-sand moment crystallizes a felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “philanthropist of moments” line edges toward label-speak, blunting the contradiction needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his “winking hush” mask versus the tremor in his veins—but the contradiction never sharpens into a visible cost; the smile at the end feels unearned because no flaw or misbelief is confronted. The bronze quill holder is handled twice, yet its emotional weight is asserted rather than dramatized. Still, micro-choices (the feigned inspection, the coded clicks) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—magnetic boots groaning, eels’ panic felt in his ribs—and the promise to Elara drives every beat. The contradictory pull between passive foresight and active intervention is embodied in the micro-choice to pour star dust. Cost is legible: the spiral and his years of work survive, yet the curse endures. One slip: “precognitively cursed” edges toward label-speak mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—“screaming hurricane” vs “statue of calm”—is embodied in the trembling hands that open the envelope; the micro-choice to wind the timer crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The final shift from mapping scars to developing them is earned by the prior hour of rarefaction and the cost is felt in the “terrifying journey” ahead. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s brass arm, wry patience, and habit of turning philosophical riddles into physical journeys are fully built into every micro-choice—especially the way he reads Elara’s sundial as a coded duel field. The slight deduction is for interior monologues that occasionally drift into polished essay rather than tension-charged interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is vivid ("Architect vs Reckoner") and contradictions surface momentarily, but Elara functions more as mirror than crucible; silence, poems, and tentative drifters crystallize a communal stance, yet Silas’s personal stakes flatten after the false-bottom tin reveal, leaving the cost communal, not private.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s grief-forged resolve is embodied in tactile micro-choices (fingers on keys, studying film flaws), but interior contradiction is asserted more than dramatized; the “blade” metaphor is vivid yet abstract. Motivation is clear and escalates to the decisive step-through, yet the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—methodical empiricist forced into intuitive leap—is embodied in micro-choices (clutching seed, humming the lullaby). The luminous doubt persists as earned cost, not tidy resolution. One slip: “her job was to sift fact” is label-speak that momentarily flattens voice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kenji’s interiority is embodied and specific—his shears, the salt air, the compass weight in his palms. The contradiction between his placid ritual and the churning grief is dramatized in micro-choices (tracing lace, climbing bluff). The final diffusion of guilt is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the compass light fades, regret thins but does not vanish. Only the “cerulean regret” label skirts diagnostic speak, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("spike of pure grief" vs seeking detachment) acts simultaneously in orchid scene; final shovel choice earned through micro-choices like returning daily. Slight acceleration of emotional shift prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices—shaking hands versus dawn observations—without therapy-speak. Final kiln relighting earns closure via prior causality (week of frost alignment), with visible cost in enduring the cold dawns.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority shines through embodied thermal metaphors ("jagged, searing orange"), but "unshaken marvels" borders on thematic statement. Final choice earned via cereus interaction, though "silently expressive" trait lacks tested tradeoffs under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "inadvertently stubborn" resolve born of desperation; embodied exhaustion ("weariness etched deeper than lines") avoids therapy-speak. Final silence earned through prior causality with palpable cost in "cold, wet sand" settling. No second character present, so relationship bullets irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s embodied emotion ("hollowed cheeks of children") and micro-choice to ring the bell (not ambush) reveal contradictory impulses. Slight deduction for "true motivation" line tipping toward summary rather than dramatized shift.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "phantom limb of lost connection" and breathing cycles. Contradictory impulses (clarity vs mystery) drive micro-choices without tidy resolution. Final endurance earns cost through visceral shift from "void" to "resonance."

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation for "texture of time" is concrete and embodied through Elias' tactile obsession with memory decay. Interior contradiction (monastic focus vs. unraveling mind) drives choices, though "retrocognitively trapped" risks diagnostic label-speak (-0.3). Micro-choices like reaching for his wife's blurred image reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "body bound/purpose free" closure, but internal conflict lacks visible struggle during key action; strategic calm edges toward over-calibration without irrational layering.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses (seeking pain vs. needing healing) manifest in micro-choices like unsealing jars; closure renunciation earned through cellular "mending" cost. Avoids diagnostic label-speak via embodied synesthesia ("teeth ache" during aurora). Slight over-tidiness in final insight caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation ("press ear against destiny’s door") evolves credibly into custodianship of possibilities, with embodied contradiction in "fear and part exhilaration" and micro-choices (transit maps over tools) tightening under pressure; flat portraits’ inertness post-heist shows earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (creating permanence vs. accepting impermanence) drives the abandonment choice. Minor deduction for near-diagnostic phrasing in the thawing heart realization that edges toward thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in embodied fear vs. adaptive resolve, but "proving vulnerability is power" motivation lacks contradictory impulses in choices; diagnostic phrasing slightly undermines climax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority shows precise cartographer’s focus but lacks contradictory impulses; "mild obsession" drives micro-choices yet no internal tension surfaces under pressure. Motivation is concrete but the final renunciation lacks layered conflict beyond serene completion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-choices under pressure (ignoring/shattering/sweeping violin) reveal hierarchy of values with reset cost. Strength: embodied epiphany via "G-string flat" memory. Weakness: limited physicality for "composed" trait beyond calm error bypass.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "yearned to thaw frost" yet "no longer knew shape of honest words"; micro-choices (polishing lens, keeping tickets) reveal hierarchy of values. Transformation slightly too neat in tear moment, lacking grit in pivotal thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's embodied contradiction (pragmatic actions vs. belief in "living wisdom") drives the victory choice; manager's thin but sufficient as pressure source. Final marble-cracking earns stakes through prior causality. Minor flaw: manager's dialogue lacks distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s obliging nature versus quiet vertigo at multitudes; embodied emotion ("falling sideways into an ocean of possibility") avoids labels. Aris’s obsession feels lived-in but lacks secondary pressure beyond the lever pull.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's embodied obsession with the water-damaged program shows concrete motivation, but lacks contradictory impulses (e.g., fear of desecration vs. need to know). Final choice to play the music earns closure through visible cost of destroying the artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values: avoiding Liam's desk, then placing the illustration on the windowsill. Embodied emotion ("auroral sorrow," "indigestible stone") avoids labels. Final endurance—keeping ambiguity—is earned by the smudge realization, with visible cost in the "atmosphere she now breathed."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("skeptical man" vs. acting on psychic logic) and embodied emotion ("silence a physical pressure") shine; micro-choices like grabbing the valve with "crushing weight" of guilt perfectly earn closure. Slight deduction for underdeveloped "recklessness" beyond one mention.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; "obsessive precision" versus fluid reality manifests as consistent method rather than clashing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; the stillness motif is embodied but emotional layers feel curated rather than authentically conflicted. Final thumb-seal action earns endurance through prior tactile details ("knees cracking").

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction evident in peripheral focus method; embodied emotion through pin placement and ledger entries. Final choice earned by accumulated studies, but micro-choices lack visible cost escalation beyond time expenditure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Limited interior contradiction; motivation clear but static ("boundary-lessly trapped" shown not told).

    Interiority anchored in concrete cues (thread texture, phantom loom ache) avoids therapy-speak; micro-choice of writing under dying light shows hierarchy of values. Lacks contradictory impulses in Elara's off-page motivation despite vivid projection.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses (firefighter vs. arsonist's daughter) act simultaneously in the graft scene; final choice to sever the coin earns endurance with visible cost ("vibrant color a stark promise").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's "luminous skeptic" interiority shines through embodied contradiction (logical mind vs. heartache), with micro-choices like the millimeter box rotation revealing her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's contradictory role (deceiver/healer) and Kael's embodied fragility anchor choices, but limited interiority in short form prevents 9.0. Key omission: Kael's grief lacks specific sensory memory beyond portfolio clutch.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Silas' resignation ("not defeated, only resignedly certain") amid futility, with micro-choices like cleaning the cog revealing his hierarchy of values. Lacks visceral embodiment of his "cold ache" beyond intellectual acknowledgment, slightly muting the cost.

Final humming scene earns change through prior causality—carving noise concept applied physically—without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
